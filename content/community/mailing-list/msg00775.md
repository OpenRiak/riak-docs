Morning, Afternoon, Evening to all,

It's my last day at OSCON, so I'm a bit sad, but we have some truly
awesome stuff happening in the Riak Community, so that make up for it!

Enjoy today's Recap and have a great weekend.

Riak Recap for 7/21-7/22


1) The Riak Map Reduce Webinar happened yesterday. For those of you
who weren't able to make it, we actually made good on our promise to
record it this time.

Slides here ---&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/dreverri/riak-mapreduce

2) I got a chance to catch up with @mootpointer at OSCON and chat a
bit their Riak usage at Lexer.

\\*\\*\\* I'm looking to do more of these videos, so if anyone wants to
spend a few minutes talking about how and why they are using Riak, get
in touch with me. I want to talk to you.

3) D Zone put together an article based on the release of 0.12 and the
announcement of the Riak San Francisco Meetup.

4) Looks like @jebui decided to take a pass at a Tokyo Cabinet back
end for Riak based . Definitely something to keep an eye on. Thanks,
Jebu!

5) The Riakjs.org site was turned on this morning (as far as I know).
Riak-js is the js lib started by @frank06 and it looks he is now
working with @siculars, @freshtonic, and @botanicus. The site is
awesome (and I hear the library isn't too shabby, either). Thanks,
guys!

And it also made a bit of splash on Hacker News ---&gt;
