Hello all,

We're seeing enough thrashing and low-memory on our production ring that
we've decided to upgrade our hardware. The real question is should we scale
up or out.

Currently our ring is 512 partitions. We know that it's a sub-optimal size
but we can't easily solve that now. We're currently running a search-heavy
app on 5 8GB VMs. I'm debating between moving the VMs up to 16GB, or adding
a few more 8GB VMs.

Some of the talk in #riak has pushed me towards adding more machines (thus
lowering the per node number of partitions) but I wanted to do a quick
sanity check here with folks that it's better than scaling up my current
machines.

Thanks!
Ken Perkins
