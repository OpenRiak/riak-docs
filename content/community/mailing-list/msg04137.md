Could it be possible to have "SuperColums" as Cassandra has? ( "SuperBuckets" would be more ideal name )I think it would be a great improvement if we can query a bucket without having to look at all buckets and keys in memory to search for it... this way it would be easier and faster to modulate data so if you distribute data in small buckets, the MapReduce on them would get faster... not sure if is possible to implement, but is something i really would love to have in Riak and it would help me a lot in my project... knowing that atomizing buckets ( "rohman\\_messages", "fyodor\\_messages" ) has no advantage over a huge "messages" bucket really disappointed me.thanksRohman
