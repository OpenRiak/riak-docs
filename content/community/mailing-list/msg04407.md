Hey Bill,

If you write an Erlang MR, you are just given the raw bucket data, so
there's no reason you shouldn't be able to do it. That said, I've never done
it, but would be really interested if you figure it out.

&gt; In order to run a map reduce query v.s. Riak, does the data need to be

&gt; Thanks!
