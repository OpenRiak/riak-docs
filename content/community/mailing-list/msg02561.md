We are working on some internal prototypes of secondary indices which will 
solve some of those types of problems. There's no timeline on when (or if) 
they will be released.

&gt;&gt; Does Riak Search support timestamps? The majority of my data is
&gt;&gt; queried using timestamps; e.g. the last three hours of data or the
&gt;&gt; snapshot from Jan 20th at 08:00:01 etc.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Mike, you can format the timestamp into ISO8601 basic:
&gt;&gt; [YYYY][MM][DD]T[hh][mm][ss]
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; This has the nice property of sorting in chronological order.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any hope for a more natural concept of time 'ranges' in riak? Maybe 
&gt; some kind of indexing that would avoid the full bucket scan that you need 
&gt; even with a key prefix match?
