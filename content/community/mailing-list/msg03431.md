In software products that have containment metaphors, how often do we
see a function return a cached value rather than the up-to-date
value, especially for products that manage shared data?


Pretty frequently, actually. Every Ruby ORM I've used caches
associations by default. Even when listing is cheap, deserialization isn't.

For some reason this never tripped me up; I recall looking at the rdoc
and finding it quite obvious that this method had a :reload option. But 
if you just guessed at the existence of #keys, it is probably (like many 
things about Riak) surprising! :)
