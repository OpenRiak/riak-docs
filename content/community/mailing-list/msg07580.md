&gt; &gt; Hey there!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just thought I'd let you guys know that I just released a new version of
&gt; the Riak Handbook, a free update if you already bought it. It comes with
&gt; more than 40 pages of new content, focussing primarily on use cases and
&gt; usage scenarios (data modelling, access patterns, pros and cons),
&gt; operations (lots of details on monitoring, load-balancing and network
&gt; placement of nodes), pre- and post-commit, plus a whole slew of little
&gt; additions and fixes. Also, the book now comes as a man page for easy
&gt; reading on the command line.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You can read all about what's in the release here:
&gt; http://www.paperplanes.de/2012/5/30/riak-handbook-11-is-out.html
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To celebrate, the book is 25% off through next Monday:

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers, Mathias
