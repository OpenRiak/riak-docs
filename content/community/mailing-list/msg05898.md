Hi All,

Anyone out there using Riak with Clojure in some capacity? Or wanting
to use Riak with Clojure? I was hoping I might borrow a few minutes of
your time for the betterment of Riak and Clojure. (I'm not afraid to
use stickers and t-shirts to make it worth your while.)

If this is you, please email me off-list.

Thanks.

Mark
