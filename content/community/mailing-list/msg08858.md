maybe the good start is to share pbclient object and only create
bucket per request, you will save few steps on client configuration.
have you tried balancing requests to cluster and distribute them over all nodes?

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; I have Riak cluster consisting of 5 nodes that contains about 30 millions of
&gt; keys (35% of capacity according to Riak Control).
&gt; Currently we have single JAVA client reading and writing records to same
&gt; node. I need some tips, how to use the client efficiently
&gt; to reach maximal throughput - I would like to be able to read/write up to
&gt; 100 records/sec on 1Gbit network. Currently I get a lot
&gt; of JAVA socket exceptions after a while (even for the much slower rate - 10
&gt; records/sec), after which I need to restart client and node.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Pavel
&gt;
&gt; P.S: My client using 50 threads and pbc client is created and shut-downed
&gt; per request.
