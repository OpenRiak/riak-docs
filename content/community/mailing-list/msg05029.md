Anton,

No, that is not possible directly in Riak. However, if you use a reverse
proxy in front of Riak, you could restrict HTTP methods to only POST, for
instance, and filter out requests where the key is included in the URL. An
appropriate response from the proxy might be a 403 for invalid URL/method
combinations.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have question regarding buckets configuration.
&gt;
&gt; I want to be able just to save some document to bucket but not update it or
&gt; delete. E.x. history bucket in which just read-only revisions will be
&gt; stored.
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible to make it via bucket configuration inside riak?
