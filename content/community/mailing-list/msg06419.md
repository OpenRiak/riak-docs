Adam, 

There's a basic explanation in our wiki: 
http://wiki.basho.com/Vector-Clocks.html#VNode-Vector-Clocks. 

Requests to a vnode are processed in serial, but for a given bucket-key pair 
there's no guarantee that the same vnode will coordinate separate requests. 
Thus, two writes to the same bucket-key pair can take place at the same time, 
resulting in siblings. The main advantage of vnode\\_vclocks is that it places a 
limit on the length of vclocks as the actors identified in the vclock are the 
coordinating vnodes rather than clients. Long vclocks are a problem for two 
reasons: they are space inefficent and they induce vclock pruning, a process 
wherein the number of entries in a vclock are reduced to save space. There are 
conditions where vclock pruning can result in sibling generation.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; i'm having trouble articulating for colleagues why using vnode\\_vclock=true in 
&gt; Riak 1.0 avoids the issues outlined in the Vector Clocks are Hard page. This 
&gt; is probably a sign that i don't understand it well enough myself. 
&gt; 
&gt; My understanding is that requests to a vnode are processed in serial so that 
&gt; the vector clock updates in a vnode are guaranteed to not create duplicates 
&gt; for a particular object (causing the data loss.) If this is correct, does it 
&gt; mean that write operations are done in serial, or that both read and writes 
&gt; are processed in serial? Also is it still just using an incrementing number 
&gt; or using something like a timestamp as the vector clock value for the client? 
&gt; 
&gt; I would love to be able to get a good explanation for this so I can 
&gt; understand it better myself and so that I can articulate it to colleagues. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Adam
