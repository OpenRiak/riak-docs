Hi,
I have some modules with js functions for named MR.
But for some keys, I get the message that my module is undefined:
{"lineno":1,"message":"ReferenceError: GetTotal is not
defined","source":"unknown"}
If it's defined for some keys why it's not for the others (although they
have same values)?

Thanks,
