The init.d script for RIak is included in the RPM. If you list the file
contained in the RPM do you see the init.d/riak script? If you do have
that file, you'll need to add the rc.d scripts by hand to auto-start /
auto-stop on startup / shutdown or use a tool like `chkconfig`

&gt; I did these steps and while I see that Riak has been added to the system

&gt; Do I add these links manually?

&gt; If you are looking install and /etc/init.d support, you should really just
&gt; be installing the packages.
&gt; http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/riak/CURRENT/rhel/6/riak-1.2.1-1.el6.x86\\_64.rpmis
&gt; the package for Centos 6 found here
&gt; http://basho.com/resources/downloads/. Building from source is there for
&gt; those who need a feature not currently in a release, want to make additions
&gt; to Riak, or are on an unsupported platform.

&gt;&gt; I am looking at http://docs.basho.com/riak/\\*\\*latest/cookbooks/Basic-\\*\\*
&gt;&gt; Cluster-Setup/which
&gt;&gt; provides me with a lot of information. But I have one question. I
&gt;&gt; have a source distribution and I have already done 'make rel'. Once I have
&gt;&gt; performed all of the steps outlined in setting up a cluster how do I make
&gt;&gt; sure that this configuration is restored when the machine reboots. I am
&gt;&gt; assuming that it will involve something with /etc/init.d. Is there
&gt;&gt; something like 'make install' that would shorten the process? How is the
&gt;&gt; cluster information persisted so that each node will join the cluster when
&gt;&gt; the respective machine comes up after a reboot? Thank you.
