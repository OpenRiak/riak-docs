&gt; Hi All, 
&gt; 
&gt; I need a bit if help. I'm trying to get an impression of how many 
&gt; people/companies/orgs out there are using or planning to use Riak and Node.js 
&gt; in some form (either via riak-js [1] or some other cool code we don't even 
&gt; know about yet).
&gt; 
&gt; If this is you, please let me know. (On- or off-list will work.) 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
