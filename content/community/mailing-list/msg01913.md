Erjang is a nice and fun toy, but it's too much of a hack to be useful
for Riak. If you want to use a JVM-based language try Scala and leave
Erlang as is :-) One of the main problems with porting Riak to other
platforms is not Erlang itself, but the C/C++ code Riak uses through
port drivers and NIFs. Using a JVM won't help there...

&gt; Oh interesting :-)

&gt; In addition, I heard that Riak had also been made to run on Erjang; if that 
&gt; were the case you could in theory already run it on windows via the JVM. 
&gt; Really must find time to try this...
&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have an experimental Riak build for Windows... There's still some

&gt;&gt;&gt; share my Windows binaries (once they are ready for public
&gt;&gt;&gt; consumption). Let me know...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Definitely share those binaries once you think they are ready for the
&gt;&gt; spotlight. There are numerous parties who are interested in building
&gt;&gt; Riak on Windows and, as Justin pointed out above, Basho's resources
&gt;&gt; are a bit constrained at the moment, so any help we (and the
&gt;&gt; community) could get in this respect would be much appreciated.
