Hi,

I asked two questions on the Basho Blog about secondary indexes 4 days ago[1]. 
However, they seem to have gone unnoticed. I'm posting them here instead:

1. Will indexes automatically be updated when documents are deleted? Is it 
necessary to set 'x-riak-index-\\*' headers when deleting documents?
2. If I forget to include the 'x-riak-index-\\*' header when performing an 
update, will the index not be touched at all (and thus become corrupt), or will 
that object be removed from indexes, or will the indexes specified at the first 
set/insertion always automatically be updated?

Regards,
Jens
