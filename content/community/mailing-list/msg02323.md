Is riak suitable as a very reliable store where you have multiple feeds 
of streaming data that are at least theoretically identical? That is, 
can you count on writing multiple copies with the same keys at the same 
time to do something reasonable regardless of cluster partitioning? And 
is this a common usage scenario?
