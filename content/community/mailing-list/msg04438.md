Ah, is this the "It won't work on the latest and greatest Erlang" issue that 
crops up every now and then?

&gt;&gt; When I attempt to follow the wiki directions for getting started with the

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thoughts? Experiences?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm pretty sure that's caused by the wrong version of Erlang. You can
&gt; correct the error by prefixing the ip\\_address type with inet: to give
&gt; you inet:ip\\_address() but you'll likely run into NIF compilation errors
&gt; later on in the build.
