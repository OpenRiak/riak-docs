Riak 0.14.2 was not built for OSX unfortunately. Before now, the OSX
builds were simply done by hand by doing a 'make rel' and packaging the
results of the 'rel/riak' directory. This manual step was not done for
0.14.1 or 0.14.2. OSX packaging has been added to riak mainline now
though, so all future releases will be built for OSX. For now, you can
produce your own binaries in the way I mentioned above.

Sorry for the inconvenience and confusion.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I went to download Riak for Mac OS, and started to follow the instructions
&gt; on:
&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/Installing-on-Mac-OS-X.html
&gt;
&gt; It says to download:
&gt; http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-0.14/riak-0.14.2-osx-i386.tar.gz
&gt;
&gt; However, that resource does not exist. There is only 0.14.0:
&gt; http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-0.14/riak-0.14.0-osx-i386.tar.gz
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Something needs to be fixed :-)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
