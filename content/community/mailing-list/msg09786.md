Shaan,

While you may be able to specify the entire bucket as input, map
functions only operate on a single input object. If you want to
operate across the entire set, use reduce. (Note that in order to
fetch the objects, you will need a map phase, even if it just returns
its input.)

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm exploring the erlang-riak-client and trying to write MapReduce functions
&gt; to mimic the ones I've written in Javascript and in the riak-ruby-client.
&gt;
&gt; Following the tutorial here, I have successfully run the query. I have now
&gt; loaded a bucket with 10000 keys into Riak and now I want to write a simple
&gt; map function that queries the bucket and returns all of the objects back to
&gt; me.
&gt;
&gt; I noticed that the input is specified as {&lt;&lt;"groceries"&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;"mine"&gt;&gt;}. Is
&gt; there is a way to specify just the bucket in its entirety? If I wanted to
&gt; query my bucket, would I have to list all 10000 keys in a list?
&gt;
&gt; In the riak-ruby-client, it was possible to add the entire bucket.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help! I'm sure this is a silly question, but I've been hard
&gt; pressed to find good documentation for a novice like me.
&gt;
&gt; Shaan
