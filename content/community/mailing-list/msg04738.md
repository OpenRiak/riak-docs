Hi,

Can we by any chance rename riak bucket??
Also Deletion all keys in a bucket is taking a lot of time:
30 secs for 10000 records which means 3 millisecs for 1 record.
I am using java client to do this.
Kindly tell if I can increase the speed or rename the bucket.

Thanks in Advance

Vicky Khanna
