Hi Mridul,

The standard analyzer will automatically convert all letters to lowercase,
so all you need to do is create a custom schema for your JSON field names
using {analyzer\\_factory, {erlang, text\\_analyzers,
standard\\_analyzer\\_factory}} and set the schema as it described in the
documentation[0].

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I was trying Riak's auto-indexed search on a bucket using the standard pre
&gt; commit hook. The JSON objects that I save have title and description fields
&gt; which need to be treated as full text search.
&gt;
&gt; Problem is that I could not find how to do case insensitive full text
&gt; search on the bucket. In the document at
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Riak-Search---Schema/ I can
&gt; see that "standard analyzer" is what is required for full text search. How
&gt; can I set this analyzer in the Riak key value search?
