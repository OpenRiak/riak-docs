Hi,
Coda Hale (http://codahale.com) was kind enough to offer some brilliant 
suggestions based on their use of riak at Yammer (http://yammer.com). I have 
incorporated his ideas into a new sketch of the API and once again I'd really 
appreciate it if those of you that have the time could take a look and let me 
know your thoughts.

I have used the fluent ideas from Krestan's original suggestions and Coda's 
ideas for conflict resolution, retry and object value mutation. 

I've pushed a sketch to a new branch 
https://github.com/russelldb/riak-java-client-api/tree/fluent, there is some 
sample code in the BasicOperations text (and the README)

Cheers

Russell

&gt; Really cool to see general thoughts on java driver. Non related: +1 Jetty 
&gt; driver - pretty granular api behavior plus intuitive interface. Also 
&gt; Stringtree offers a flawless mapping of hashmap - json and seems pretty
