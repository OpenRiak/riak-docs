Agreed. So it therefore makes sense to start using the PBC from the outset, 
allowing for future moving of the client app off any cluster node(s) it might 
be residing on, as well as not being affecting by any subtle changes to the 
internals of the riak\\_kv code base (specifically the non-PB modules).
