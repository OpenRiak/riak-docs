allow\\_mult=false and last\\_write\\_wins=false is the default. If you reread
the description [1] it's the same thing as saying allow\\_mult=false only.

To be perfectly clear (allow\\_mult=false + last\\_write\\_win=false) ==
(allow\\_mult=false).

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; The document at http://wiki.basho.com/Vector-Clocks.html describes
&gt; behaviour of Riak when allow\\_mult is true and when allow\\_mult is false but
&gt; last\\_write\\_wins is true. However, I can't find any description of what
&gt; happens when both allow\\_mult and last\\_write\\_wins are false and concurrent
&gt; writes, or writes with stale vector clock happen. Is this specified
&gt; somewhere?
