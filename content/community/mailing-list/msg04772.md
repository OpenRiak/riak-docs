All -

I'd like to re-raise this issue I raised back in June. It's rearing its head 
again.

The problem occurs when:

1) you require something that requires \\*a later version (&gt;= 3) of\\* builder, or
2) you require something that requires \\*no particular version\\* of builder, but 
a builder v. 3 exists in the gem home, and is loaded before riak-client

(See error output in forwarded message.)

Can this version restriction be removed so that builder 3 is ok with 
riak-client? Or, can a riak-client developer confirm that version 3 will not 
work, and if this is the case, if there is any plan to modify riak-client so 
that it does?

Or am I misunderstanding something about this issue?

Thanks,
Keith

&gt; All -
&gt; 
&gt; I'm getting the following error when running my rspecs for my project:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems.rb:274:in `activate': can't activate 
&gt;&gt; builder (~&gt; 2.1.2, runtime) for ["riak-client-0.9.4"], already activated 
&gt;&gt; builder-3.0.0 for ["savon-0.9.1"] (Gem::LoadError)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Would it be possible to remove the riak client's requirement not to exceed 
&gt; version 2.1?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Keith
