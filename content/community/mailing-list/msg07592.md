Hey Theo,

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I'm fairly new to riak. However I managed to setup a 5 node riak cluster on 5 
&gt; centos servers. But when I look at the ring view in riak-control I see much 
&gt; more. Like 65.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone please explain?
&gt; 


Congrats on getting that cluster up and running. May it grow well past 5 nodes. 
:) 

The ring view shows the number of partitions and which ip owns them (which by 
default = 64) Conversely, the Cluster page will show only the physical nodes. 

Check out the Riak Control page on the wiki [1] and the Clustering information 
on the wiki [2] for more information on Control and how partitions work, 
respectively. 

Hope that helps.
