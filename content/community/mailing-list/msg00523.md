Good question. That won't quite do it, because the node will give up
ownership of the partitions first, and that will cause it to begin
pushing off that data to the new owners.

We hope to add a more obvious sign in the stats resource for this, but
for now the easiest way to tell is to just look at the disk usage in
the exiting node's data directory. It should become empty when the
node completes handing off data.
