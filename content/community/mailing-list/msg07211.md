We're running Riak Control within a controlled VPN environment, so
we'd like to turn off basic auth completely. However, when we set auth
to "none", we still get prompted for basic auth, the only difference
is any old username and password will work. Is there any way to turn
off the prompt completely? We're on 1.1.1 (just upgraded - woot!)

Thanks,
