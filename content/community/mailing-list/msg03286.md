The startup scripts for riak and riaksearch don't work particularly well with 
runit (riaksearch console doesn't seem to do it). I suppose this
is because of the special way that riak is started. Anyone have a pointer to 
where I can read about the startup procedure? Or would you
recommend against this for some reason?
