I'm currently running six Riak nodes on EC2 small instances behind an ELB.
This works fine for us - although when running a large map reduce task we
connect directly to a single node rather than routing through the ELB. I
don't have any actual performance statistics to hand, but I could get some
if the list is interested.

&gt; I wonder what happens if one would run a Riak cluster on 5/10/15+ EC2
&gt; micro (or small) Linux machines behind Elastic Load Balance? Do you think
&gt; it would perform well enough for a web site with moderate traffic. Idea is
&gt; having many many "small" machines rather than couple of "big" machines.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone has any experience with something similar?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Matt,
&gt; Haproxy is my load balancer of choice. You can always run multiple copies
&gt; of haproxy and use some type of dynamic dns with it.
&gt;
&gt; We do this in many cases. Haproxy scales well. I've seen a single node
&gt; sustain multiple gigabits per second with almost no sweat.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.

&gt; Dear list,
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have an opinion on the concept of putting a Riak cluster
&gt; behind a load balancer?
&gt;
&gt; We wish to be able to automatically add/remove nodes from the cluster, so
&gt; adding an extra layer at the front is desirable. We should also benefit for
&gt; incoming requests behind shared across all nodes.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone see any drawbacks / problems with doing this?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Matt
