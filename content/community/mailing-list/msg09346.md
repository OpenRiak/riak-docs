Apart from retrieving all keys and deleting the records from the client, you 
can delete them through a map reduce job. I created a map phase function that 
deletes all keys passed in, and it is available in my map reduce utilities 
library (https://github.com/whitenode/riak\\_mapreduce\\_utils). There is an 
example in the documentation of how to delete all keys belonging to a specific 
bucket in the README file.

There is also a reduce phase function available in riak\\_function\\_contrib that 
also allows deletion of keys passed in 
(http://contrib.basho.com/delete\\_keys.html).

Best regards,

Christian
