Riak Recap for 9/27 - 9/28

1) For anyone on the Eastern Seaboard in the U.S., various basho
developers will be talking at three different conferences over the
next few days in Baltimore, Maryland.

2) siculars, frank06, a fake frank06, ericlfo and jdmaturen had a
lengthy conversation about a specific use case and whether or not Riak
was the right fit.

3) seancribbs and decklane had a short exchange around n\\_val,
replicas, and what that means for the actual size of your data set.
