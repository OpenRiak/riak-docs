The fact that it allows any client to execute arbitrary code as the database 
user, on the database server? You can call 'os:cmd' to shell out from a M-R 
job. You can't do that directly in MySQL.

I think this requirement should be extended to: "Don't allow clients to connect 
who aren't equivalent to the database UID on the server". If you have a Rails 
front-end and a Riak back-end, you can't let them talk without some application 
proxy between, filtering out all but the simplest queries (no M-R).

We have our front-end servers talking to a simple scheduling back-end over a 
single port, and all other ports are blocked. That scheduler can talk to Riak, 
but the front-end can't directly.

&gt;&gt; announced a publicly accessible Riak cluster today; with his 
&gt;&gt; permission/supervision I used this exploit to gain shell access to his 
&gt;&gt; server. He's taken down that cluster and encouraged me to release this 
&gt;&gt; information.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I love the idea of a public sandbox for Riak--but it should be wrapped 
&gt;&gt; in a rate-limiting HTTP proxy that only allows certain URLs, object 
&gt;&gt; sizes, and methods. And limits the number of keys. :)
