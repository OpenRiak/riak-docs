I see I'm not the only one that spot it, I have insisted several times 
to upgrade Jackson libraries to version 1.9.9 and later to 1.9.10 with 
no avail, I'm not sure how important it is for Riak java client team to 
keep the POM healthy. That's why we keep our Riak java client copy, 
merge from master and keep our customized changes.


And yes, indeed, there is noticeable performance, scanning dependency by 
dependency and check what they have fixed should be a periodic task to 
keep the project healthy. Specially for Jackson where for many is the 
core of the schema-less concept (POJO-to-JSON and JSON-to-POJO)

Guido.

Hi,

FYI: I just filed this jackson issue:

https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/33

Removing the mentioned "InternCache" improved the riak-java-client 
performance a lot, at least for my case :)
