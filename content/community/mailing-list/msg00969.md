hello,

when i have a simple json bucket entry like this: http://pastebin.com/XcWcvmYe
than i always get an error: 

{"lineno":483,"message":"JSON.parse","source":"unknown"} 

the stacktrace is here: http://pastebin.com/EGzUKqps

when i try to use a much simpler JSON string than there is no error.

this must be some fault of the JSON.parse method ... 

thx for pointing me in the right direction ...
