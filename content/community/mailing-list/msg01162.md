The default vnode number is 64. If you are connecting 63 physical 
nodes togeter in one riak cluster than you really want to increase the 
number of vnodes. There is some recommended metric for physical nodes 
to vnodes. I think it's like a minimum of 4 vnodes per physical node. 
But I could be totally making that up.

Hey guys,

My team was trying to launch a 63 node Riak cluster yesterday, using 
version 0.13rc3 and the bitcask backend.


All 63 nodes agreed that the ring consisted of nodes 1-42 only.

Any ideas? Is there a hardcoded limit to the number of nodes allowed?
