I don't have a Lion system to test it out, but I suspect it is due to the
"uname -s" command in eleveldb/c\\_src/leveldb/build\\_detect\\_platform returning
something different for Lion than it does for Snow Leopard. If you take a
look in that file, it is pretty simple to see what is going on and it might
be a simple fix. Otherwise, I'll wrangle up someone with a Lion machine
tomorrow and have a look.

Thanks,
Jared
