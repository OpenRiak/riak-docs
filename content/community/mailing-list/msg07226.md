&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; From this Riak Search's
&gt; page (http://wiki.basho.com/MapReduce-Search-2i-Comparison.html) :
&gt;
&gt; Poor Use Case:
&gt;
&gt; Searching for common (low cardinality) terms in documents
&gt;
&gt; I agree that searching for common terms in Riak Search is a really poor use
&gt; case (and not only in RS), but shouldn't we speak about "high cardinality" ?
&gt;
&gt; As far as I know, cardinality is a mathematical concept that defines the
&gt; "size" of a set. Did I misunderstand it ?
&gt;
&gt; By the way, what is a "great cardinality" according to Riak Search ? 10 ?
&gt; 100 ? 1000 ? ...
&gt;

In database terms it's not the SIZE so much as the count of distinct
values. Does that help? As far as "great cardinality", I have no idea
off hand what that would be.
