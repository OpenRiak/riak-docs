I tried Firefox 9, Safari 5, and the latest Chrome. I would hardly consider 
these old browsers.

This is very much the behavior of older browsers not loading the CSS properly 
and displaying it. IE7, old versions of FireFox, etc. Have you tried Chrome, 
Safari, a latest FireFox, IE8+, etc?

&gt; I recently installed a Riak (1.1.1) Cluster on Rackspace Cloud Servers. 
&gt; Everything seems to be working ok.

&gt; I set up the configuration to enable Riak Control. However, I am having a few

&gt; 
&gt; As soon as I login in it shows me the home page briefly and then it just

&gt; Your cluster is healthy.
&gt; You currently have...

&gt; 0 Nodes experiencing low memory
&gt; Nothing to worry about because Riak is your friend
&gt; Your cluster has problems.
&gt; The following nodes are currently unreachable:
&gt; The following nodes are currently marked as 'down':

&gt; 
&gt; The URL has also changed from https://:8069/admin/ui/index.html to 
&gt; https://:8069/admin/ui/templates/snapshot.pjax. It's like it's forcing 
&gt; some kind of redirection and I don't know why.
