Riak Recap for Jan 19 - 20

1) The team at Nodejitsu just released Winston, a multi-transport
logging library for node.js. What's Winston's best feature: it
supports logging to a Riak server using Riak-js.

\\* GitHub Repo ---&gt; https://github.com/indexzero/winston
\\* Blog post from the Nodejitsu team ---&gt;

2) Alexander Sicular is doing an all-encompassing NoSQL talk for the
NYC Cloud Computing Group on February 9th and is planning to address
Riak (and several other databases that shall not be named).

\\* Details and registration here ---&gt;

3) @FrancescoC (Francesco Cesarini) tweeted a teaser to a forthcoming
book called "The Architecture of Open Source Applications." This will
include a chapter on Erlang coauthored by Francesco, Justin Sheehy,
and Andy Gross that will cover Riak in much detail.

4) We added a YAML Importer to Riak Function Contrib, courtesy of
Jeremiah Peschka.

\\* Check it out here ---&gt; http://contrib.basho.com/yaml\\_importer.html

Thanks, Jeremiah!

5) echosystm, aphyr and jdmaturen had a chat in #riak about
replication in Riak and how it handles the "split brain" problem.

6) Bryan O'Sullivan tweeted about some new Haskell bindings to Riak
that he put together. (As far as I can tell, the code hasn't been made
public anywhere... )
