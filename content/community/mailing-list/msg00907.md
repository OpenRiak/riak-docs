I would not allow your nodes to be accessible on the Internet. Nodes 
are all the same. Any node can answer any query. Put them behind a 
balancer like nginx and have that run through the list of all your 
nodes.

I've just glanced over the riak design overview and I think I am 
missing something basic in the failover technique. The docs explain 
that any node can process any query and that adding nodes will re- 
balance the storage. My question is, how does the client know which 
server node to contact initially and what happens if that node is 
the one that has failed - particularly for the rest interface where 
you don't have a special client? Do you typically put server nodes 
on the same host as the clients so they can use a localhost 
connection, use round robin DNS, put them behind a load balancer or 
is there some unique way of handling this?
