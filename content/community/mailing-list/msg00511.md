Hi,

As a learning exercise, I did a little experiment where I attempted to 
port some MapReduce queries from the nifty browser-based "Interactive 
CouchDB" demo (aka. jscouch) over to Riak. You can play with the 
original demo here:

For my port, I used Riak's JavaScript/jQuery client.

I thought it turned out OK, so I tossed it up here:

It might be interesting to somebody else that's just learning.

I'm also interested in any critique on how I constructed the queries, 
since I hardly know what I'm doing. :-)


Cheers,

 - Jim
