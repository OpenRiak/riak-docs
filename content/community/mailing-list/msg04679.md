el&gt; Please correct me if I am wrong, but after
el&gt; reading the documentation and looking at a test system, it appears
el&gt; that by default Riak will store data from different buckets within
el&gt; the same backend. That it merely treats the bucket as a prefix to
el&gt; the key and as a index to the per bucket configuration data.

Correct.

el&gt; Looking at the multiple backend example config at
el&gt; [1]https://help.basho.com/entries/20186031-how-can-i-run-bitcask-and
el&gt; -innostore-on-the-same-cluster it would appear that even if one
el&gt; enables multi backend support one only gains the ability to select
el&gt; different backend types, not different backend instances of the same
el&gt; type storing to different locations.

Correct.

el&gt; Even then it would appear that such instances of the same backend
el&gt; type would have to be predefined in app.config rather than
el&gt; programmatic created using the bucket properties API.

Correct. That limitation can be removed by writing your own backend
implementation. (Hey, it's just software. :-)
