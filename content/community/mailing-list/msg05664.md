We don't yet test or build Riak for Fedora 16, but one of our engineers
attempted to install the Riak RPM on Fedora 16 and got errors involving the
UID/GID for the Riak user. The errors showed up as "permission denied"
errors when opening directories despite being shown to be the owner.

Fedora 16 moving forward will require UID's and GID's to be greater than
1000, so a bug has been filed
https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=1290against Riak, We will
make the changes in the next major release of Riak.
 In the meantime, if you would like to use the packages on Fedora 16
change the UID/GID of the riak user/group accordingly.
