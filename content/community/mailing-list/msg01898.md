I originally replied only to Jérôme by mistake... here's the original

I've converted them to PDF and uploaded to my S3 account. Enjoy!

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I am very new to Riak and I am reading what I can find on the web. I have
&gt; noticed two presentation available at:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/hemulen/introducing-riak
&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/seancribbs/schema-design-for-riak
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, when I tried to download them, I get a .KEY file, which is
&gt; Mac specific. I am on Vista 7. There does not seem to be any tools available
&gt; to convert these to PDF or PPT. OpenOffice (which is capable of opening many
&gt; many types of file) does not seem to be able to read .key files.
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible to get a PDF version of these? Or can they be made available
&gt; somewhere online? It would lower the barrier to entry for new-comers.
&gt;
&gt; My other question/remark is: there does not seem to be a downloadable
&gt; version of Riak for Windows. Is there a technical reason for this or is it a
&gt; 'religious' issue? I am not especially pro or against Windows, but not
&gt; providing a version for it amounts to alienating from a large part of the
&gt; community who might be interested in Riak. It is another barrier to entry
&gt; for the development of this technology.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
