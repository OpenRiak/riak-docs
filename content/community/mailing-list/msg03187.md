Riak m/r is a scan operation. Solr is an indexed operation. By definition an 
indexed operation will be faster than a scan operation. Just something to keep 
in mind. 

You also mention "search by field" but Riak is opaque to values so I will just 
assume your values are json (not to say that you can't operate on non json 
data). 
Basically you are going to run a map function that has your filter in it. And 
then pass those results to a reduce function that implements a sort. 

Your actual implementation will take advantage of features made available by 
the client you use. I mainly use the nodejs javascript client, riakjs, which 
has very good support for building m/r queries. 

I have two articles on my blog which may help you out.
