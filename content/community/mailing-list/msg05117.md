Hi Tim,

&gt; 2. Are there any known plans for a Riak cloud service? I know about Joyent,
&gt; but frankly I don't like their business model and can't see using them. Just
&gt; curious if there's anything in the works.
&gt;
&gt; Note: as a preemptive answe: I'm looking for a service which is 1. more
&gt; reasonably priced, 2. has an initial free tier and 3. automates the upgrades
&gt; and the linking/start-up process... so really, I'm looking for the MongoHQ
&gt; of Riak (https://mongohq.com/pricing).
&gt;

Some alternatives (at varying levels of maturity) would be:

\\* Canvas Hosting - http://canvashosting.com/solutions/riak/
\\* Dotcloud - https://www.dotcloud.com/ (as far as I know, Riak
support is still in alpha)

There is also riaknow.com, but I'm not sure when that service will be
online (probably worth emailing them).

Hope that helps.

Mark
