We've got a riak\\_core based application in production which currently has 83 
and which at one point had 85 nodes so the practical limit is definitely higher 
than 20. It would be nice to know of a real limit though...

&gt;&gt; Hi

&gt;&gt; I wonder does Riak cluster maintain fully connected Erlang network between
&gt;&gt; machines?
&gt;&gt; As far as I know Erlang node network has a practical limit of around 20
&gt;&gt; machines
&gt;&gt; Does this limit influence Riak?
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Sharas,
&gt; 
&gt; Erlang/Riak does indeed maintain a fully-connected network between
&gt; nodes. The limit is much higher than 20 nodes, however -- anecdotal
&gt; evidence suggests that 200+ nodes is not out of the question.
