The default for a bucket is to use quorum writes, but you should be able to
specify that you only want to write to one Riak node as a parameter to the
write. So you don't necessarily have to adjust the nval.


Does the client directive actually control the number of writes or just the 
number of acknowledgments it waits for (i.e. does the server side still attempt 
the writes configured for the bucket)?
