Simon,

I hacked together a script that can detect a majority of the problems you
might encounter with Merge Index.

https://gist.github.com/3250870

It's not a perfect script and has had undergone minimal testing by yours
truly. It does not detect inconsistencies between a segment and it's
corresponding offset file. Instructions for using it are in the comments
of the gist.
