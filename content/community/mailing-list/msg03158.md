Hi Evgeni,

You can specify "desc" after your field in the URL to sort in descending
order. (Or "asc" if you want to explicitly request an ascending sort.)

For example:

"http://hostname:8098/solr/bucket?q=query&sort=change\\_date desc"

Remember to URL encode the space.

Best,
Rusty

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I have used this one in search request( \\*sort=FIELDNAME\\* – Sort on the
&gt; specified field name. Default is “none”, which causes the results to be
&gt; sorted in descending order by score.) Assume the fieldname is a change\\_date.
&gt; I got the result and sorted by change\\_date ASC.
&gt; Howto DESC the resultSet?
