Hi Emmanuel,

Currently, the scoring is not customizable. We will definitely consider
custom scoring for a future release, but this will likely be a few releases
into the future. As always, this may change based on the feedback we
receive.

Best,
Rusty

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I wonder if there is a way to customize the weighting (aka. scoring)
&gt; scheme used by Riak Search to sort matching documents, as it is the
&gt; case with Xapian for instance (http://xapian.org/docs/sorting.html) or
&gt; even Lucene (Similarity class).
&gt; As I am not indexing textual documents, I am not interested in a
&gt; default probabilistic or VSM model. A basic weighted boolean model
&gt; should be much more appropriate.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
