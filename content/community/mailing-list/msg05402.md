I use it now but am thinking of moving away from it. Be aware that when you
first create an object via put/post, Riak returns "date" and not "last
modified".

For that reason but more importantly consuming data hosted in Riak via non
related applications/languages/projects I'm looking to keep dates as actual
values within the json value. Also data export reasons. Better fidelity and
granularity. Like keeping a created and last mod stamp or an array of every
time the object was modified.

Also level db has built in data smushing so it's almost free.

Cheerios,
Alexander

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; In the HTTP interface I'm seeing the "Last-Modified" header when
&gt; retrieving an
&gt; object. The value also appears in the python bindings under get\\_metadata()
&gt; ['lastmod'].
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for the really dumb question but I can I rely on this field to
&gt; always be
&gt; present and in this format? Can MapReduce operations read this value?
&gt;
&gt; I was about to put a timestamp field in my JSON blobs but then found this
&gt; and I
&gt; think I should use it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
