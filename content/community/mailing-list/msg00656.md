Greetings.

I noticed that the pictures that R generates from basho\\_bench results
have one inconvenient point.

All the graphs (at least, all I generated myself or saw in the
Internet) with separated requests latencies (i.e. second and third
lines) always have much free space at the top of the curves. At the
same time, small values like median and mean are often at the very
bottom of the graph so it's sometimes hard to say the approximate
value of the curve.
I don't know Rscript and ggplot at all so I'm not sure if zooming
extends is easy in that case. But anyway, this thing would be great.

Thank you.
