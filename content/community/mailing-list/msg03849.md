&gt; James, does the same thing happen with the 0.14.2 release? Â Earlier 0.14
&gt; releases used a sort that wasn't stable and so result ordering could be
&gt; (and frequently were) different.

We upgraded to 14.2, using the RPM for riak search, and are continuing
to see the following issue:

- the number of results found by a solr query to riak search is
 changing from one call to the next, even when run against
 the same server.

One thought I have is that the index got corrupted somehow.? and thus,
perhaps re-indexing the contents of the bucket I am searching would
fix the issue. I haven't been able to find any information on how to
accomplish that.

How would I re-index all the contents of a bucket?

Thanks,

James
