Always impressed when Google acknowledges another company, that's great! :-)

&gt; Evening, Morning, Afternoon to All -
&gt;
&gt; This Recap is coming to you live from about 25,000 feet above Northern
&gt; California courtesy of Alaska Air's Wifi. (15000ms ping times and 18%
&gt; packet loss can't stop the Recap.)
&gt;
&gt; Tons of good stuff to share today: new Ruby code, slide decks, blog
&gt; posts, and more.
&gt;
&gt; Enjoy.

&gt; Riak Recap for July 25 - 26
&gt; ====================
&gt;
&gt; 1) Sean Cribbs and the Ripple Team just released version 0.9.7 of the
&gt; riak-client and riak-sessions gems.
&gt;
&gt; \\* Details here ---&gt;

&gt;
&gt; 2) This made the List already but it's worth sending them along again:
&gt; Rusty's slides from the Secondary Indices talk he delivered at OSCON
&gt; on Monday are now available.

&gt; \\* Comment thread on Hacker News with a lot of great discussion and Q &
&gt; A ---&gt; http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2807968
&gt;
&gt; 3) Denish Patel (@DenishPatel), with the help of Brian Clapper
&gt; (@neophenix), wrote a great blog post about how easy it is to
&gt; configure and use Circonus to monitor your Riak cluster.

&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Denish and Brian!
&gt;
&gt; 4) Google wrote a quick blog post about their recently-released k/v
&gt; storage engine LevelDB. Diligent followers of Riak will recall that we
&gt; recently added support for LevelDB to Riak. This post has some
&gt; extensive benchmarks and also gives a shout out to...Riak :)

&gt; benchmarking page on the wiki.
