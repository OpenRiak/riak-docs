Hi, Jeremy.

If you build Riak from source, you'll end up with Riak using the
version of Erlang that you used to build it. With a pre-packaged
version, it will use the Erlang that was used to make the packages.

Riak will be moving to a newer Erlang in upcoming releases, by the way.

&gt; different Erlang install (say installed at /usr/local/lib/erlang)?
