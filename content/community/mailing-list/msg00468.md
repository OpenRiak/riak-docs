Riak Recap for 5/28 - 5/30


1) Q --- Anyone been playing around with riak and node.js? (from
indexzero via #riak)

A --- @frank06, @siculars, @botanicus, and @technoweenie would be the
best people to bug if you had any riak+node questions.

2) A few interesting projects came across the mailing list this past weekend.

Just to remind everyone, they are:

\\* http://github.com/frank06/devise-ripple
\\* http://www.redaelli.org/matteo-blog/projects/ebot/ (there was also
a brief write-up on this that appeared yesterday ---&gt;
http://www.linux-magazin.de/NEWS/Web-Crawler-Ebot-0.3-spricht-mit-Datenbank-Riak)

They have both been added to the Riak wiki here ---&gt;

3) Untoad Toad, a request handler collection exception information
into the Riak storage, appeared over the weekend. (h/t to Oruen for
releasing this).

 More info here ---&gt; http://github.com/oruen/untoad\\_toad

4) Riak got a nice shout out from the father of Erlang himself, Joe
Armstrong, in his recent Qcon talk. It happens right around the 45
minute mark (but the entire talk is definitely worthwhile).
