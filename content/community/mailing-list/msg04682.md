matt, 

I am using client.search() would the other method be better?

Here is a snippet of the code.

def search( self, bu, query ): 
 
 if not self.bucket[bu].search\\_enabled():
 self.bucket[bu].enable\\_search()
 
 query = self.client.search(bu , query).run()
 
 data = '' 
 
 for r in query:
 
 s = r.get().get\\_data()
 
 data += s['post']

 return data

It fails when trying to append data with a "nonetype" object, ive tried it
serveral other ways in the code itself, i always get the same result. 

last night i boiled it down to get() returing a riakobject but get\\_data() is
returning None.

init() on the riakobject sets self.\\_data = None. alls get\\_data() does is
return self.\\_data. Somewhere along the line i assume the RiakObject is
supposed to populate the data but it doesnt seem to be happening.
