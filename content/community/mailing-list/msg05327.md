Riak 1.0 introduced two reduce phase tuning
parameters: reduce\\_phase\\_batch\\_size and reduce\\_phase\\_only\\_1. Both of these
can be specified on a per phase basis using the arg parameter, passing them
in as a map. This appears to overload the arg parameter, which was already
being used to pass static arguments to the phase functions.

Is there some mechanism to pass both a static function argument, say to the
built-in Riak.reduceSort, while at the same time passing one of the new
tuning parameters?
