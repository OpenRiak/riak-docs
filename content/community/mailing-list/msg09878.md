Hello,

I was checking the Bitcask Capacity Calculator when I noticed the overhead
used for a bucket/key pair was 43 and not 22 bytes as specified.

After checking the JS that do the calculus, I noticed the bucket/key pair
is 35+sizeof\\_PTR. I don't know what PTR is, but the value by default is 8.

Does anyone knows the actual formula to get the RAM usage with Bitcask ?

Simon
