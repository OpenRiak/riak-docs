Hi All,

One update to send along here: there is a known issue with LevelDB
performance [1] when going from 1.0 and 1.1 to 1.2 that didn't make
it into the release notes. As is the case with all known issues, we're
working on a fix and will keep you posted.

Mark

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; At long last, we are thrilled to announced that Riak 1.2 has
&gt; officially been released and is available for download. We've already
&gt; posted various blog posts and mailing list emails about what's in 1.2,
&gt; so I'll be brief. This is a significant release packed with tons of
&gt; bug fixes (almost 40 by my count), enhacncements, and new features. It
&gt; should go without saying, but it wouldn't have happened without the
&gt; community. Thanks for helping us get here!
