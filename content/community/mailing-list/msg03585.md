Jared -

Thanks! I ran 'make rel', and got several errors like this:

fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

The entire output is at https://gist.github.com/1011164.

!!! However, the good news is that the build apparently succeeded, and the bug 
I reported before is no longer there!!!

&gt; You can build for OSX using the source tarball for 0.14.2. There are plans 
&gt; in the future to create packages for OSX once again. It is currently 
&gt; planned for our next major release.

&gt; In case it helps, the problem manifested on riak 0.14.0 on Mac OS but not on 
&gt; an Ubuntu VM.
&gt; 
&gt; The most recent version available for download at 
&gt; http://downloads.basho.com/riak/CURRENT/ for Mac OS was 0.14.0, so that's 
&gt; what I'm using. I realize that would have been helpful information I could 
&gt; have provided before, and apologize for not mentioning it -- I forgot that I 
&gt; had to use an earlier version to run it on the Mac. Are there any plans to 
&gt; provide more recent versions for the Mac? Or can I build from one of the 
&gt; other packages?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, Is there a way within Riak::Client or somewhere else in the ruby riak 
&gt; client gem or riak executables or config files to get the server version 
&gt; number and possibly OS information? I do see this:
&gt; 
&gt; { % }: ls -1 releases 
&gt; 
&gt; 6.Jun.11 12.18
&gt; 0.14.0
&gt; start\\_erl.data
&gt; 
&gt; ...is this the best way?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Keith

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for your responses. I'm trying to wrap my head around the issues 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you raised, and I must confess it's difficult. Anyway, some questions 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for you...

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Riak can't use the vclock for conflict resolution on a fresh object,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i.e. one without a vclock. Deletes are writes. You should use get or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reload before writing to help Riak sequence your writes correctly.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If the caller doesn't have a handle to the RObject in the Ruby framework, 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or the metadata of an HTTP response, but is only accessing the data by 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bucket and key values, is there any way to use reload? And if the object 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; has been deleted is there any way to use get?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On top of this, Riak has some weirdness around very quick sequences
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of deletes/writes due, IIRC, to deletes not being tagged with a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vector clock. I... think... this will be addressed in an upcoming
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; release.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I tried inserting a 20 second pause between each read/write, but there 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; was no change in the behavior. Should it be longer than that?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; This is scary, it should not be possible to trigger this behaviour with
&gt; &gt;&gt; such a large gap. Even 10ms was enough to prevent it in my testing.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, my favorite bug. This is indeed mostly solved on master by exposing
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the vclocks for tombstones so they can be cleanly overwritten by the new
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; object rather than merged into a frankenobject that has the metadata of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the tombstone but the value of the new object (which is then subject to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; real deletion).
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So the fix for the issue was to add a new type of return value for a get
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that finds a tombstone, {error, {deleted, Vclock}} instead of always
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; returning {error, notfound} on a true notfound or when a tombstone is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encountered.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That sounds like exactly what I need. Can I simulate that fix in my Ruby 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; code? Any pointers about that? Any chance we could get that into the 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ruby client? I'd be willing to put a little effort into that, but I 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; don't really understand the issues well enough yet.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I suspect we will want to update the clients to support this, but I
&gt; &gt;&gt; don't know of a specific plan to do so yet. I don't know the details of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the ruby client enough (or at all) to advise on making changes to it.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An example of how to safely delete for all 3 APIs can be found at
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://gist.github.com/965376
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Note the new deletedvclock option. The REST API will always use this
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option on gets and will return a X-Riak-Vclock header along with any 404
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is actually a tombstone.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some further reading can be found here:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=260
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=555
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, long story short; either upgrade to master and use the deletedvclock
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; option or avoid doing rapid put/delete/put cycles.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You're suggesting I use mercurial to pull down the HEAD and use that, 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; right?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; git, not mercurial. I don't think we maintain the bitbucket repos
&gt; &gt;&gt; anymore, everything has moved to github.
