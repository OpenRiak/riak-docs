This is a situation similar to one I had in mind when I wrote the Riak -&gt; 
RabbitMQ integration. Think of it as a distributed database trigger. It is a 
post-commit hook, as Russell mentions being the way to achieve what you're 
looking for, but this post-commit hooks sends out an AMQP message telling 
subscribers about new data coming into Riak.

&gt; Subject: Listen to Put Event in Riak

&gt; Hi

&gt; I have Riak servers A, B and C.
&gt; As I know, assume I put my data into Riak server A via HTTP
&gt; interface,
&gt; I will hashed and determined to be stored in some other servers. May
&gt; be finally stored into B and C.

&gt; What I want is listen to the upload event.
&gt; And one and only one of them A, B, C kick off some external process.

&gt; Any API for that ?
&gt; Or I should have watching processes in all A, B, C servers (will have
&gt; race condition and locking problem)?

&gt; Sorry, I am new to Riak. I may miss some important components.
&gt; Please point that out to me.

&gt; Thanks

&gt; -- Best Regards,
&gt; Eric Fong
