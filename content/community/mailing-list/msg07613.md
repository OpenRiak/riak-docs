Hi ,

Is there any way to add bucket level authentication in riak ?

suppose i have two buckets \\*bucket1\\* and \\*bucket2 \\*under same riak cluster
. I want to access bucket1 using authentication ( privately) and buckets2
publicly . Is it possible ?
If yes then how to do this and if no then is there any alternative to do
this .

thanks ,
Sohil Raghwani
