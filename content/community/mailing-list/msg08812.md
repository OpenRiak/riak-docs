Hi,

I booted up a two node cluster.

I got to riak control and I see that one node has 100% of the
partions. I see both nodes in riak control.

I am using 1.2.

How do I resolve?

Below is my code on how I join

 cmd = 'riak-admin cluster join riak@%s' % existing\\_riak[0]
 cmd = 'riak-admin cluster plan'
 cmd = 'riak-admin cluster commit'
 cmd = 'service riak start'
 cmd = 'riak-admin status | grep ring\\_members'

Thanks
