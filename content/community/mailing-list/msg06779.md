Hello,
Not sure if this is the right forum to post this, but i am hoping you can help.
I have a livestats nodejs tracking site, code for it is here:

https://github.com/nkhine/livestats

which is based on the peepcode screencast, with some updates.

i am planning to extend the
https://github.com/nkhine/livestats/blob/master/lib/livestats.js to
include the riak-js library so as to store the data, something like:

var db = require('riak-js').getClient({host: "riak.myhost", port: "8098" });
db.save('user', 'lat', 'lon', 'city', 'timestamp'});

but, i was wondering how to implement a page refresh and for the map
to load all entries within a set period of elapsed time. and place the
entries within the map.

any pointers much appreciated.
