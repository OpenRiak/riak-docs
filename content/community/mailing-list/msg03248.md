I was curious if anyone has any thoughts on what is more performant, links
or key filters in terms of secondary links. For example:

I want to be able to look up a user by id and email:

\\*Link implementation:\\*

Two buckets: user and user\\_email, where id is the key of user and email is
the key of user\\_email. User\\_email contains no data but simply has a link
pointing back to the proper user.

\\*Key Filter:\\*

One bucket: user, where id\\_email is the key of the bucket. Lookups would
use a key filter tokenizing the id and then looking up the id or email based
on the proper token.

Obviously both work, but I'm curious what the implications are from a
performance standpoint.

Thanks,

Andrew
