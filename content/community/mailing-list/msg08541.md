Hi Reid,
thanks for that - I'll read up on those links.

thanks again,
Pat.

Pat,
Adding to what Sean said, Riak also offers some more fine-grained controls 
around whenreplicas return 'notfound'. In your case, using `{notfound\\_ok, 
false}` and `{basic\\_quorum, false}`might help as well. You can see them 
documented more here [1]. Unfortunately the Pythonclient doesn't support these 
features at the per request level at the moment. If you'd like though,you could 
simply set them as bucket properties with curl. You'll find examples of setting 
bucketproperties here [2].

Does your test use retries when it gets "not found" responses? You
might not encounter that small % of missing keys if you retry at least
once when they are missing. Because of the eventually consistent
design of Riak, writes you make might not be readable immediately.

Hi all,
I was just wondering if you could give me some feedback on my usage of RIAK.
I'm currently testing a number of datastores and am trying to come up with
pros/ cons of each.

I have a variety of tests (write speed 1 client, write speed 10 clients,
read speed 1 client, read speed 10 clients, read while writing, write while
reading etc). The data set is tiny for this phase (10k, 50k, 100k).

I have 3 machines in the cluster (each with 12GB RAM, quadcore CPUs, 500GB
drives), each cache setup to use 128MB memory (eleveldb). Each key is 64
bytes. and each value is 512 bytes.


The write speed I'm getting is around 260.0440791 per second (using 1
client), scaling to 2281.1662 writes per second (using 10 clients).
The read speed I'm getting is around 397.2291042 per second (using 1
client), scaling to 3316.089445 reads per second (using 10 clients).

One very worrying thing I noticed is that I sometimes miss keys? i.e. I
write 100k keys to disk, then read them all back in and check the value
matches expected. This would only happen for 1 or 2 keys out of 100k, but
(1 or 2 keys is enoughâ€¦)

This is using the latest version of RIAK with the python client (python
client is running on a 4th machine).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,
Pat.
