Hey Mattias,

 Thanks a lot for your quick response, the link you have given as good
information. But, what if I use normal queries for ex: I do User.find("
matt...@gmail.com") or something like that then if the node that is setup
on the ripple.yml is down then it cant information from other nodes and it
became quite a problem to handle/fix this issue.

Regards,
Vamsi.

&gt; there's nothing wrong with your cluster setup. Support for multiple nodes
&gt; in Ripple is being worked on in the master branch, you can have a lookie
&gt; here at the documentation update on how to use it:
&gt; https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/commit/88fed2bdb1900ccc26fd292b3607d66cbcbe82c4

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was able to set up a riak cluster with 4 nodes. I am using ripple as
&gt; an orm for riak db, but I can only configure with one node. I am getting
&gt; data replicated in other nodes but, the issue is if the configured node
&gt; with ripple is down I was not able to make use of the other nodes. Is there
&gt; a way that I can configure ripple with all those nodes? Or can is there
&gt; something wrong with the cluster setup ? I followed wiki.basho.com (
&gt; http://wiki.basho.com) for the cluster setup.
