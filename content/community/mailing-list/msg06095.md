Hi Jordan,

&gt; I am working on bindings for the HTTP API for lisp, the docs list new and

&gt; supporting all of the new URL formats?

Looks like you've caught an error in the wiki. The new URL formats are
supported, but we neglected to provide the full URL in the docs. You
are missing a "/keys" from the end of those URLs. The URLs in line
below should work for you.

I'll push a fix to the wiki today if I have a few minutes. Sorry for
the confusion. Also, quite excited to see lisp bindings. :)

&gt; These don't seem to be working with the new URL format:

&gt; Get bucket:
&gt; curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test
&gt;

curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test/keys

&gt; Set bucket:
&gt; curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \\
&gt; '{"props":{"n\\_val":5}}' http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test
&gt;

curl -v -d 'this is a test' -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \\
http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test/keys


&gt; Store object:
&gt; curl -v -d 'this is a test' -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \\
&gt; http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test
&gt;

curl -v -d 'this is a test' -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \\
