Alright, so when creating your own coordinators, it's probably best to 
use the supervisor until you see it as a bottleneck. Correct?

Hey everyone,

I'm currently using riak\\_kv as a reference of how to implement riak\\_core and 
see that whenever a new coordinator process is needed, a new one is created via 
their supervisor. But in the case of the get and put coordinators, the 
supervisor is not used.

Besides eliminating the supervisor as a potential bottleneck, is there any 
reason why the supervisor is not used?

AFAIK it is only that (eliminating a potential bottleneck.) It is an 
optimisation added to the kv code in the last few weeks.

Cheers
