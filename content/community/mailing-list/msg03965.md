Thanks Sean.

I did what you suggested. Pulled and built a new rebar. Copied that into
/usr/local/bin. Checked that it would take precedence over the one that is
packaged in the RIAK repo.

The one in the root of RIAK is "rebar version: 2 date 20110310\\_184739
2e1b4da". The newly built one is: "rebar version: 20110708\\_181908 vcs: git
5e04e7d"

Unfortunately, the makefile in the root of RIAK explicitly calls the
pre-packaged rebar. I get the same build errors.

So I replaced the prepackaged rebar with the newly built one ... and a clean
build works fine with no makefile changes required.

&gt; This is a question best sent to the riak-users list. Recent changes in the
&gt; codebase necessitate an upgrade to rebar. In your source checkout, download
&gt; rebar from here: https://github.com/downloads/basho/rebar/rebar ... then
&gt; re-attempt the build.

&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Environment = CentOS 64bit 5.6
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've got working 13B04 (from source) + .14.2 ... no problems there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've got a working 14B02 (from source) ... no problems there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've cloned RIAK from github today. Have two problems while building:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; erlang\\_js ... need to modify Makefile to explicitly set --enable-64bit
&gt;&gt; eleveldb ... need to modify leveldb/Makefile to explicitly set -fPIC
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; NOTE: When I pull the individual repos directly, they build fine. It's
&gt;&gt; only when pulling RIAK and rebar has done the get\\_deps process that I've got
&gt;&gt; the problem.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It seems that there are commits in either of the dependent repositories
&gt;&gt; for these fixes.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I just don't know how rebar does it's dependency magic (yet) to understand
&gt;&gt; what commit it's pulling from github.
