Do you embed PostgreSQL or Oracle in your application? Generally you don't
(sqlite3 aside). This is the same concept. Depend on the client library,
not the database.

&gt; This is the answer I hoped not to read. You might call it a premature

&gt; distributed Erlang app with Riak as a dependency.
&gt;
&gt; I've been hacking on a Riak fork that twiddles the rebar and reltool
&gt; configs to shoehorn my own code into the same VM. That part is awkward
&gt; but not impossible.
&gt;
&gt; I was hoping you'd say Basho was working on an easy way to include
&gt; Riak as a rebar dep without forking as I did.

&gt; &gt;&gt; 4. Does it make more sense to just install a riak package and use the
&gt; &gt;&gt; erlang pb client? Seems like it would be less efficient especially
&gt; since
&gt; &gt;&gt; these will live on the same machine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is the preferred way to attack this problem. Separation of the
&gt; &gt; functionality by O/S processes is appropriate and much easier to
&gt; &gt; reason about in error situations. Loopback sockets to the PBs
&gt; &gt; interface should be within a 1 ms of total request handling time.
