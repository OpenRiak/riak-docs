Addendum!

I managed to overlook this convo about exact phrase searching and stemming with 
Riak Search: https://gist.github.com/866910

(h/t to Scott Gonyea for bringing it to my attention)

&gt; For today's Recap: A new Meetup in Stockholm, videos, jobs, some great

&gt; Riak Recap for March 9 - 10
&gt; 
&gt; 1) There is a new regularly-scheduled Riak Meetup starting! This one
&gt; will be in Stockholm, and is being organized by MÃ¥rten Gustafson
&gt; (@martengustafson) and several other developers in the Stockholm area.
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Details and registration here ---&gt;
&gt; http://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Riak-Meetup/
&gt; \\* This has also been added to the list of Meetups on the Riak Wiki
&gt; ---&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/The-Riak-Community.html#Meetups (As you'll
&gt; notice, there is plenty of room for more Meetups to be added...)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, big thanks to the leadership team -
&gt; http://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Riak-Meetup/members/?op=leaders - for
&gt; getting this off the ground!
&gt; 
&gt; 2) InfoQ posted a video of Andy Gross' "Riak Core: Dynamo Building
&gt; Blocks" presentation from last year's QCon event in San Francisco.
&gt; This is a great talk, and if you haven't had a chance to dig into
&gt; riak\\_core, I highly recommend you do so.

&gt; 
&gt; 3) Wikia is hiring Operations Engineers in the San Francisco area with
&gt; Riak experience.
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Details here ---&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 4) seancribbs and Spyplane had a brief discussion in #riak about the
&gt; feasibility of using Riak and/or Riak Search for a use case requiring
&gt; indexing.
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/866691
&gt; 
&gt; 5) Q --- When retrieving a list of siblings via the REST interface, I
&gt; am getting the same vtag appearing multiple times. Is this normal? I
&gt; thought the vtags were unique? Are they referring to the same sibling?
&gt; (from thebird via #riak)
&gt; 
&gt; A --- The vtag is calculated on a PUT based on the vclock and is
&gt; stored as part of the object's meta data. It would be possible to get
&gt; siblings with the same vtag when vector clock pruning or read/reapair
&gt; was happening.
&gt; 
&gt; 6) We added a page to the Wiki for both Riak and Riak Search release notes.
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Check it out here ---&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/Release-Notes.html
&gt; 
&gt; (h/t to Scott Gonyea for putting this together.)
&gt; 
&gt; 7) MailRank's Haskell client got a bump to version 0.3.0.2 yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Test drive it here if you haven't already ---&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/mailrank/riak-haskell-client
&gt; 
&gt; 8) atoi and seancribbs had a brief chat in #riak that started with,
&gt; "Any thoughts on Riak for stats for an ecommerce website?"
