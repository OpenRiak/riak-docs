&gt;&gt; Hey All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As promised, here is the blog post on Riak Search.

&gt; Nice. Thanks for the update Mark.
&gt; It sounds like you're using Java in places (e.g., Lucene analyzers). Is that
&gt; assumption correct? I saw John mention work of an Erlang NIF to run an
&gt; embedded JVM. Probably unrelated but one has to wonder.
