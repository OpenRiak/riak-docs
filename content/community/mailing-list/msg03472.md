With enough RAM you could just have it keep the whole thing in disk-cache...

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible to store the whole database in memory?
&gt; In a similar way as Redis does.
&gt;
&gt; I'm really interested in the distributed map reduce done by riak ("bring
&gt; processing to the data, instead of data to processors), but I need faster
&gt; writes/reads that a memory-only database could provide.
&gt; In case you don't support memory-only storage (no disk touched / all keys
&gt; and data fitting the memory in all nodes) yet, do you plan on implementing
&gt; it?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Michael
