What about caching with redis? That seems to be a popular option as well.

&gt;&gt; I'm considering Riak for the statistics of a site that is approaching
&gt;&gt; a billion page views per month. The plan is to log a little
&gt;&gt; information about each the page view and then to query that data.

&gt; Honestly, I wouldn't use stock Riak for this; the MR times will become
&gt; prohibitive over billions of records. However, jrecursive has been solving
&gt; a very similar set of problems at Showyou, and wrote Mecha, a solr/leveldb
&gt; backend for Riak. Mecha provides fast, distributed querying on top of
&gt; Riak's redundancy/distribution. There's a talk at the next Riak Meetup on
&gt; the 23rd, and we should be releasing then as well.
