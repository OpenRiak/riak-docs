Hi guys,

I'm using lager and riak\\_err on one of my projects.
Some errors appears during the startup as reported by lager (see below):

&lt;0.48.0&gt;: riak\\_err\\_monitor: handler riak\\_err\\_handler exited for reason normal
21:59:24.077 [error] gen\\_server riak\\_err\\_monitor terminated with reason: 
gen\\_event\\_EXIT
21:59:24.081 [error] CRASH REPORT Process riak\\_err\\_monitor with 0 neighbours 
crashed with reason: 
{gen\\_event\\_EXIT,[{gen\\_server,terminate,6,[{file,"gen\\_server.erl"},{line,737}]},{proc\\_lib,init\\_p\\_do\\_apply,3,[{file,"proc\\_lib.erl"},{line,227}]}]}
21:59:24.142 [error] Supervisor riak\\_err\\_sup had child riak\\_err\\_monitor started 
with riak\\_err\\_monitor:start\\_link() at &lt;0.48.0&gt; exit with reason gen\\_event\\_EXIT 
in context child\\_terminated

Of course, the supervisor restart the crashed process and everything is fine 
after that.
But i would like to understand why?

My box: Erlang R14B04, OSX 10.6.8

Happy New Year !!

Regards,
Zabrane
