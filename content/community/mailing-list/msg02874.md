Hey Jon,

A webcast (or better yet a series of webcasts) on riak\\_core is a great
idea, and something we've been talking about producing. Guess we'll
just have to move a bit faster :) The first one will probably be an
overview of how to build a simple app with riak\\_core.

Time permitting, we'll try and get some more content out there around
core. What else would you like to see?

&gt; Pouring over the BashoBanjo app to trick and figure it out. But still need

&gt; Thanks!
