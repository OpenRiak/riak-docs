I don't have any exact statistics, but I'm willing to personally guarantee
you will not be disappointed. Both Riak back ends are essentially doing
random IO, and in practice we've found our disks to be entirely bounded by
seek time.

&gt; Hello All.
&gt; We currently have a large number of DL 380 HPs with 8 SAS disks in
&gt; a raid 10 for our Riak cluster. One of the ways in which we were
&gt; considering increasing performance is to move the Riak files off to SSD.
&gt; Has anyone on the list moved to SSDs? Have you any statistics on
&gt; performance gains?
&gt;
&gt; I've had a look through the mailing list archives and can see no
&gt; mention of it. Which brings me to another point, are the archives
&gt; searchable anywhere? I had to go through month my month topic listings.
