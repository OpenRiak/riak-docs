Noooooooooooo.

&gt; There's also a StreamingListKeys operation that is somewhat less blocking
&gt; that a straight up ListKeys.

&gt; Agreed that I would not try this in production. If possible I would still
&gt; like to see if CI has a way to do this before I go and implement a custom
&gt; web request to do this.

&gt; I would like to get a list of all the keys in a particular bucket. I would
&gt; prefer the answer come in the form of a CorrugatedIron sample but a general
&gt; REST call would also be helpful. Is this possible? Thank you.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is well-documented in our docs [0]. Please note that this is
&gt;
&gt; \\*not\\* recommended for production use (as the page states). I took a
&gt;
&gt; quick look at the CorrugatedIron docs [1] and didn't find any details
&gt;
&gt; on how to do this which means that either a) I missed it or b) OJ and
&gt;
&gt; Jeremiah saved you a lot of production pain by not implementing it. :)
