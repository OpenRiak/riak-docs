Manipulating the vclock client side in theory could be used to affect what
data is stored. I wouldnt say this is a large problem but I would think
about whats being stored and if being able to say force a revert is
profitable.

&gt; A web app that we're building is designed in such a way that the vector

&gt; requests so that we can keep track of state conflicts in riak.

&gt; My question is: are there any security risks in doing this? We've
&gt; obfuscated the vector clock (and never call it the vector clock on the
&gt; client side), but that's just security through obscurity, and probably
&gt; wouldn't hold up very long. Would a client be able to get any meaninful
&gt; information out of a vector clock, or manipulate it in such a way that when
&gt; they return it it could harm the database? Are there any ways we could
&gt; combat this?
