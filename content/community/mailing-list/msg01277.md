I want to make sure my understanding is correct.

riak-search is a super set of riak. as such, any existing riak client
lib (the java one for example),
can "PUT" data into riak-search.

but only PHP, Python, Ruby, and Erlang riak client can execute a
"search" from within the client
lib.

However, you can always just perform the search using HTTP REST right?

We use the java client most of the time for data injection.
