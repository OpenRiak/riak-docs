Hey James,

Is the http://basho.github.com/riak-python-client/ what you're trying to
use? What are the problems you're getting when you're trying to compile?

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt;
&gt; Anyone using Appfog to connect to riak using python?
&gt;
&gt; I am having problems with compilation protobuf when it tried to install
&gt; the python client.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway around this apart from using HTTP directly via urllib / etc ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
