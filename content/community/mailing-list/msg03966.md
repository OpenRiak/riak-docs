Riak Recap for July 6 - 7
==================

1) Bryan O'Sullivan's Haskell Client just hit version 0.6.

\\* Details here ---&gt; http://twitter.com/#!/Hackage/status/88761152116490242

2) This one is somewhat far out on the calendar but it's worth
relaying: newly-minted Basho Architect Steve Vinoksi will be talking
at GOTO Amsterdam in October.

\\* Details here ---&gt; http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2011/speaker/Steve+Vinoski

3) Luca Spiller released "Riak Console," an interactive command line
interface to Riak. This one looks pretty useful

\\* On GitHub here ---&gt; https://github.com/lucaspiller/riak-console

Thanks, Luca!

4) Next week at BashoWest we will be having a Ripple Hackathon, and
we're opening up the office to Bay Area Ruby Hackers. You should be
here.

\\* Details here on the Basho Blog ---&gt;

5) Alexander Mikhalev (@alex\\_mikhalev) wrote a blog post about
securing a Riak cluster using n2n VPN. This one is definitely worth
the read. (NOTE: The typical recommended configuration is behind a
firewall where the cluster is not exposed to the outside world.)

Thanks, Alexander! 

6) One job to pass along.
