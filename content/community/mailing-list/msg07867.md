When I pass (using PBC API) a w n\\_val of 4294967294 (4294967295 - 1) to tell 
riak to only require 1 replica to respond successful for a write I get back 
error code 1 {n\\_val\\_violation,3}.

However, if I pass in the integer value 1 instead of the special value it 
works. Did I misunderstand the meaning of this?

I get the same error actually for all of the special numbers.
