Ya, I do it all the time. Pass specific bucket/key pairs to the m/r
input. My apps use redis to store/get keys which I then pass to the
m/r.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; A while ago, this issue was opened to track supporting multi\\_get
&gt;
&gt; https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=96
&gt;
&gt; ie, in a single HTTP get request, you pass a list of 20 keys, riak returns
&gt; all
&gt; 20 values in a single response.
&gt;
&gt; I didn't see any movement on that.
&gt;
&gt; so is there a way to "fake" it using map reduce?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
