I've followed the directions verbatim for setting up basho bench. I 
successfully ran a test, but now I get the following error when running "make 
results"

root@basho-bench:~/basho\\_bench# make results
priv/summary.r -i tests/current
/usr/bin/env: Rscript --vanilla: No such file or directory
make: \\*\\*\\* [results] Error 127

I also tried:

root@basho-bench:~/basho\\_bench# priv/summary.r -i tests/current
/usr/bin/env: Rscript --vanilla: No such file or directory

These were tried on a clean linode machine using erlang latest and apt-get 
install r-base and r-base-dev. 

Can anyone offer any assistance here? Obviously the #!/usr/bin/env Rscript 
--vanilla statement is causing some problems. Rscript is correctly in path.

Thanks!
