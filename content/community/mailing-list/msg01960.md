The answer is no. Riak security is defined by you, the user, setting 
up appropriate network access to the riak service. This is done 
primarily by routers, firewalls and proxies.

Hi,

Newbie question. I am trying to find documentation about Riak 
security. I have seen http://wiki.basho.com/Network-Security-and-Firewall-Configurations.html
, but I could not find much on access control.


Is it possible to secure access to Riak nodes? Does it offer 
something similar to http://srp.stanford.edu/ (i.e. remote login)?


I read somewhere that Riak does not use encryption for exchange 
between nodes. Is this (still) correct? What about communication 
with users applications?


If the answer to the above question is no, then how can one secure a 
Riak system properly?


Thanks,

Jérôme
