Hi all,

I hope this is the right place to ask this.

I have been playing with the riak-java-client via clojure which has
been great.

However I cant find a way to pass static args using MapReduceBuilder.
My javascript map function is like this;

function(value, keyData, arg){
 if (some\\_predicate(value, arg)){
 return munged(value);
 }
 return [];
}

I am trying to workout how to pass the "arg".

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

regards, Simon Cusack.
