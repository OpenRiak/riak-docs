&gt; Hi Seth,

&gt; That option is supported by OS X however it is only enabled if COMMAND\\_MODE 
&gt; is set as unix2003. This is set by default in Apple's Terminal application 
&gt; but not in iTerm:

That's quite interesting. I still think it makes sense to apply a
small patch since there is nothing essential that -f is doing for this
purpose and OS X and iTerm are not an uncommon dev environment. I've
been using that combo for a number of years and this is the first I've
heard of COMMAND\\_MODE (maybe I'm doing it all wrong :-P ).

Cheers,

+ seth
