What are your w and dw values set to? What backend are you using?

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; I'm attempting to importing 300M+ objects into a Riak cluster, but have
&gt; quickly reached the REST API's speed-limit at 200-store()'s per second..
&gt; At the rate of 200/s, I'm looking at 20-days to import this data set! That
&gt; can't be the fastest method to do this..
&gt;
&gt; Any recommendations?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
