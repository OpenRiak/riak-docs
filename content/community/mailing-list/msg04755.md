Hi Vicky,

What client are you using? The protocol buffer API is generally way faster than 
using clients that are using the HTTP interface. Also, have you tried using 
multiple threads for deletion? That might give you a speed boost. The speed in 
riak lies partially in the fact that it is very concurrent. Also, try to spread 
the deletions over multiple physical nodes (if you have multiple nodes, that 
is).

As to renaming a bucket, I haven't heard of it. But then again, I'm not a pro.

Good luck!

Regards,
Jens

Ämne: Rename riak bucket ; low speed on deletion.

Hi,

Can we by any chance rename riak bucket??
Also Deletion all keys in a bucket is taking a lot of time:
30 secs for 10000 records which means 3 millisecs for 1 record.
I am using java client to do this.
Kindly tell if I can increase the speed or rename the bucket.

Thanks in Advance

Vicky Khanna
