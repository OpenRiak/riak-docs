There are 2 Riak API's for Erlang: native and protobuffs.

Protocol Buffers API is better if you're going to connect to remote
nodes as its data format is very compact.
Native API is a bit more convenient for me so I prefer it if not
working with remote nodes.

As for tests, you can pre-create a ETS-based bucket (you can either
set its properties in the app.config file or manually from Erlang) and
run some test operations on it upon Riak client start. So, there's no
need in an additional instance as your buckets can use different
storages.

&gt; I'm start to use Riak in one of my Erlang based projects and looking for a
&gt; ways to automatic test my application with Riak. Is there an easy way to

&gt; tests or I need to emulate Riak's client API myself?
