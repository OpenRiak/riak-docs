Excellent! We've never had any major issues getting Riak to build on FreeBSD 
but it's great to see an official package.

Thank you!

&gt; Riak Users,

&gt; As some of you have noticed we have been committing small changes here and 
&gt; there to help support building Riak on BSD's. We have now gone taken the 
&gt; next step to officially support a BSD with packages in a release. I wrote up 
&gt; a short blog post about our coming support for FreeBSD in the next major Riak 
&gt; release here
