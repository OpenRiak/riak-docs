Have you tried raising the limit for open filehandles (ulimit -n)?
Each TCP connection also uses one filehandle, and by default they will
linger around for 60 seconds after the connection is closed.

The PHP client uses the REST interface afaik, so I assume it will open a
new TCP connection for each request. What /proc/sys/fs/file-nr while you
are running your test. What does the first column show when the request
start to fail? I would guess about 2048 if you run riak and your test
script on the same machine or about 1024 if they are on different
machines.

You could also try tp lower /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp\\_fin\\_timeout to say
10, which should be more than enough on a LAN. This means closed TCP
connections only linger for 10 seconds, so unless you do more than about
10000 requests/s the default filehandle limit should be enough.

Of course on a production system you should read up on these settings
and set them according to your load and usage patterns.

Cheers,
Nico

&gt; We're seeing a repeatable error -- running some tests with Riak
&gt; 0.14.0-1 on Ubuntu, with PHP 5.3.3-1ubuntu9.3
&gt; 
&gt; We have a load test, using the PHP client, which stores then gets 1MM
&gt; objects. This is being run against both Riak and MySQL as part of a
&gt; performance evaluation suite. The MySQL side runs fine, so the test
&gt; script seems fine.
&gt; 
&gt; On the Riak side, we generally get an exception from
&gt; RiakObject::populate() which throws 'Could not contact Riak Server..'
&gt; after having done between 10-20K store/get pairs, each with different
&gt; keys. It doesn't always happen.
&gt; 
&gt; There's nothing else running on this system, and we see it both on our
&gt; VMware instances and on an EC2 m1.xlarge
&gt; 
&gt; I get the sense that our Riak client is causing a temporary DoS on our
&gt; Riak server...
&gt; Has anyone else seen this?
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe adding some retry logic into the client would resolve it?
&gt;
