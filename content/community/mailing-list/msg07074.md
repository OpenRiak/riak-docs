Hey riak-users,

In an ongoing effort to get our client-libraries in order, I've moved a
whole slew of existing bug reports and issues from our Bugzilla over to
Github issues. If you were already CC'ed on a Bugzilla ticket, you should
have received notification that this occurred. Here's a list of the bugs I
have moved, touched, or closed (not all became issues on Github):

riak-search\\_0.14.2-1\\_i386.deb

689 make fails: riakc\\_pb\\_socket.erl:72: type ctx() undefined

You can go to https://issues.basho.com/ to see the original
issue. Feel free to ask any questions or add your own comments to the new
issues on Github, \\*do not use the Bugzilla tickets\\*. All future issue
management for clients will be done on Github.

Thanks!
