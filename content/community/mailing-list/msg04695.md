Hi,

I store data in Riak whose keys constantly get overwritten with new data.
I'm currently using Bitcask as the back-end and recently noticed the Bitcask
data folder grow to 24GB. After restarting the nodes, which I think
triggered Bitcask merge, the data went down to 96MB. Today the data dirs are
back up to around 500MB. Would an alternate backend better suit this type of
use case where keys are constantly being overwritten?
