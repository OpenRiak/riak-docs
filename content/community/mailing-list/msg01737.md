Hi Dan,

There is no error messages in my riak log files during that node error
occurred. Ulimit already set to 1024, should I increase to 2048?

Thanks,
Abe

&gt; Are there any error messages in your riak log files? Also, you may want to
&gt; try bumping up ulimit.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I often encounter {error,{could\\_not\\_reach\\_node,'r...@192.168.1.\\*\\*\\*'} when
&gt;&gt; there are many concurrent connection being made to riak node. How should I
&gt;&gt; avoid this problem?Should I increase the number of concurrent
&gt;&gt; connection?how?I use riak with default configuration and ulimit -n set to
&gt;&gt; 1024. Should I increase async threads in vm.args?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance.
