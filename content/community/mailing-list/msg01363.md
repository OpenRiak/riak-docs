Hi,
While playing with Riak Search through the Solr interface, I noticed
that my documents are automatically written in bitcask under the
bucket "\\_rsid\\_". Is it a feature of the Solr interface and is
there a way to prevent the document being indexed to be stored ? If I
use a Riak K/V hook, I guess that the documents are not stored twice
in bitcask ?
Cheers,
Emmanuel
