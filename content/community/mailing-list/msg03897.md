Hey All,

A few weeks back we decided to turn the Riak Recap into a blog [1].
I'm happy to report that the Recap blog is online an operational!
Here's the inaugural post:

http://recap.basho.com/2011/06/30/Welcome-to-the-Riak-Recap-Blog/

As promised, I'll be posting the Recaps to the blog (in addition to
the mailing list, of course). More importantly, the RSS feed is
working and ready for a deluge of subscribers. I'm sure we'll tweak
the design a bit, but this should work for now. (You might notice that
it bears a striking similarity to blog.basho.com...) The code for the
Recap blog is open source, too [2], so if any of you get ambitious and
want to pretty it up, don't hesitate to send us a pull request (just
don't criticize my brute-force CSS).

Mark

PS - No Recap tomorrow or next Monday (due to holidays and vacations).
As usual, if anyone wants to step up and write the Recap on either of
those days, have at it.
