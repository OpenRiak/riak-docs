Hi Tim,

No, that's not currently possible.

Just to clarify, when you say you want the "respective value", do you mean
the object's value in Riak (ie: the result of a GET operation) or rather
the index's value (ie: the value associated with the \\_int index)?

Thanks,
Rusty

&gt; Is it possible to return a value along with a 2i query? For instance, if
&gt; I perform a range query against an \\_int index, can I return both the
&gt; relevant and keys their respective value for that field?
&gt;
&gt; If not, can they be accessed in a reduce function without loading the
&gt; document?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
