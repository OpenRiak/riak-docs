Mike,

you need to make sure the followers field is marked as a numeric field in the 
bucket's schema in Riak Search. You can do that by either relying on the 
default schema and appending \\_num to the field name, so it'd be followers\\_num 
instead of followers in the JSON you're generating.

Or you could set your own custom schema for the bucket, telling Riak Search to 
treat the followers field as a numeric field. Both is detailed on our wiki:
