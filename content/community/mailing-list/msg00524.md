&gt; Good question.  That won't quite do it, because the node will give up
&gt; ownership of the partitions first, and that will cause it to begin
&gt; pushing off that data to the new owners.
&gt;
&gt; We hope to add a more obvious sign in the stats resource for this, but
&gt; for now the easiest way to tell is to just look at the disk usage in
&gt; the exiting node's data directory.  It should become empty when the
&gt; node completes handing off data.

"become empty" - does that hold for all different backends? I could
imagine the dets backend removing all files when it's done, but will
the InnoDB backend do the same?
