Good news everyone! CorrugatedIron v0.2.0 has been released. This brings the 
.NET client up to date with Riak 1.0.

You can download code from 
https://github.com/DistributedNonsense/CorrugatedIron or through NuGet 
https://github.com/DistributedNonsense/CorrugatedIron

What's new in this release?

\\* Basic support for Riak Search by adding a modfunarg map reduce input
\\* Support for Riak Indexes through a new map reduce input
\\* Re-written fluent key filter interface to make life much easier when building 
key filter queries
\\* Support for Riak 1.0 buffered responses
\\* Indexes can be saved on a RiakObject. Support is included for automatic name 
mangling (it isn't strictly necessary to save an index with \\_bin or \\_int, but 
you really should)
\\* Added convenience constants for designating quorum values.
\\* vnode\\_vclock behavior is supported out of the box but the Riak 0.14.2 
behavior can be enabled by setting VnodeVlocks at either the node or cluster 
level
\\* All PBC and HTTP options are supported

Also, we've received our first community contribution from Matthew Whitfield: 
https://github.com/DistributedNonsense/CorrugatedIron/issues/18

Thank you Matthew for contributing that fix.
