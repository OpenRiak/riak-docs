Greetings.

I'm running Mac OS X 10.5.8. Riak 0.10.1 is compiled and works good.
However, when I install Innostore like described at the wiki page and
try to perform any operations with Riak, node goes down.

When I start riak using `bin/riak console`, everything seems to work good:

100516 12:48:13 Embedded InnoDB 1.0.6.6750 started; log sequence number 44243

But when I try to get keys from a bucket, to put any data using basic
Erlang interface (either from the other Erlang node or from the opened
console), Riak crashes with bus error.
I tried to start Riak as root but with the same result. Then thought
that perhaps free disk space is too low (about 12 GB) and freed some
space (up to about 20 GB) but still get the same result. Also, tried
to turn SMP on and off - still no result.

I'm going to try installing it on my FreeBSD machine, will write about
the results.
