Hey fellows,

I have few questions:

1) I know that minimal recommended size of Cluster is 5 nodes.
 However I have at this point only two servers.

 a) Would the data be replicated among those two servers. If one node is
down,
 would other node cover whole DB?
 b) When I add new 3 nodes, would the data be replicated among the nodes
in
 the same (best) way as if it would be 5 nodes from the beginning?

2) What are general symptoms that new node should be added?

Thanks all,
 Pavel
