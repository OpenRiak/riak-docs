&gt; Your search/luwak tests are failing, presumably because those options

&gt;
&gt; $ SKIP\\_SEARCH=1 SKIP\\_LUWAK=1 python setup.py test

Thanks, I tried this right after I sent the email. It helped some (17
skipped tests) but it's still failing

&gt;
&gt; You also seem to be running into a problem with leftover keys in one
&gt; of the test buckets. That problem is fixed by pull request #67, which
&gt; has not been merged :-( ... if you grab that fix, then a couple of
&gt; your errors will go away.

yep, some of them did, thanks. I updated the log at the same url,
after these two changes I still have

FAILED (failures=6, errors=2, skipped=17)

&gt; I see some additional failures based on extra siblings... I don't know
&gt; what is happening there.

&gt;&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I cannot get the test suite in the python client to run, I have tried
&gt;&gt; on Arch Linux on my notebook and then on an Ubunty Natty system on EC2
&gt;&gt; with riak 1.0.0:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-1.0.0/riak\\_1.0.0-1\\_amd64.deb
&gt;&gt; sudo dpkg -i riak\\_1.0.0-1\\_amd64.deb
&gt;&gt; sudo /etc/init.d/riak start
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; sudo apt-get install python-protobuf
&gt;&gt; git clone git://github.com/basho/riak-python-client.git
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; virtualenv riak
&gt;&gt; . riak/bin/activate
&gt;&gt; cd riak-python-client
&gt;&gt; python setup.py install
&gt;&gt; python setup.py test
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; and I get:
&gt;&gt; FAILED (failures=6, errors=19)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The full test output can be found at:
&gt;&gt; http://www.honzakral.com/riak\\_python\\_test.out
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If anybody can point out what I did wrong or how to make the tests
&gt;&gt; work I would be most grateful.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
