Sven is correct. But in exactitude this is a base 62 encoding (a-zA-Z0-9).
The collision function of concern here is the erlang implementation of sha.
Oh, and ya, have a high degree of confidence in it.

&gt;&gt; well, maybe i'm wrong, but i don't think base64 is very collision-free if
&gt;&gt; you have millions of entries in a same bucket... because even your
algorithm
&gt;&gt; include some uniqueness on it, base64 encoding it could get into some
&gt;&gt; collision:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; base64(superawesomeuniquestring) can be same as
&gt;&gt; base64(anothersuperawesomeuniquestring)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Actually, that's not correct. Base64 is just a simple encoding algorithm,
&gt; completely lossless and with a unique output for every unique input.
&gt; In other words, base64(somestring) != base64(someotherstring) always holds
&gt; true.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe you are confusing it with destructive cryptographic functions like
MD5
&gt; ?
