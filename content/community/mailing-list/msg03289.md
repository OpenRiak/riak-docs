Hmm...ok. Will have to ponder how we can fix that.

Thanks!

&gt; I believe problem occours if there happens to be another process with
&gt; the same PID as the old (now gone) riak node. This can happen if the
&gt; machine was rebooted since the riak node crashed or if the PIDs wrapped,
&gt; they are only two bytes after all.
&gt; os\\_pid\\_exists/1 only checks for ANY process with the PID from the
&gt; lockfile
&gt; (https://github.com/basho/bitcask/blob/master/src/bitcask\\_lockops.erl#L116).

&gt;&gt; &gt; I know we did a forced shutdown this week, which was probably the cause.  
&gt;&gt; &gt; But I would have thought that riak would have taken care of its own lock 
&gt;&gt; &gt; file bookkeeping on restarting.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Bitcask does:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/basho/bitcask/blob/master/src/bitcask\\_lockops.erl#L46
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's curious that the logic didn't handle the case. What platform/OS
&gt;&gt; are you on? Are you using init scripts to restart on boot?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; D.
