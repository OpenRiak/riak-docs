I am working on a new protocol buffer based client using the master riak\\_pb 
repository. I would just like to inquire on the state of riak\\_kv with the 
latest pb, specifically is RpbIndexReq and RpbSearchQueryReq implemented yet (I 
know it is not in 1.1.4), if not is there a road map or any idea when.

Thanks!

Andrew
