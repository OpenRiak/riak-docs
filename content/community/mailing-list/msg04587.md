It looks like riak\\_kv\\_index\\_backend has been removed in the master. I
tried, instead, with riak\\_eleveldb\\_backend and noticed there are some
changes to the index meta data. Is it possible to brief the changes? I am
using riak:localclient and try to understand the new Index query spec.
Earlier it used to be [{QueryType, Index\\_Field, [Index\\_Value]}] .

Thanks,
Senthil
