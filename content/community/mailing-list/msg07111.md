Hey riak-users,

We've just released the official Ruby client for Riak version 1.0.2, which
is now available on Github and Rubygems. (Note: v1.0.1 was yanked but its
fixes are included in this release.) This release fixes a few bugs,
including HTTPS/SSL configuration and compatibility with Excon and Rails
3.2.

Read the complete list of changes here:

Please file any issues you find on the Github tracker:
