Good catch! Thank you. If I have three machines that take up ports
8098,8099, and 8100 what do you suggest the handoff port should be? When is
it used?


No problem!

Each machine can use the same ports as the other machines. You just 
can't use the same ports on the same machine. Setting different port 
numbers on different machines just complicates things for no reason. In 
theory, your app.config file can (should?) be identical for all your 
Riak nodes in a cluster.


So, for instance, if you decided to use ports 8098 for pb\\_port, 8099 for 
http and 8100 for handoff\\_port then you could set those ports the same 
on all three of your machines.


The handoff\\_port is used for each node of the cluster to talk to each other.

Hope this helps!

Shane.
