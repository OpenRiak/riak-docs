Mark -

I think that's a great idea. I'd go even further, and suggest that the 
valuable information discussed on the mailing list be managed in a searchable 
form, as is the case with Google or Yahoo Groups. (Is it searchable now? I 
couldn't see how to search the entire archive for a keyword.)

This would be helpful for we users of riak, and even possibly for riak 
developers, since finding more information might prevent people from asking a 
question that has already been asked in the past, saving them time. In this 
case, you might want to copy the Recap to a message on the mailing list, so 
it's searchable there as well.


Along the same lines, it would be great if the platform used had an rss 
feed. In general I prefer email messages that all come to my mailbox 
instead of web sites that have to be visited individually for every 
interest you might have. But - if the web site provides an rss feed you 
can plug it into google reader or similar rss aggregator and still see 
everything new in one place either with a web browser or smart phone.
