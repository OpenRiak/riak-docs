Hi, Mikhail.

The "map" part of the MapReduce programming paradigm is not only
inherently parallel, it also does not impose a point of order on the
overall dataflow and thus does not introduce a concurrency barrier.
In practical terms this means that individual data items can be
processed as soon as they arrive, and the results can be immediately
pushed on to the next phase of the overall job without waiting for all
other data to make it through the map.

The "reduce" part does not have this pleasant property, as that phase
is present in order to perform exactly the kinds of operations (such
as counting) that do require waiting.
