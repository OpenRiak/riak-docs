I am not quite sure what could have happened, but if it does stop responding I 
would recommend looking at the logs. also instead of starting it via console, I 
would recommend just doing a start and using the attach command to attach to 
the console.

&gt; Hi guys!
&gt; 
&gt; the smp fix you guys provided solved our speed issues, thank you so much! 
&gt; However, the server stopped responding to requests randomly in the middle of 
&gt; the day and when I went to restart it, I got the message that it was not 
&gt; pingable. Now whenever I sudo riak start I get a server not pingable error. 
&gt; I went it and KILL -9 erlang, tried the riak console, and then after that 
&gt; was able to start the server again using restart. It now is up and running, 
&gt; but any ideas why it went down and restart didn't work?
