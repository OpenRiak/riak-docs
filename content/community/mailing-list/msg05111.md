Hi,

I have 2 questions about the riak's new feature - secondary index.

1. Is there the scalability benchmark of the secondary index feature? I
read some blog about the implementation of riak secondary index, but it
seems to run scanning across mostly all nodes at worst case if my
expectation is correct. Secondary index feature of riak is more scalable
than the one of Cassandra?

2. Where is the metadata which the nodes contain the indexed data? Is it
distributed across riak storage servers by consistent hashing?

Thank you.

Best Regards,
OZAWA Tsuyoshi
