A tip listed at [1] caught my eye:

 Remove riak data from this directory:

 /var/lib/riak/leveldb

I'm curious whether it anyhow suggests that there's something wrong with
leveldb backend (perhaps, in specific use cases??)... (A colleague of
mine and I are considering using 2i (which is only available with
leveldb backend) and any input regarding this very backend would be
welcome :))
