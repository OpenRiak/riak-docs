Hi,
 RiakSearch is treating the queryterm as "\\*" when queryterm is of the form
"\\_" (eg:name\\_1,name\\_1) and returns the entire
record set. Is this a known issue?

Example:

Key Field1 Field2
key1 field\\_a sometext
key2 field\\_c sometext.


When queried for Field1 with queryterm as "field\\_a" solr search returns
both key1 and key2 instead of key1 alone.

Vijayakumar.
