Hi riak gurus,

Riak is a perfect key-value data store that allows to distribute load across 
the nodes based on the Dynamo principles.
What Iâ€™d like to achieve is to have the preferred list be sorted based on the 
current load (maybe erlang:statistics(run\\_queue)) of the nodes.

Is it possible to change the hashing function somehow so that the vnode on the 
node with the minimal load is returned as the first one?

Best Regards,
Sergey
