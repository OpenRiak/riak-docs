&gt; I found a bug in Riak, where do I file it?

&gt; The bug is that if you use the tokenize key filter and pass in an index that 
&gt; is out of bounds, no error is spit back like Index Out of bounds error. 
&gt; Instead it just hangs the server and a response is never delivered.

I think it is already filed as a bug, can't find it at first glance but I'm 
rushing to catch a plane so will check later.

I have a fix for it here, though:
