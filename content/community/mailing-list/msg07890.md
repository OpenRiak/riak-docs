Wu,

As long as you are not setting properties on those buckets, there are very
few reasons why performance would be adversely affected. The bucket can
simply be considered a prefix for the key.

&gt; The common situation is there is hundreds buckets, every bucket has

&gt; buckets , every bucket has kv pairs from dozens to hundreds.

&gt; So, in this condition, is Riak stiil a good solution, I means the
&gt; performance and second index search.
