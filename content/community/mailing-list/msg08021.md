@siculars The funny thing is that I used your blog for an inspiration for my
code ( The code that was originally posted in this thread. ) I'm not doing
things exactly the same way you did in your post. I just can't figure out
why the code from your blog post works and mine does not. Mine just returns
null for Date.parse(). 

Any help is greatly appreciated.
