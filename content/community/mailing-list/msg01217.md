Hi folks,

i am experimenting with riak and have a problem with too many links in a
riak object.
If i store the object the server send 400 Bad Request. This is caused from
the link header which is too long.
As workaround i thought about storing the links inside the riak object and
fetch them in a map reduce query.
Is it possible to do a link phase after a map phase in riak and if so has
somebody an example for this?

Thanks and regards
Jan
