Will,

You ever figure this out?

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I'm having weird problems with the riak-java-client. When I use it
&gt; with Clojure/Leiningen it hangs compiling. Here's a gist to show how
&gt; to replicate the problem: https://gist.github.com/1120747
&gt; or.. to download the project ready to be run:
&gt; http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8134194/riaktest.zip
&gt;
&gt; So, when you run "lein compile", it appears to compile the class fine,
&gt; but hangs after that. If you remove the riak-java-client lib and print
&gt; hello world - it's fine again. This only happens on Linux.
&gt;
&gt; Any help with this would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Will
