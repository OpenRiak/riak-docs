Sebastian,

While it might work, we did not specifically test upgrades from 0.14.2,
only 1.0 and 1.1.

&gt; is it a good idea to upgrade a small (3 node) cluster straight to 1.2 from
&gt; 0.14.2. Especially with riak's 1.2 capabilities negotiation, it feels like
&gt; the upgrade process should be much simpler now? We don't do any M/R jobs
&gt; currently and we are only using bitcask right now.
