&gt; Hi, guys
&gt;
&gt; I am using luwak as dfs, right now we have couple riak nodes like 10
&gt; there. Here is the problem we encountered, after write file success, the
&gt; next read operation always fail. it happens when that is a little bit big
&gt; file size. is there any way to get rid of that. because we want the user
&gt; can get that file which is uploaded by him real time. For example, write
&gt; file to riak node 3 should always guarantee the next read operation on that
&gt; file to riak node 3 should be success.
&gt;
