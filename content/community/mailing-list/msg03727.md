Please read my other responses in this thread, riak absolutely \\*does\\*
have tombstones. And if you don't have all the primary nodes for a key
up at the time of a delete, you'll write tombstones they just won't be
able to trigger an actual removal of the key.

Now, that said. 0.14 has several bugs in how delete works and so the
behaviour is probably going to be unpredictable. To be perfectly honest,
I recommend avoiding deletes where possible on 0.14. As you suggested,
implementing tombstones at the application layer might be a better
strategy until the next major riak release. Unfortunately, the changes
were too extensive to be backported into the 0.14 branch.
