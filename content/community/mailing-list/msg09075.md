Hey All,

I was going to put this in the Recap but it didn't seem right...

The first round of RICON videos are now online:

http://basho.com/community/ricon2012/#videos

We'll be rolling out four/week for the next five weeks or so - only
because Vimeo allows us no more than 5GB/week for uploads :(

Enjoy. There are some awesome talks up already, including Andrew
Thompson's and Joseph Blomstedt's.
