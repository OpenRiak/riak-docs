Hi guys!

the smp fix you guys provided solved our speed issues, thank you so much!
However, the server stopped responding to requests randomly in the middle of
the day and when I went to restart it, I got the message that it was not
pingable. Now whenever I sudo riak start I get a server not pingable
error. I went it and KILL -9 erlang, tried the riak console, and then after
that was able to start the server again using restart. It now is up and
running, but any ideas why it went down and restart didn't work?

Tyler
