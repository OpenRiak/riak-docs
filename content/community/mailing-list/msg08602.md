ThoughtLeadr uses Bip's approach. Its essential lazy schema migration.

&gt; I have also used Bip's method and found it successful. You do need to be
&gt; careful to make sure
&gt; all reads of your data go through this upgrade-path, but that is easy once
&gt; you realize it :).

&gt; We use a technique that works well for our use case:
&gt; We store everything as JSON and use the erlang-client, for every object we
&gt; store we add an opaque schema\\_version tag to the JSON and then in our model
&gt; encode/decode routine we parse this schema\\_version and if the version is
&gt; not the latest according to the model we recurse and upgrade the payload
&gt; all the way up to the current version and then return the new object to the
&gt; client and spawn an async process that saves the new object back.
&gt;
&gt; So for instance an object is at schema\\_version 1 when it get's read. The
&gt; model is now on version 5 there will be five functions, i.e:
&gt; upgrade\\_version(2, Payload) -&gt;
&gt; do\\_something();
&gt; upgrade\\_version(3, Payload) -&gt;
&gt; etc...
&gt;
&gt; every function knows how to upgrade itself from it's former version so
&gt; fast forwarding through version is easy and every object will get upgraded
&gt; eventually (if the get read).

&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I'm beginning to experiment with Riak and I'm trying to better
&gt; understand how to model my data. One question I have at the moment is
&gt; how to evolve my data with a data store such as Riak? I know that
&gt; it's schema-less and that I can add new fields as needed but I'm
&gt; thinking more about the existing documents.
&gt;
&gt; For example, say hypothetically, that I have a fairly successful
&gt; riak-based app. As the application code continues to evolve over
&gt; several versions I begin to find a "better" way to model my data. By
&gt; this time I have already stored many, many documents. What is the
&gt; appropriate path here? Do I version my documents with metadata and
&gt; rely on my application code to continue to deal with old-style
&gt; documents -- or do I perform some sort of bulk transformation on these
&gt; existing documents?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Allen
