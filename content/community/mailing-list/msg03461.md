Hi, all. If I have several riak servers on a cluster, and want to distribute 
load fairly evenly, and am using the Ruby Riak client, what is the best way to 
balance load?

With the HTTP interface, I can randomize the choice of host for a request. How 
would I do the same with the ruby client? Would I create a Riak::Client for 
each host, and then just randomize the selection of those for a given call? Do 
the clients contain any state that would make this a bad idea? Or is there a 
better way to do this?

Thanks,
Keith
