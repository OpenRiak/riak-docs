hi,

i am querying a bucket using the pbc API in erlang. while the query works
fine and i get the filtered result, sorting doesn't seem to work. for
example:

riakc\\_pb\\_socket:search(Pid, &lt;&lt;"queue"&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;"status:uploaded"&gt;&gt;, [{sort,
&lt;&lt;"date desc"&gt;&gt;}]).

The query above returns the filtered data, but it is unsorted. With cURL i
get a sorted result:

curl "
http://192.168.178.30:8098/solr/queue/select?q=status:uploaded&sort=date+desc
"

For what i've seen in the documentation and in the riak source code, the
sorting option should be correct? But: it seems, that sorting does not work
at all.

Any ideas what could be wrong or what i could do to figure out whats going
on?

thanks in advance!

harald
