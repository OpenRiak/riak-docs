Howdy Gang,

We are having a bit of an issue with our 3-node riaksearch cluster. What is 
happing is this:

Cluster is up and running. We start testing our application against it. As 
the application runs the erlang process consumes more and more memory without 
ever releasing it.

In trying to investigate the issue we ran the riaksearch-admin cluster\\_info 
command. It appears that the bulk of this memory is being consumed by a bunch 
of mailboxes. 

I have posted both the output of the cluster\\_info command and the app.config 
from one of the nodes here:

https://gist.github.com/996419

I would be very grateful if someone from Basho would take a look at the 
cluster\\_info and see if they can spot anything obvious.

Each machine in the cluster has an 8-core Xeon and 16GB RAM. I believe all of 
the platform details, etc., are in the cluster\\_info dump.

Many thanks,

--gordon
