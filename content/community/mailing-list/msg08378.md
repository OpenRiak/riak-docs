Hey,

I'm looking to use riak to store time series. So naturaly i'm in the
processes of validating all possible methods this query. A object
has a id, origin, timestamp and type. The query in question is to
select all object within a time range that originated from "origin"
and has a certain "type".

The current plan is to store the timestamp as a secondary index and
then have composite keys responsible for matching origin/type predicate.

A key would look like this: "::".

To query one would just pipe the 2i query to key filter map reduce:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"inputs":{
"bucket" : "seriesx", "index" : "timestamp\\_int", "start" : 123,
"end" : 456, "key\\_filters" : [["ends\\_with", ":"]]}}'

In regards to this "imaginary" solution i have a few questions:
 1) is this possible, or does key filter only work on a bucket?
 2) Would this be a efficient solution, considering the 2i query
 will return 10k+ results? the reduce should cut that in half.
 3) What other options to i have for querying this? Obviously i can
 use Riak search, but the term based indexing puts me off. Other
 option is building this manually with empty object just linking.
