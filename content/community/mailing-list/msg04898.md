 Hi Jon, 

I'm running the 1.0 RC1 build. I'm doing a bunch of basho\\_bench testing, so 
there's a pretty high turnover where I'm creating a bunch of keys and then 
running a script to delete them all. At some point I noticed that failing on a 
whole bunch of keys and observed the state I described.

Thanks

&gt; Hi Greg,
&gt; 
&gt; What version of riak did you experience this with? Were the keys being 
&gt; created and deleted in cycles or were they one off create/deletes?
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've got my riak ring in a state where streaming keys or curling a bucket 
&gt; &gt; with ?keys = true returns a whole bunch of keys of deleted objects.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since this is test data, I'm going to go ahead and blow away the bitcask 
&gt; &gt; folders and start over, but I'm wondering if anybody could shed some light 
&gt; &gt; on how I might have gotten into this state and how I can get out.
