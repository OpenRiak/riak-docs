This functionality is not currently available, no. You can only query one
index at a time.

&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; Is there any way to query with 2 secondary indexes at the same time?
&gt;
&gt; I can query 1 index like:
&gt; http://{RIAK\\_HOST}:8098/buckets/products/index/category\\_bin/sports
&gt;
&gt; or:
&gt; http://{RIAK\\_HOST}:8098/buckets/products/index/price\\_int/200
&gt;
&gt; But is there any way you could query for both indexes at the same time? say
&gt; you want sport products that costs 200?
&gt;
&gt; something like this could be great:
&gt; http://
&gt; {RIAK\\_HOST}:8098/buckets/articles/index/category\\_bin/sports/index/price\\_int/200
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
