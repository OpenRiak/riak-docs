I thought I had. I put "enable, true" not "enabled, true" though. My fault! 
Sorry to bug the list.

Do you have this in your app.config?

Did you enable the bucket that you want to search for indexing? Off the top of 
my head it is something like

http://127.0.0.1:8098:/riak/bucket?search=true

note to basho: i could not find the relevant instructions on the wiki nor the 
knowledgebase. and i clicked around a bunch.

Hello,

I have a Riak cluster that is up and accepts PUTs and GETs. I'm trying to use 
the search features and it looks like the Erlang processes for search are not 
running. I keep getting 'noproc' errors. Search has always been enabled on this 
cluster, I did not add search later on. The search feature appears in 
"riak-admin status", so the code has at least been loaded by Riak. Riak is not 
leaving any logs besides crash.log, which contains the same error message that 
search-cmd printed.

How can I get search working? Thanks.
