&gt; &gt; &gt; At this time there are no plans for a 0.14.3 release.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just to be clear: are there any plans to cut a release with the 14B03
&gt; &gt; fixes in it anytime soon (perhaps 0.15, etc..I don't care if it is
&gt; &gt; literally another 0.14 point release per se). FWIW, I am dead in the
&gt; &gt; water w.r.t. Riak until this is fixed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; The prebuilt riak binaries shouldn't use the system erlang install, the
&gt; binary includes its own copy of the erlang VM. The R14B03
&gt; incompatability will manifest as a compile time issue too, not a runtime
&gt; one. I suspect something else is wrong.
&gt;
&gt;
Any tips on how to debug? I blew away the data/logs in the hope that either
the something in the data was causing the immediate shutdown, or that some
newly minted logs would reveal the problem. Neither seemed to work, it just
silently dies.
