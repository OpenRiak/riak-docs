Hi Eric,

No, node.js cannot be used as a map/reduce worker.

Unrelated to Riak there are a few Erlang based projects you might find
interesting:

Thank you,

&gt;
&gt; I think that may be a Erlang question more than a Riak question.
&gt;
&gt; Can I use Riak to superviseand distribute task to node.js process?
&gt;
&gt; I know that is possible for Erlang to supervise python program.
&gt; That should be possible to supervise any program too.
&gt;
&gt; Any plan for that?
