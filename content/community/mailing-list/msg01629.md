Did you pull down the riak sources by cloning the github repo or did you
just download from somewhere?

&gt; Hi I've been able to get riak funning using brew but getting some glitches
with client code so I decided to install from source to see if it helps any.
Here is the error I'm getting:
&gt;
&gt; abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)
&gt; ./rebar get-deps
&gt; Uncaught error in rebar\\_core: {'EXIT',
&gt; {undef,

&gt; {escript,run,2},
&gt; {escript,start,1},
&gt; {init,start\\_it,1},
&gt; {init,start\\_em,1}]}}
&gt;
&gt; =ERROR REPORT==== 26-Nov-2010::22:40:37 ===
&gt; Error in process &lt;0.30.0&gt; with exit value:

&gt;
&gt; make: \\*\\*\\* [deps] Error 1
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Obviously it's looking for something that's not there... what libs need to
be installed or present in the build package for this to work ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
