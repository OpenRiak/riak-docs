Wow. Yes. "Riak on FreeBSD" is what I was going for.


&gt; Emails need a wiki feature ;-)
&gt;
&gt; If no-one else steps forward, I'll attempt a FreeBSD build this weekend.
&gt; FreeBSD used to be my primary server OS (until Ubuntu Server won me over),
&gt; so I've got some familiarity there.
&gt;

Thanks, Jonathan!
