Hi Gal,

Here is one of the examples that I've found useful in the past for exactly
this purpose:

&gt; Hi all
&gt; I've been doing some work with Secondary Indexes and noticed this on
&gt; the web site:
&gt; "The $key index field is a special field that is implicitly indexed on
&gt; all objects when Secondary Indexes is enabled. The value of this field
&gt; is the object's key, so this field allows an application to perform
&gt; range queries across the keys in a bucket"
&gt; (http://wiki.basho.com/Secondary-Indexes.html)
&gt;
&gt; However, I can't seem to find an example using it for queries anywhere
&gt; (Curl, RiakJS, Java client) or a way of seeing that it was indeed
&gt; created/used...
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be appreciated
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt; Gal
