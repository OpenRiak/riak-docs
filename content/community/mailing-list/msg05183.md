Hi,
I've just released 1.0.1 of the riak-java-client to Sonatype. There was a bug 
with PB client connection pool idle connection reap task. In certain situations 
it could go into a prolonged or infinite loop. 1.0.1 fixes this issue[1] as 
well as another bug with the PB client factory that did not start the PB 
connection pool reaper thread before using the pool[2].

Sorry about the bugs, please use the 1.0.1 release and \\*not\\* 1.0.0.

Cheers

Russell
