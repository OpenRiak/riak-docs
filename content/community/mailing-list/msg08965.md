&gt; Right - if you want read your own writes consistency you need to make Riak

&gt; 3) for writes and r at least 2 for reads. This, of course, means that you're
&gt; going to lose.

And even that only works for a single writer. It won't prevent
concurrent creation of the same key by different writers - there is no
atomic operation for that.
