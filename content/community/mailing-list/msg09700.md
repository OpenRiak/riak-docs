&gt; All socket operations. It looks as though those that open a new socket are

&gt; have posted to the list before but don't have access to all of the details at 
&gt; the moment.

Sorry, I mean what type of Riak operations? Store, fetch, MapReduce,
etc? What is actually timing out?

&gt; I suspect that there are additional timeouts to be configured and the 
&gt; previous default
&gt; values have been lowered. I tried bumping the requestTimeout to no avail. 
&gt; This wouldn't
&gt; explain the strange latency spikes (via /stats) seen as we began rolling out 
&gt; the new driver.

It really shouldn't change any of this. Even the withoutFetch()
feature as it just ... doesn't do a fetch.

Since you're using that new feature, how are you using it? Is this
storing new objects, or are you providing a vclock from a previous
fetch?

Thanks,
