Hi,
We are exploring using Riak as our persistent storage for our next project.
Does Java client support search with paging and sorting, like the web solr api?
If yes, can you point one with class/method support it?

Here is an example with page and number of rows per page set,

curl "http://localhost:8098/solr/books/select?start=0&rows=10000&q=prog\\*"

If not, is there a plan to add the support to the Java client? Can we help?

Thanks.
