Riak Recap for February 6 - 7
======================

1) Jared sent this to the list yesterday but it's worth including in the
Recap again: Riak 1.1RC1 was just released. There's a lot of good stuff in
this release, and we would love some people to take it for a spin before
it's official.

\\* All the details here ---&gt;

2) Basho is officially a sponsor of the Travis CI project. Travis is a
distributed build system that you should all take a look at.
