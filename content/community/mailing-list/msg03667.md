Hi,

we recently upgraded to riak-search 0.14.2 and it seems that the numFound
value returned from SOLR searches is no longer correct.

In one particular search, there are actually 22 results. If I set start = 30
and count = 10, I get 0 results as expected. However, no matter what I set
those to, numFound comes back as 114.

I thought numFound was supposed to return the number of matched documents,
disregarding start and count. Am I misunderstanding something or is this a
bug?

Thanks
-Greg
