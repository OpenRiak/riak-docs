Greetings.

I'm looking for a way to set expiry\\_secs for specific buckets. For
example, if some buckets need to have object expiration time and some
buckets need to have unlimited lifetime.

I've tried to do this using multi\\_backend:

{storage\\_backend, riak\\_kv\\_multi\\_backend},
{multi\\_backend\\_default, &lt;&lt;"default"&gt;&gt;},
{multi\\_backend, [
 {&lt;&lt;"default"&gt;&gt;, riak\\_kv\\_bitcask\\_backend, []},
 {&lt;&lt;"cache"&gt;&gt;, riak\\_kv\\_bitcask\\_backend, [
 {expiry\\_secs, 60},
 ]}
]},

But when I call

riakc\\_pb\\_socket:set\\_bucket(&lt;&lt;"test"&gt;&gt;, [{backend, &lt;&lt;"cache"&gt;&gt;}]),

this setting isn't applied to the bucket. Tried to set different data
directories for both backends – with the same result.

Is such thing possible at all, and if it's possible, what am I doing wrong?

Also, looks like riak\\_kv\\_multi\\_backend.erl has documentation a bit
different with wiki. At wiki backends aliases are binaries, and at the
module's docs they are atoms. Probably, both of them work, but neither
of them worked for me :(
