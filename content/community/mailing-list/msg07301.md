Can someone from Basho clarify?

I understood "handoff" to mean just that it was handing off
\\*responsibility\\* for a vnode to another node, and not proactively
creating additional replicas of the data. This information just came
from our technical contact at Basho on 4/18, so I would assume it's up
to date. But I would be happy to learn that riak-admin leave now does
the right thing.


Not that I work for basho, but I can absolutely confirm that riak-admin 
leave (&gt;= 1.1, don't recall 1.0) does involve taking data the local node 
is responsible for and giving it to the remote node. You can watch the 
file sizes on hosts or network traffic to confirm.
