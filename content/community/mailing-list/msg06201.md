Hi all,

I am running (still) 0.14.2 in production, and using Riak Search to
index certain buckets. Those buckets have the Riak Search pre-commit
hook enabled.

Once in a while I get complaints of missing documents from my clients,
and it just happened.

I checked and the document:
 - is correctly stored in Riak
 - doesn't show up on the search query results \\*anymore\\*

My workaround before was to go through every key in the bucket and
save it again, as to trigger the search hook. Of course, this is less
than ideal.

Should I be looking for something specific in the logs? What could be
going on here?

Thanks,

Francisco
