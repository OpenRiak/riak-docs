Elias,

Which Riak release are you running? Riak 1.0.2?

&gt; &gt; Rebalancing can be quite expensive with the default claim algorithm
&gt; &gt; that ships in all releases to date. In the 1.0.3 release (dropping
&gt; &gt; this week, I hope), we will be switching to a new default claim
&gt; &gt; algorithm that will dramatically decrease the amount of
&gt; &gt; rebalancing/shuffling that will be required. With this change in
&gt; &gt; place, we've seen production clusters grow from 11 to 30+ nodes with
&gt; &gt; minimal impacts.
&gt; 
&gt; David. Thanks for the update on the changes. They sounds great.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes, they should be rolling stats on a 1 minute interval. We've observed 
&gt; &gt; normal behaviour in the production systems we've seen, but
&gt; &gt; I'll ask someone to double check that they are working correctly.
&gt; &gt; Thanks for reporting this.
&gt; 
&gt; That's what I thought. Very strange. Let me know if there any debug data I 
&gt; can provide to assist.
