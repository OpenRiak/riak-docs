&gt; This is probably an FAQ but I was unable to find an answer so hopefully

&gt;
&gt; The “Quick Start” builds a simple cluster all on the same machine (called
&gt; dev1, dev2, and dev3). It assigns the ports, IP addresses, etc. I would
&gt; like to do something similar but I would like the cluster to startup
&gt; automatically. What do I need to add to the configuration file so that all
&gt; of the joins etc. happen on startup? This would be a Ubuntu Server if it
&gt; makes any difference.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There is no configuration option to do this. However, once the nodes have
&gt; been joined to a cluster, they'll
&gt; remain part of the same cluster even if they're restarted. Hope this helps.
&gt;

In addition to that you can use something like Zookeeper to automate a node
joining the cluster on initial spin-up if you're doing auto provisioning of
some kind.
