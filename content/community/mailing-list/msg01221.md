&gt; 300,000 links is probably too large (at least for HTTP). Â At that scale, I
&gt; would consider building tree-like structure where target objects are only
&gt; linked off of the leaves of the tree.

&gt; What is the hard limit on links, through the REST API?
&gt;
&gt; Would it be possible to have an object with say 300,000 links?

&gt; Or is this a terrible idea,

&gt;&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; i am experimenting with riak and have a problem with too many links in a
&gt;&gt; riak object.
&gt;&gt; If i store the object the server send 400 Bad Request. This is caused from
&gt;&gt; the link header which is too long.
&gt;&gt; As workaround i thought about storing the links inside the riak object and
&gt;&gt; fetch them in a map reduce query.
&gt;&gt; Is it possible to do a link phase after a map phase in riak and if so has
&gt;&gt; somebody an example for this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks and regards
&gt;&gt; Jan
