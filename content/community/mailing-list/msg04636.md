When you stay "install and start riak successfully" what exactly do you mean? 
If you're able to download a pre-compiled package of Riak and install it, 
that's logical since it's already been compiled for your platform. Which, in 
turn, makes sense as to why you can't compile something.

On the Linux side of things: Good luck to you, sir. I suspect there's some sort 
of development tools package that you can install that will get your system up 
and running.

&gt; version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-44)) is the unix version. I am able

&gt; After some quick googlin', this is a sign that you don't have a full

&gt; 
&gt; I have no idea how to help you on whichever \\*nix you're using, though.
