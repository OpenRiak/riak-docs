I'm running through some disaster scenarios before bringing a riak cluster into 
production, and have run into a scenario that I can't work through the proper 
resolution for just yet:

Say an ec2 instance that was a part of a ring went away quickly, and data from 
it was unrecoverable.

How might I go about telling the rest of the ring that a new instance that I've 
brought up should take over the vnodes that were on that old instance? This 
sounds like a job for `riak-admin reip`, but after running `reip downed\\_node 
new\\_node`, `riak-admin ringready` still shows that the old nodes are a part of 
the ring and down. I guess what I'd like to do is a posthumeous `leave`?

Thoughts?

Regards -
