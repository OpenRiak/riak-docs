Also, your query may have hit some "not\\_found" objects - you'll probably want 
to filter those out in the reduce phase using values = 
Riak.filterNotFound(values); That could be the source of some errors.

&gt;&gt; 0) I know the MapReduce machinery isn't as user-friendly as it could be. We 
&gt;&gt; are making plans now on ways to dramatically improve things on this front in 
&gt;&gt; the nearish future. I hope to have more details to share soon. We've 
&gt;&gt; committed improvements to the error reporting logic on tip so if you have 
&gt;&gt; the ability to upgrade to tip you should get improved error messages.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Kevin, that's great news. Looking forward to hearing more.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1) Reduce functions are currently called in two different ways. The first 
&gt;&gt; way is to invoke the reduce function with a list of items produced from the 
&gt;&gt; map phase. Internally the MapReduce machinery batches up data as it streams 
&gt;&gt; in from the map phase and sends the batches to the reduce phase.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The second way to invoke a reduce function at the end of the reduce with the 
&gt;&gt; list of data produced via earlier reduce invocations. This is also referred 
&gt;&gt; to as "re-reduce". Riak reduce functions always re-reduce. Re-reduction is a 
&gt;&gt; common source of problems as it tends to catch people off guard. However, 
&gt;&gt; your function looks like it should work. You could try wrapping the function 
&gt;&gt; body in a try/catch and using ejsLog to log the exception to a file. That 
&gt;&gt; should shed some light on what exactly if failing.
&gt; 
&gt; Yea, that was my understanding but indeed, it may have caught me off guard :)
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately I couldn't reproduce the problem with our sum function.
&gt; It works just fine now. What I am totally certain about is that I saw
&gt; it failing (logs are the proof) and by simply './riak restart'-ing the
&gt; problem went away. Hope not to experience something similar in
&gt; production!
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2) How are you reloading new Javascript functions? 'riak-admin js\\_reload' 
&gt;&gt; should cause all the Javascript VMs to restart and start from a clean slate. 
&gt;&gt; If that's not working correctly I'd be very interested in knowing that so I 
&gt;&gt; can fix it before our next release.
&gt; 
&gt; Good point, I am \\*not\\* using named functions so I imagine `riak-admin
&gt; js\\_reload` does not apply to my case (or does it - I never triggered
&gt; it)? Every job I submit is comprised of anonymous functions (except
&gt; Riak built-ins, that is) -- I am developing plenty of ad-hoc queries
&gt; to be run once in a while on our production data.
&gt; 
&gt; The rest of the weirdness could have come from my side (possibly badly
&gt; coded reduce functions). Better error reporting, as well as guidelines
&gt; and gotchas when building reduces and advanced examples, would
&gt; definitely help. What I can say right now is that I'll be closely
&gt; following this matter, and come up asap with any issues I may
&gt; encounter.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I've had a weekend plagued of reduce function errors and general
&gt;&gt;&gt; weirdness, probably due to my ignorance on the subject.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Functions seem to be cached, which makes total sense. But it happened
&gt;&gt;&gt; to me several times sending a \\*different\\* function yet Riak would
&gt;&gt;&gt; completely ignore it and keep on running an older version (i started
&gt;&gt;&gt; noticing when using ejsLog). Is there a way of disabling caching? Hope
&gt;&gt;&gt; i'm missing something big here cause that's super annoying.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; (I've also noticed strange behaviour when executing map/reduce jobs in
&gt;&gt;&gt; parallel and getting results mixed up... \\*sometimes\\* (possibly race
&gt;&gt;&gt; conditions) -- but first I want to make sure it's not the client. And
&gt;&gt;&gt; no, there's no global leakage.).
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Then... what's wrong with this reduce function? It used to run fine,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but now it doesn't anymore. Oh, wait - yes it does again now that I
&gt;&gt;&gt; restarted Riak:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; function(values) {
&gt;&gt;&gt; return [
&gt;&gt;&gt; values.reduce(function(acc, value) {
&gt;&gt;&gt; return acc + (value.fleet || value || 0);
&gt;&gt;&gt; }, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ];
&gt;&gt;&gt; }
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; What can explain this behaviour? ( \\* error logs attached)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm well aware of
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/blob/master/priv/mapred\\_builtins.js
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the few blog posts on the matter. Are there any docs in-between
&gt;&gt;&gt; the basic examples and the source code? (i will delve into it once I
&gt;&gt;&gt; get enough Erlang-fu, promise :)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean, when and how reduces (and re-reduces) are invoked and what you
&gt;&gt;&gt; should expect will be fed to your function, how are they cached and
&gt;&gt;&gt; what should programmers know about, what can/can't be done, more
&gt;&gt;&gt; advanced examples (how do "commutative, associative, and idempotent"
&gt;&gt;&gt; functions reflect in practical terms), etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd love to help with whatever I can (might be good material for a blog 
&gt;&gt;&gt; post).
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Francisco
