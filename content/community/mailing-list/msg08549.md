Hello everyone,
I was following the Riak Fast Track and setting up a dev environment and ran 
into a problem I am having trouble solving so far. When I try to run ./riak 
start I'm getting a generic error saying there was an "Error" reading the 
app.config file. I've navigated there via an Erlang shell and in using 
file:consult/1 I was able to read the terms in just fine. I've been looking but 
haven't found a solution for my particular problem as the similar questions 
surrounding the app.config file had additional error messages which indicated 
the problems. I'm running 64bit version of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Riak 1.2, and 
Erlang R15B01. Has anyone had/solved a similar issue?
Chris.
