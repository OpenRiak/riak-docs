Funny, I was just running those myself. Here are the results:

erlang:length(erlang:ports()).
893

erlang:length(erlang:processes()).
1394

Ports sits very close to that number when things are quiet but I do notice that 
immediately during a failed merge (if I run the statement at the exact right 
moment) it can go up into the 3 thousands. Presumably this number could 
certainly be breaking 4096. I'll up that number in vm.args and see what 
happens.

Thanks!
