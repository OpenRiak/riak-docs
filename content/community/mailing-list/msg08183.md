Hi all,

I've encountered some problems with MR, namely I get "\\*
bad\\_utf8\\_character\\_code\\*" error.
I know that it's caused by having non UTF-8 characters in the data.
The problem is that the data is already stored.

Does anybody know, what are the possible solutions?

Thanks in advance!
Vladimir
