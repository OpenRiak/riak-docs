I'm also noticing an issue with starting riak. I too cannot start riak
regularly, but riak console works just fine.

Checked all the permission, they seems to be okay.

&gt; So one thing that seems bizarre is that riak has created directory structure
&gt; under /tmp to mirror the directory structure from root to the binary
&gt; executable.
&gt;
&gt; For example, after I tried to start riak using the binary installed by brew,
&gt; I noticed this directory structure that got added to /tmp:
&gt;
&gt; ! ls -alhrt /tmp/usr/local/Cellar/riak/1.1.2-x86\\_64/libexec/
&gt; total 0
&gt; drwxr-xr-x 3 shull wheel 102B Jul 13 13:56 ../
&gt; drwxr-xr-x 2 shull wheel 68B Jul 13 14:24 ./
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And similarly for the local pre-packaged version, it created:
&gt;
&gt; ! ls -alhrt /tmp/Users/shull/Dev/prodar/riak-1.1.4/
&gt; total 0
&gt; drwxr-xr-x 3 shull wheel 102B Jul 13 14:08 ../
&gt; drwxr-xr-x 4 shull wheel 136B Jul 16 11:56 ./
&gt; prw------- 1 shull wheel 0B Jul 16 11:57 erlang.pipe.1.w|
&gt; prw------- 1 shull wheel 0B Jul 16 11:57 erlang.pipe.1.r|
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I guess there's nothing really \\*wrong\\* with that, it just kind of worried me
&gt; at first to see that directory structure under /tmp.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway if I read your email correctly, you wanted me to try to start riak
&gt; and then after it reports failure, try to attach to it:
&gt;
&gt; [07-16 11:55] (master)~/Dev/prodar
&gt; ! riak-1.1.4/bin/riak start
&gt; Riak failed to start within 15 seconds,
&gt; see the output of 'riak console' for more information.
&gt; If you want to wait longer, set the environment variable
&gt; WAIT\\_FOR\\_ERLANG to the number of seconds to wait.
&gt;
&gt; [07-16 11:56] (master)~/Dev/prodar
&gt; ! riak-1.1.4/bin/riak attach
&gt; Node is not running!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Not sure if any logs would be interesting to look at after this.
&gt; Interestingly, riak does seem to be running, as basic REST stuff seems to
&gt; work OK (using Ruby + Ripple).

&gt;&gt; Well, from the logs it looks like a normal and successful startup...
&gt;&gt; consistent with the fact that a riak process continues to exists.
&gt;&gt; And the startup does not seem to be slow (which would cause a timeout for
&gt;&gt; the script waiting for the node to come up); from logging starts to the node
&gt;&gt; is ready takes just 2s.
&gt;&gt; It then remains to be determined why the start script reports timeout.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Either it can't connect to the node, or the check it attempts to make
&gt;&gt; within the node (whether an Erlang process called 'riak\\_core\\_node\\_watcher'
&gt;&gt; is registered) never succeeds.
&gt;&gt; Have you tried attaching to the node, using "riak attach"? That would
&gt;&gt; check which of the two things fail.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The pipe files are usually called things like
&gt;&gt; /tmp/riak/erlang.pipe.2.r
&gt;&gt; (they exist in pairs: one to and one from the node).

&gt;&gt; Hi Erik!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the suggestions. I checked out /tmp but didn't see anything
&gt;&gt; that looked like a pipe for riak... perhaps could you tell me what the file
&gt;&gt; would be named?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Not sure which logs would be most useful, but please find everything that
&gt;&gt; was generated attached.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; If I remember correctly, this may be a symptom that the pipe file on /tmp
&gt;&gt; which Riak wants to use does already exists but is owned by another user.
&gt;&gt; This happens if Riak has previously been run by a different user.
&gt;&gt; If it's not that, I suggest you provide the logs from the failed "riak
&gt;&gt; start" attempt for further diagnosis...
