Hello all,

Wanted to say that John Mullerleile and I will be giving a talk on 
high-volume, high-availability technologies at http://showyou.com. We'll 
discuss building an application with Riak, Solr, distributed queuing, 
and metrics, and present some new open-source tools we've built to 
tackle these problems.


We're offering free food and drinks, plus you get to hang out with other 
riakers after.


When: Monday, September 26th, 2011
 7-10 PM

Where: 48 Gold St (Right next to Bix)
 San Francisco, CA 94133
