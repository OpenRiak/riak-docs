Btw, this whole issue is not really Riak specific. It is essentially a
consequence of eventual consistency, where you have to make a trade off
between the amount of bookkeeping information you want to store and the
maximum amount of time (or number of updates) any part of the system can
diverge from the rest of the system before you get undesired results.


The 'eventual consistency' description makes you think the system will 
eventually fix itself, though. But, won't you have a similar scenario - 
and even more difficult to fix - where for one reason or another you 
need to restore a backed up bitcask file that contains items deleted 
after the time the backup was done?
