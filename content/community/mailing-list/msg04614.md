I feel compelled to share a bit of praise:

The TestServer functionality in the python client is absolutely the
coolest thing since sliced bread. Up until now, I've been using an
abomination of a fakeriak library that exposed an identical interface to
python-riak, but was backed entirely by Python dictionaries (shelling
out to node.js to handle map-reduce calls and whatnot). I'm really
happy that I can bury that now, so whoever wrote that: Thank you so
much! :)
