Hi Mridul,
 You can use filterNotFound from mapred\\_builtins.js...
 usage format in reduce phase:
 return Riak.filterNotFound(your\\_object\\_passed \\_from\\_map\\_phase);

Thanks,
Venkatesh

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I'm a beginner with Riak and map-reduce in general.
&gt;
&gt; I was trying a function in map reduce which sorts the data and returns it.
&gt; It works well when all the bucket key pairs in input query exist in the
&gt; riak cluster. When a bucket/key pair does not exist, it gives an output
&gt; like below.
&gt;
&gt;


&gt;
&gt; [{"not\\_found":{"bucket":"newspaper-issue","key":"56276","keydata":"undefined"}}]
&gt;
&gt; I'm not able to remove this output from the map phase, even when I just
&gt; return [] in the map phase, it returns this single object.
&gt;
&gt; My question is how can I avoid this output as it is likely that in the
&gt; inputs there is some bucket/key missing.
