Hi Rusty,

This is what I got when use \\* in file name:

[r...@sft riaksearch]# bin/search-cmd solr testwiki /root/DATA/output/\\*.xml

Usage:

 search-cmd set\\_schema [INDEX] SCHEMAFILE : Set schema for an index.
 search-cmd show\\_schema [INDEX] : Display the schema for an index.
 search-cmd shell [INDEX] : Start the interactive Search 
shell.
 search-cmd search [INDEX] QUERY : Perform a search.
 search-cmd search\\_doc [INDEX] QUERY : Perform a document search.
 search-cmd explain [INDEX] QUERY : Display an execution plan.
 search-cmd index [INDEX] PATH : Index files in a path.
 search-cmd delete [INDEX] PATH : De-index files in a path.
 search-cmd solr [INDEX] PATH : Run the Solr file.
 search-cmd install BUCKET : Install kv/search integration 
hook
 search-cmd uninstall BUCKET : Uninstall kv/search integration 
hook
 search-cmd test PATH : Run a test package

If I give only path like bin/search-cmd solr testwiki /root/DATA/output/ 
than its ok.

Regards

Prometheus

&gt; Hi Prometheus,
&gt; 
&gt; Can you tell me the exact error that it gives?
&gt; 
&gt; Wildcard matching should work as follows (taken from the library 
&gt; documentation):
&gt; 
&gt; The wildcard string looks like an ordinary filename, except that certain 
&gt; "wildcard characters" are interpreted in a special way. The following 
&gt; characters are special:
&gt; 
&gt; ?
&gt; Matches one character.
&gt; 
&gt; \\*
&gt; Matches any number of characters up to the end of the filename, the next dot, 
&gt; or the next slash.
&gt; 
&gt; {Item,...}
&gt; Alternation. Matches one of the alternatives.
&gt; Other characters represent themselves. Only filenames that have exactly the 
&gt; same character in the same position will match. (Matching is case-sensitive; 
&gt; i.e. "a" will not match "A").
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; Rusty

&gt; Hi Rusty ,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; I already tried. :) but it give error and trying to teach me sytnax as in 
&gt; help :) 
&gt; 
&gt; It is accepting : bin/search-cmd solr testwiki /root/DATA/output/ 
&gt; 
&gt; but gives error for : 
&gt; 
&gt; bin/search-cmd solr testwiki /root/DATA/output/\\*.xml 
&gt; 
&gt; As you aware We are trying to do some benchmark test on riaksearch. We have 
&gt; customers have billions of doc. Working with current lucene / Solr is a 
&gt; operational nightmare ( yes it is).
&gt; 
&gt; So we are looking for a replacement for those customers. This is why we are 
&gt; one of the early tester of the RiakSearch. 
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards

&gt;&gt; Hi Prometheus,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Yes, you can either put the files into a directory and then provide a 
&gt;&gt; command line pointing to the directory, ie:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; bin/search-cmd solr index path/to/directory
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Or you can specify a wildcard using '\\*':
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; bin/search-cmd solr index path/to/directory/\\*.xml
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Best,
&gt;&gt; Rusty

&gt;&gt; Hi ,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is there anyway to submit more than one file in :
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; "search-cmd solr INDEX abc.xml ? "
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; it is not accepting \\*.xml or 1.xml 2.xml in the same command line..
