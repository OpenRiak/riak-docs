Hi Bryan,

Thank you for your answer, that is what I was looking for at first ! 

Why would you think that fetch both user and look through the links is fastest 
than A -&gt; B -&gt; A ? Are links really that slow ?

Thanks,

Morgan.

&gt; Hi, Morgan.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1 - Are Link walking in Erlang fast & easy ?
&gt; 
&gt; Link-walking in the Erlang client is provided via the MapReduce
&gt; interface. Instead of a 'map' or 'reduce' phase, specify a 'link'
&gt; phase like:
&gt; 
&gt; {link, Bucket, Tag, Keep}
&gt; 
&gt; Bucket is either a binary name of a bucket to match, or the atom '\\_',
&gt; which matches any bucket. Tag is either a binary tag to match, or the
&gt; atom '\\_', which matches any tag. Keep is a boolean with the same
&gt; meaning as in map and reduce phases.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2 - Is it possible to check fast if A -&gt; B -&gt; A (still in Erlang)? ('-&gt;' 
&gt;&gt; represents Links)
&gt; 
&gt; The fastest way to do this is to fetch both A and B and look through
&gt; the links they contain.
&gt; 
&gt; HTH,
