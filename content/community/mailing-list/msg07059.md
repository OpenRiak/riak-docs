&gt;&gt; Awesome. Grats on the release and all the hard work that went into it. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1. I heard differing things when I asked in other forums but I wanted to get 
&gt;&gt; an answer here, does Riak CS support range requests? Aka give me bytes 
&gt;&gt; 100-200 from this 3MB file. 
&gt; 
&gt; As Reid Draper said on HN, yes it does support range queries.

I got a DM from someone else at Basho that said otherwise. 

&gt;&gt; 2. Pricing. Is Riak CS priced like S3 in terms of storage volume, bandwidth 
&gt;&gt; and lookups?
&gt; 
&gt; Pricing is per-node. I believe you can cram as many CPUs, drives and RAM
&gt; info a node as you want and pay the same flat per-node price.

That's awesome. My own private S3 or someone else will host one for me.

Thanks!
