Have tried shoehorning this into a 1.0.2 . The github docs seem to assume
you already know how to extend risk, and I don't.

Even without a t-shirt bribe :) am still curious what I'm missing here. https
listener is up, but I don't have anything under /admin (and riak

have got rebar to build the riak\\_control project, copied the built project
into the lib/ folder within the riak installation

(
riak-1.0.2:$ ls -d lib/r\\*
lib/riak\\_control lib/riak\\_kv-1.0.2 lib/riak\\_search-1.0.2 
lib/riakc-1.2.0
lib/riak\\_core-1.0.2 lib/riak\\_pipe-1.0.2 lib/riak\\_sysmon-1.0.0 
lib/runtime\\_tools-1.8.5
riak-1.0.2:$
)
 and added a block to my app.config
(between the riak\\_core and riak\\_kv config blocks, see below) but the
module isn't loading up
after I stop/start the node:

riak-1.0.2:$ ./bin/riak-admin status | grep riak\\_control

is there an extra step?

...
...
 {platform\\_log\\_dir, "./log"}
 ]},

%% riak control bit
{riak\\_control, [
 {enabled, true},
 {auth, none},
 {admin, true}
 ]},

 %% Riak KV config
 {riak\\_kv, [
 %% Storage\\_
...
...
