Thank you but this command didn't return anything:


OK, perhaps you're using the same port for different functions in Riak?

In particular, I see you're using 8099 for your http port but in my 
setup 8099 is used for "handoff\\_port".


Here's the ports I'm using:

pb\\_port, 8087
http, 8098
handoff\\_port, 8099

Make sure all three (four if you're also using "https") are on different 
ports.


Shane.
