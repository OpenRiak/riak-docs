Hi all,

I remember a previous discussion in the mailing-list about
doing mapreduce over an entire bucket
'{"inputs":"products","query":[...]}' being very slow independently of
how many items that bucket would have stored in as Riak would have to
scan all memory in search for the keys, etc... so... how about secondary
indexes? are they a good alternative? faster? slow too?

if I want to
get all products with category "sport" using secondary indexes like
this:
http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8098/buckets/products/index/category\\_bin/sport
=&gt;
{"keys": ["productA","productB",...,"productN"]}

Will the keys array
come in an speed-decent result? or wouldn't it be recommended? 
Thanks,

Rohman
