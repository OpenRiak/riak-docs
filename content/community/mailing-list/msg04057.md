It sounds like there is a typo, I would assume that it should be "the
input of later evaluations will include the output of earlier
evaluations". It's not really a reduction otherwise.

&gt; Hello,

&gt; I see the following on the Basho wiki for Riak [1]:
&gt;
&gt;  The important thing to understand is that the function defining the
&gt; reduce phase may be evaluated multiple times, and the input of later
&gt; evaluations will include the input of earlier evaluations.
&gt;  For example, a reduce phase may implement the set-union function. In
&gt; that case, the first set of inputs might be [1,2,2,3], and the output
&gt; would be [1,2,3]. When the phase receives more inputs, say [3,4,5],
&gt; the function will be called with the concatentation of the two lists:
&gt; [1,2,3,4,5].
&gt;
&gt; This description isn't clear to me as the behavior I'm seeing is that
&gt; the \\_output\\_ of earlier evaluations is included as input to later
&gt; evaluations. Unfortunately, the example yields the same results
&gt; irrespective of whether it is the input or the output of the first
&gt; evaluation, so it doesn't clear anything up.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
