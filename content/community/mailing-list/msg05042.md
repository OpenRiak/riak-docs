Ah. Yeah. Quite true.

&gt; &gt; Avoiding two services on one machine (e.g web + riak) is also much
&gt; &gt; easier to manage/maintain. Just have web machines and riak machines.
&gt;
&gt; I disagree; it's more work to maintain two machines correctly. However
&gt; the extra work is worth it for security/scalability.

Note that his original description had two machine types: web+riak, and
riak-only. My point was about that two service box being a pain. Given that
you have two types, then break up the boxes into the two -only formats and
increase your security.
