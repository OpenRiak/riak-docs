PS: it seems like 0.9.4 has been removed from all the default gem
repos so you can't easily downgrade once you've made the mistake of
upgrading.

&gt; Looking at the code in the gem I see client.rb has no search
&gt; functionality at all, nor does map\\_reduce.rb. search.rb looks like an
&gt; alternative version of client.rb with all the search functionality but
&gt; I don't see how it's used.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally all my .search mapreduce inputs no longer work. Is there
&gt; any documentation on how it has changed in 0.9.5? I didn't see
&gt; anything in the readme for 0.9.5 talking about this either
&gt;
