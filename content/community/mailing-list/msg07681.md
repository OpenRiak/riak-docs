Hi Jeff,

Dynos on Heroku don't have access to any permanent disk storage. They can
read and write to /tmp, but that is not guaranteed to stick around.

Dynos are also restricted to only accept HTTP connections. This would rule
out any ProtocolBuffer connections.


&gt; Curious if anyone is able to use clustered nodes on Heroku using the
&gt; Erlang buildpack [1]? Seems like it should at least be theoretically
&gt; possible to launch new dynos that become part of your node cluster. How
&gt; reliable/easy/hard is node communication on EC2?
