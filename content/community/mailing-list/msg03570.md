&gt; Hey All -
&gt; 
&gt; Quick question: how would you feel if we turned the Riak Recap into a blog?
&gt; 
&gt; I've spoken with various people in various channels about how to best
&gt; deliver the Recap, and while it's clear that it's a valuable tool for
&gt; the community, I'm not sure the Mailing List is still the best vehicle
&gt; through which to publish it.
&gt; 
&gt; Publishing it as a blog (perhaps at "recap.basho.com 
&gt; (http://recap.basho.com)") makes a lot of
&gt; sense as it would enable people to consume it without having to sift
&gt; through the rest of the mailing list traffic (and I know there are
&gt; more than a few of you who are on this ML only for the Recaps). More
&gt; importantly, I think it would bring more new readers to the Recap (and
&gt; more users to Riak).
&gt; 
&gt; So, in the interest of convenience and expanding the size of the Riak
&gt; community, I think making it a blog might make sense. It would still
&gt; be written, published, and tweeted thrice weekly, just delivered to
&gt; you in your Reader, for example, instead of on the ML.
&gt; 
&gt; As you all are the primary consumers of the Recap, I thought I would
&gt; gather some opinions before I did anything drastic. Anyone have
&gt; thoughts on this?
&gt; 
&gt; +/-1s, rants, and all other expressions of opinion are encouraged.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
