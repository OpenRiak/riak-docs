Hi Ryan,

I had an incident when removing a replica back in November. But then I
managed to fix the state of the cluster. Then in December I passed the
script to re-save all docs so it worked (i.e. documents matched), and
now in January we were still noticing discrepancies.

I noticed the problem only twice, perhaps it did happen more often.
Avg load is way under control, no spikes, no faulty disks. The cluster
hasn't changed at all since November.

&gt; Typically, something like this would be caused by replicas being lost as
&gt; Search currently has no anti-entropy.  I imagine you would have mentioned
&gt; replica loss if that was the case, though.  You've seen this problem at
&gt; least twice, correct?  Were there other occurrences?  If so how many and
&gt; about how often do you notice them?  Did any other system events happen that
&gt; might be correlated such as spike in load, faulty disks, node
&gt; join/leave/remove, node down/up, etc.

&gt;&gt; &gt; When you say "doesn't show up on the search query results \\*anymore\\*"
&gt;&gt; &gt; does
&gt;&gt; &gt; that imply that at one time they did?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. As a matter of fact that's what some of my users were
&gt;&gt; asking: "why can't I see X anymore?".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  I'm trying to understand if the index
&gt;&gt; &gt; entries appear to have been lost or if it was never successfully written
&gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; the first place.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; They are definitely written to the index in the first place. I recall
&gt;&gt; noticing a similar situation early December, where I compared item
&gt;&gt; counts from a full-bucket map/reduce vs. a search map/reduce and they
&gt;&gt; didn't match.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Went about it by re-saving all items in the bucket as I said before.
&gt;&gt; Did a check just after, and numbers matched.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And this morning I was back to the inequality after a user complaint,
&gt;&gt; so passed the re-save script once again. Obviously this is not
&gt;&gt; sustainable.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The curious thing is that those documents are not even regularly
&gt;&gt; updated or deleted.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Any errors you see in the logs may be relevant.  Feel free to include
&gt;&gt; &gt; snippets of anything you find.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I went through all sasl-error.log from all 3 nodes and couldn't find
&gt;&gt; anything related to search. Where else could I look? Do you have any
&gt;&gt; idea what could be causing this behaviour?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I am running (still) 0.14.2 in production, and using Riak Search to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; index certain buckets. Those buckets have the Riak Search pre-commit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hook enabled.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Once in a while I get complaints of missing documents from my clients,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and it just happened.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I checked and the document:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  - is correctly stored in Riak
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  - doesn't show up on the search query results \\*anymore\\*
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My workaround before was to go through every key in the bucket and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; save it again, as to trigger the search hook. Of course, this is less
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; than ideal.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Should I be looking for something specific in the logs? What could be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; going on here?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
