Are there any early release notes available as well, regarding specific new
features (high profile or not) that we should pay special attention to, or
possible compatibility issues with upgrading from 0.14.x to 1.0 PR, or
compatibility issues with any map/reduce functionality, or compatibility
with existing clients?

I'm not saying that there are or should be issues, but it seems like a
fairly major version jump, so I want to make sure there aren't any "wow, you
should've realized X had changed" types of issues :-)

Also, any plans for getting the 1.0 final release into package manager
repos? (i.e. - apt-get for Debian, for instance)

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I'm proud to announce that we're taking the first steps towards
&gt; releasing Riak 1.0 with the creation of the 1.0 branch and initial
&gt; package builds. With 1.0, we will be doing two series of builds before
&gt; the final release.
&gt;
&gt; The first stage is "pre-release" (aka PR) builds that represent the
&gt; feature-complete Riak 1.0, with minor cleanup and tweaks still
&gt; ongoing. You WILL find some rough edges with packaging and the
&gt; features -- we're still working through these and will do pre-releases
&gt; as often as necessary to get these issues resolved. We'll also be
&gt; trying to incorporate outstanding pull requests where change is
&gt; minimal/manageable.
&gt;
&gt; The second stage is "release candidate" (aka RC) builds that represent
&gt; what we believe to be a solid product, suitable for release. Once we
&gt; hit this stage, only major, show-stopping bugs will be addressed.
&gt;
&gt; We would love to get your feedback on these builds, good or bad. We're
&gt; trying this new process to do a better job of incorporating community
&gt; feedback BEFORE the release. :) If you run into issues, please drop us
&gt; a line on the ML or in IRC -- we'll do our best to stay on top of it.
&gt; If you'd like to file bugs, we ask you do a check of bugzilla to avoid
&gt; creating duplicate issues. Also note that the docs on wiki.basho.com
&gt; may still reflect 0.14.2; we'll be addressing those over next few
&gt; weeks.
&gt;
&gt; It goes without saying that you should think twice before running a PR
&gt; or RC in production. :)
&gt;
&gt; So, without further ado:
