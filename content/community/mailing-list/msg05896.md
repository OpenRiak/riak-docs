Hey everyone, I'm sure this has been asked before but I was wondering what
other people are doing for pooling clients using python?
I've noticed that HttpPoolTranport is deprecated, and there doesn't seem to
exist an analogous PBuffers version.
I could just go ahead and write my own, but I thought that something must
exist.

I'm a relative Riak novice, and as such, am probably not grasping some of
the difficulties involved in it implementation.
