I'm using Riak Search 0.14.0-1, and it seems like JSON docs with otherwise
legal \\r characters in them confuse both the search indexer and JSON.parse()
from within JavaScript map functions. Presumably these two are related.

After looking around, it sounds like maybe this has been fixed, but perhaps
not yet in release builds. Is it really the case that Riak isn't yet using
the native JSON parse from spidermonkey, or is something else going on here?
