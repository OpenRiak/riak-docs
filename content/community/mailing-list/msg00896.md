Riak Recap for 8/13 - 8/15

1) Andy Gross spoke at Devnation this past weekend in San Francisco on
Riak Core. It was a great presentation and the slides are well worth
it.

On slideshare here ---&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/argv0/riak-coredevnation

On the Riak Wiki here ---&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Slides

2) Rackspace mentioned Riak in a blog post entitled, "Alternative
Database Technology for the Cloud: There is No Silver Bullet."

3) We announced a new Webinar for this coming Thursday. This one will
be driven by Basho Engineering Manager Bryan Fink (@hobbyist) and will
cover "Wriaki", an example implementation of a wiki that stores its
data in Riak.

Details and registration here ---&gt;

4) Q --- Anyone using Riak for file storage? As a MogiFS replacement?
(from @tobi via twitter)

 A --- Check out Riakfuse from Artur Bergman over at Wikia ---&gt;
http://github.com/crucially/riakfuse

5) Looks like @technoweenie and @frank06 decided to forego sleep this
past weekend and spent some major time hacking on riak-js.

Long list of changes here ---&gt; http://bit.ly/bBOtE2

6) archaelus asked, "Is there a riak\\_core hello world example
somewhere I can look at?"

Short Gist of the resulting conversation here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/527318

7) Q --- Does the Riak pbc client support the new symbolic r/n/w
values? (from technoweenie via #riak)

 A --- The new symbolic values are supported in tip, but it has not
yet been tagged, which means it hasn't been extensively tested. Try at
your own risk and let us know if you come across any bugs.

8) Q --- Is there an example somewhere that first puts some data in
riak and then map-reduces it? (from tomtt via #riak)

 A --- Part four of the Riak Fast Track provides sample data and
MapReduce jobs to run on it.

 Check it out here ---&gt;

9) sh1mmer kicked off a short but worthwhile convo in #riak by asking
"how does [riak] core compare to web workers?"

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/527365

10) Q --- Has anyone got experience with making Rails work with object
ids that contain periods? Such as email addresses, for example? I'm
finding I need to encode the . as %252E so that rails doesn't see the
period when I use the id in a URL, which is fine, but then when I use
the id with ripple I have to CGI::encode it. Would love to have a way
to automate it with Ripple so that I don't have to encode it by hand
whenever I want to use the id.

 A --- There's a recent change in ripple edge to CGI-encode the
keys instead of URI-encode them. Unfortunately you can't change
Rails' default resource routes to exclude or ignore the format.
However, you could potentially join the id and format params with a
"." Or create your own custom route.
