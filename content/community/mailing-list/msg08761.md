Hi Mridul,
 You can use filterNotFound from mapred\\_builtins.js...
 usage format in reduce phase:
 return Riak.filterNotFound(your\\_object\\_passed \\_from\\_map\\_phase);

Thanks,
Venkatesh

 Hi,

 I'm a beginner with Riak and map-reduce in general.

 I was trying a function in map reduce which sorts the data and
 returns it. It works well when all the bucket key pairs in input
 query exist in the riak cluster. When a bucket/key pair does not
 exist, it gives an output like below.


 
[{"not\\_found":{"bucket":"newspaper-issue","key":"56276","keydata":"undefined"}}]

 I'm not able to remove this output from the map phase, even when I
 just return [] in the map phase, it returns this single object.

 My question is how can I avoid this output as it is likely that in
 the inputs there is some bucket/key missing.
