After looking a bit more into this, I am not sure changes in just one
client are warranted. Apparently most of the JSON encoders muck about
and force everything into ASCII by default, for legacy reasons. In
fact, Ruby didn't seem to have a way to configure the encoder in any
other way, according to http://flori.github.com/json/, although the
documentation in the actual github repo now states otherwise. And PHP
added that flag to the JSON encoder only in the last version.

As far as Python goes, there is an easy way to change the default
encoder, using set\\_encoder, so Adam's solution will do the job and
explicit is probably better than implicit, as usual.

Maybe an article in the documentation explaining all this is a better idea?
