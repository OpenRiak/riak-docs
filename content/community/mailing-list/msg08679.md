I forgot to mention that in our company we are using a different POM, 
for example, Jackson at version 1.9.9 and HttpClient at version 4.1.3, 
you could force your POM file to overwrite those versions, you could 
also try to get the source from github, upgrade the POM dependencies to 
your needs, do a maven clean test and if tests pass then you are good to 
go with your own version requirements.

Guido.

Deepak,

 I think that was fixed on the following pull request but, you would 
have to compile your own client from github which is easy; or, did you 
get the new 1.0.6? I'm not sure if it is already available at maven 
repos, anyways, there is a lot going on in the riak client in java, I 
would suggest you to keep an eye on the github, many good bugs getting 
fixed quickly.

Hi,

My servers complain about a leaky apache DateUtils class during hot 
deployments. This is a known bug 
 in http 4.1.x 
and has been fixed in 4.2.x. Can the next version of riak-client be 
updated to include the newer HTTP client (the current version is 
4.1.1 ) ? Is the riak-client compatible with httpclient 4.2.x as it is ?


Thanks
Deepak Bala
