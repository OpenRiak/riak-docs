For those that are interested I have created (yet another) Go client using 
protobuf for Riak. It can be found here: https://github.com/tpjg/goriakpbc

I realize there are other efforts (like github.com/mrb/riakpbc) and was 
actually hoping Airbrake would open source their client 
(http://blog.airbrake.io/status/planned-airbrake-migration-love-go-love-riak/) 
but can't wait for that.

I have started a library that takes inspiration from the Ruby client library 
(https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client) and plan to implement only those 
functions that I need to port a part of my Ruby on Rails application to Go. So 
far simple get and store operations as well as setting some bucket properties 
are implemented.

Kind regards,
Timo
