Hello,

I am developing a web feed reader, with Riak as the database. While i 
have read a few examples about designing schemas in Riak, i have come up 
with an idea about this but i dont feel very confident.


Its quite simple, there are Users, Feeds, and Articles. User logs in, 
sees feeds he is subscribed to, chooses one, and watches articles of 
that feed. The further he scrolls down, more feeds are fetched.


The schema i came up with is the following

\\* User is a JSON object with his credentials, and a list of keys to 
feeds he is subscribed to.


\\* Feeds are JSON objects with the basic information about the feed, 30 
Links to the most recent articles, and another Link to an object 
containing Links to the next 30, and so on.


\\* Articles are JSON objects with meta info about the feed and a Link to 
a raw object containing the actual content (ok, this might be embedded 
in the json object)


Do you think this is the right way to go? Can you think of other designs 
with pros/cons?


Thank you,
danmilon.
