&gt;&gt; BTW, are there any plans for the Riak python client to use the protobuf C 
&gt;&gt; library directly via ctypes? The pure python implementation of protobuf 
&gt;&gt; seems a little slow.

&gt; Not that I've seen. I plan to use the HTTP interface because I can
&gt; encrypt it, and I can avoid MitM attacks. That isn't possible with the
&gt; protobuf interface. I think you'll need to find somebody that deploys
&gt; heavy use of the protobuf interface to be interested enough to improve
&gt; its speed.

There should be an SSL option for Riak with protobufs, perhaps on an alternate 
port. No reason to go to http just to get SSL.

&gt; Note that I've sped up the Python HTTP transport. It is definitely
&gt; faster (via persistent connections), but I haven't done a comparison
&gt; against protobufs yet. Basho has a benchmarking tool that I might try.

I wonder if gzip encoding would also help for larger keys/values?
