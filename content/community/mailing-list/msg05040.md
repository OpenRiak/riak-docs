&gt; Regarding security: it is the same for option A and B and C (you're

Not quite the same. If you get rooted on a webhead you don't want your
data there (esp with an erl shell.)

&gt; Avoiding two services on one machine (e.g web + riak) is also much

I disagree; it's more work to maintain two machines correctly. However
the extra work is worth it for security/scalability.
