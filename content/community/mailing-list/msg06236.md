Les, 

In Riak, there is no single primary copy considered the canonical version. For 
each key, there will be N (3 by default) partitions responsible for storing the 
associated value. In effect, there are N primaries for any key. This is how 
Riak makes its availability guarantees, as well as why "absolute consistency" 
is difficult.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How do things like mongo and elasticsearch manage atomic operations

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Most such systems use some variant of primary copy replication, also known 
&gt; &gt; as master/slave replication.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That approach can provide consistency, but has much weaker availability 
&gt; &gt; properties.
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't riak need some kind of partition owner/master concept to
&gt; control migration? And if it has that, why can't the client request
&gt; that an operation happens on the partition owner/master first for
&gt; things that need consistency?
