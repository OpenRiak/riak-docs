Of you're parsing in a js map reduce in Riak that it's bring done via
spider monkey engine. I have a blog post on parsing dates in js via
different engines. Check mah blog. I'm on a plane.

&gt; I was struggling with this as well. I would get proper dates in a JS test
&gt; console, but the exact same function under Riak would yield null dates.

&gt;&gt; http://codepad.org/sT0E5ch5 Here is the resulting array:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; [{"description":"","signed-in\\_date":"07-20-2012","signed-in\\_time":"9:43
&gt;&gt; pm","date-time":null},{"description":"","signed-in\\_date":"07-20-2012","signed-in\\_time":"9:41
&gt;&gt; pm","date-time":null}] Â­
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For example, it's trying to parse this date/time: "2012-07-20T21:41:00",
&gt;&gt; but that just results in a null value. Like the "date-time" properties
&gt;&gt; above.
