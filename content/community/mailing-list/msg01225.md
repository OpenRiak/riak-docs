&gt; make\\_ref is 6 times faster than erlang:phash2(make\\_ref()) which is 50%
&gt; faster than erlang:phash2(now()).
&gt;
&gt; Of course, in the grand scheme of things this might not be your biggest
&gt; bottleneck, but why hashing now() when there exsists an idiomatic make\\_ref()
&gt; solution? Am I missing something?

You're not missing anything, I think. make\\_ref() seems like a logical
and reasonable alternative. As you said, however, it's not (anywhere
near) our biggest bottleneck -- last time I ran the profiler it didn't
even show up in the top 100 hotspots. :)

Thanks,
