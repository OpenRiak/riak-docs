Riak Recap for June 20 - 21
====================

1) Mathias Meyer and a few others put together an great overview of
Eventual Consistency and how it applies Riak for the Wiki.

\\* I highly suggest you read this ---&gt;
http://wiki.basho.com/Eventual-Consistency.html

2) JD Maturen shared some connection pooling code for the Python
client that he and the team at Formspring have been tinkering with.
There are rumors of an pull request...

\\* Check it out here ---&gt; ttp://twitter.com/#!/sku\\_/status/82956283627577344

3) We added an Erlang Pre-Commit Hook Function to Riak Function
Contrib that can be used to validate JSON before it makes it to Riak.

\\* Check it out here ---&gt; http://contrib.basho.com/validate\\_json\\_erl.html

4) We officially put some Riak Office Hours on the calendar at BashoWest.
