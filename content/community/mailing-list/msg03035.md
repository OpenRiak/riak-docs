&gt; &gt; I've only just started bumping into this problem, so I'm sure you guys
&gt; are a
&gt; &gt; bit ahead of me :-).
&gt;
&gt; I think you're about as far in as I am at this point, so not really.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; My biggest concern is getting the changes upstream so a port is not
&gt; &gt; necessary.
&gt;
&gt; Or at least make it so a port is trivial to create without a bunch of
&gt; custom patching.
&gt;
&gt;
Yes, ports are convenient when you can't get stuff upstream. At least
that's my feeling. Otherwise a port is still forever a kind of fork.

&gt; I'm going to spend 5 minutes and try the GNUMakefile trick and see if it
&gt; works.
