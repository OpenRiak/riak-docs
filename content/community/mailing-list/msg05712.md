Thanks Scott, 

I have managed to fix the problem ( getting different counts on keys) by 
resetting n=3 cluster just to me node and restoring from there afterwards.

&gt; No, those messages simply mean that the process had a single garbage
&gt; collection event that took 57 milliseconds. If you're doing a lot of
&gt; work on a lot of data, then the default settings in the etc/app.config
&gt; file may be too low. Edit the riak\\_sysmon section of that file and
&gt; revise the ceilings upward appropriately, particularly the gs\\_ms\\_limit
&gt; item, since that's the one that you might be seeing excessive
&gt; notifications. You may also want to change the heap\\_word\\_limit item,
&gt; also.
