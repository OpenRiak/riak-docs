&gt; \\* Given that the documents total ~1TB of storage (not including the

&gt; Mostly the documents are bulk inserted on a daily or weekly basis – other

The N replication factor determines reliability of the data. If you have
N=1, losing one node of the cluster means you have DEFINITELY lost data. On
the other hand, the value of raising N diminishes iteratively and begins to
waste resources. So it depends: if you don't care about losing data (e.g.
if you can just replace the missing documents), lower N as needed.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I'm currently in the process of evaluating solutions to index the contents
&gt; of ~1TB of SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) documents. File sizes
&gt; vary between a few KB to a couple hundred KB. I started evaluating Riak
&gt; first because ease of setting up and expanding a cluster are primary
&gt; requirements (ElasticSearch is also probably going to get evaluated, along
&gt; with Solr).
&gt;
&gt; Below I have a few specific questions that I was hoping people could help
&gt; with:
&gt;
&gt; \\* In going through the search querying documentation, I haven't
&gt; found a way to extract a section of a result containing matches. Something
&gt; similar to Google's search results page where you see an excerpt of the
&gt; webpage contents that match your query. Is something like this built-in so
&gt; that it doesn't have to be done by the application?
&gt; \\* Given that the documents total ~1TB of storage (not including the
&gt; generated indexes), does something like decreasing the n\\_val make sense?
&gt; Mostly the documents are bulk inserted on a daily or weekly basis – other
&gt; than that all of the operations are read-only.
&gt;
&gt; Other than these specific questions, if anyone can provide general insight
&gt; on issues that would arise from a dataset like this within Riak, please
&gt; feel free to mention them.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
