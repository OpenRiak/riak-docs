&gt; Actually, its worse than that because of some legacy behaviour. EDS
&gt; wants to know the bind IP, not a hostname, and it will exchange node IPs

&gt; other cluster and cause connection problems. There is a workaround for
&gt; this, and I do plan to address it.

That's problematic. We will be rolling out an EDS implementation in the
near future. One cluster will be in metal, but we are likely to place the
other on EC2, and we'd use elastic IPs and split horizon DNS.

When is this expected to be fixed?
