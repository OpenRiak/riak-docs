Hey everyone,

I'm currently using riak\\_kv as a reference of how to implement riak\\_core 
and see that whenever a new coordinator process is needed, a new one is 
created via their supervisor. But in the case of the get and put 
coordinators, the supervisor is not used.


Besides eliminating the supervisor as a potential bottleneck, is there 
any reason why the supervisor is not used?
