Hello Timo,

I recently played around with using secondary indexes instead of links, and
since I did not find any mapreduce functions that allowed me to follow 21
"links", I wrote a couple myself. These are available on my GitHub
accountand I also
submitted them to Basho Contrib yesterday for review.

Using secondary indexes to represent relationships will require the
mapreduce function to execute an index query, which will most likely be
slower than link walking, although it will as you stated be easier to
maintain due to the reduced number of records that need to be modified. As
you seem to have a quite deep hierarchy, maybe a mixture of links (for
records and relationships not changing often) and 2i "links" may work?

Best regards,

Christian
