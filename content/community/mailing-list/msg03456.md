Xinming Yao,

Yes, there will potentially be a period where not all nodes agree on the ring, 
which is why the `riak-admin ringready` command exists. However, in cases of 
nodes joining and leaving, the new ring is cast to all known nodes in the 
cluster, which helps speed convergence. Other ring changes, like bucket 
properties, do not have an explicit cast-to-all (at least, last time I looked), 
and so may propagate more slowly.
