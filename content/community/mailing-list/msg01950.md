Hi Eric,

The system expects that someone will run "search-cmd install BUCKET" before
storing data in the bucket. When that happens, deletes work fine. This
problem only seems to appear when somebody stores data in a bucket, \\*then\\*
sets the indexing flag, and \\*then\\* tries to delete some of the non-indexed
data.

This could be handled better by the system, though, and others have run into
this same problem, so I've filed a bug. Tracking here:
https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=970

Thanks for your email, and thanks for the detailed error message.

Best,
Rusty
