Hi Ross,

The comments in the app.config file should not prevent Riak from binding to
the web ip/port. As long as the parameter "web\\_ip" and "web\\_port" are
defined in the "riak\\_core" section of that file Riak should bind to the
specified ip/port. By default Riak will bind to "127.0.0.1" on port 8098.

Did you download the latest release (0.13)?
Can you provide the original and modified config files?

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Hey,

&gt; I found some time today to play around with Riak. Nice work guys,
&gt; seems like a great product so far.
&gt;
&gt; I downloaded the OSX distro, and started the node but the web
&gt; address/port was not bound. It turned out that I had to remove the
&gt; comments in the app.config in order for the configuration to work
&gt; properly. Wondered if this was a general issue or a local problem.
&gt;
