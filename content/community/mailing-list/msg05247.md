I'm trying to run a very simplified key filter that's timing out. I've got
about 8M keys in a 3-node cluster, 15 GB memory, num\\_partitions=256, LevelDB
backend.

I'm thinking this should be pretty quick. What am I doing wrong?

Here's the query:

curl -v -d 
'{"inputs":{"bucket":"nodes","key\\_filters":[["eq","user\\_id-xxxxxxx-info"]]},
"query":[{"reduce":{"language":"erlang","module":"riak\\_kv\\_mapreduce","functi
on":"reduce\\_identity"}}]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8098/mapred

Here's the log:
