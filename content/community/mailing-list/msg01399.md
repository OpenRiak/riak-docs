Hi Jon,

This is an often-requested feature that doesn't exist in the current Java
client - currently one needs to generate their own IDs.

Given the demand for this feature we'll likely implement it soon. I've
created a bugzilla issue to track this:

&gt; How do I get the ID when I want to store an object in Riak but let the

&gt; string to the RiakObject constructor. Neither seems to work (I get a 400
&gt; error back).
&gt;
&gt; I'm using the 0.11.0 java client against 0.12.0 server (from Homebrew on OS
&gt; X 10.6)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
