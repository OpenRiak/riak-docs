Walter,

There are three settings you can adjust in the riak app.config file that 
control the number of javascript vms: map\\_js\\_vm\\_count, reduce\\_js\\_vm\\_count, and 
hook\\_js\\_vm\\_count. If you are doing a lot of javascript mapreduce and seeing the 
error you mentioned, increase the map and reduce vm counts and that should help.

&gt; I saw a lot of messages like this in my riak log:

&gt; &lt;0.3681.19&gt;@riak\\_kv\\_js\\_manager:blocking\\_dispatch:246 JS call failed:
&gt; All VMs are busy
&gt;
