&gt; Hi Venki,

&gt; I know this email is about two months late, but I figured it was worth
&gt; responding to as I've had this response as a draft for the last 60 or
&gt; days or so. :)
&gt;
&gt; At any rate, it \\*looks\\* like you are (or were) hitting this:
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/issues/290
&gt;
&gt; It has been patched and will be fixed in the 1.3 release of Riak which
&gt; is slated for release towards the middle of January (if all goes to
&gt; plan).

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am getting the following error code from Riak when I execute my
&gt; map
&gt; &gt; reduce..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; {"phase":0,"error":"[timeout]","input":"{&lt;&lt;\\"20120708\\"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;\\"JM\\"&gt;&gt;}","type":"forward\\_preflist","stack":"[]"}
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This was happening from the past two days when my [bucket,key] count
&gt; &gt; went huge upto 40k...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I tried changing the q\\_limit value from 64 to 2000, but still no
&gt; affect
&gt; &gt; so far..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please help on the above..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Venkatesh
