 Does Riak Search support timestamps? The majority of my data is
 queried using timestamps; e.g. the last three hours of data or the
 snapshot from Jan 20th at 08:00:01 etc.


Mike, you can format the timestamp into ISO8601 basic:
[YYYY][MM][DD]T[hh][mm][ss]

This has the nice property of sorting in chronological order.

Is there any hope for a more natural concept of time 'ranges' in riak? 
Maybe some kind of indexing that would avoid the full bucket scan that 
you need even with a key prefix match?
