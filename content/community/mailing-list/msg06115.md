. riak\\_err prevents/minimizes SASL error dumps on the VM.
. lager is a logger.

There's no depencies between them:
https://github.com/basho/lager/blob/master/rebar.config
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_err/blob/master/rebar.config

Am I missing something?

&gt; What possible reason would you have to use \\*both\\* lager and riak\\_err on
&gt; the same project? Lager provides most, if not all, of riak\\_err's
&gt; featureset.
