assuming you are using bitcask. maybe you have too many keys so that
the single computer ram is being used up by both riak nodes, and there
isn't enough ram to hold them?

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; I've been successfully running component tests where I launch two Riak nodes
&gt; on the same computer and join them.
&gt; I'm trying to update my Riak version 0.12, but as soon as I join the nodes I
&gt; get a system\\_memory\\_high\\_watermark alarm and then both Riak instances crash.
&gt; Has anyone else experienced this?  Is there a workaround?
&gt; And yes, the nodes have different names.
&gt; Thanks,
