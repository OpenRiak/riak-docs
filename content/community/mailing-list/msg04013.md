Do you perhaps mean disk space instead of memory?

If so, and if you have left the N-val at the default of 3, then you
will need at least 60G of space before any other overhead is accounted
for.

&gt; Hey,
&gt; thank you a lot for your hints.
&gt; I have 20000000 records Ã  1KB. The key is a string like
&gt; "user123456789". I am using the default backend bitcask. There is just
&gt; one machine in the cluster and I didn't change the N-val. I already
&gt; tried to insert the 20GB of data, but 40GB of memory were obviously
&gt; not enough, because only 7000000 records were inserted. So I thought
&gt; mybe 150GB should be enough?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,

&gt;&gt; Hi, Maria.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In addition to what others have said, I would note that (at least) the
&gt;&gt; following issues matter quite a bit for such planning:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; - how many items the data is broken up into
&gt;&gt; - how large the keys will be (especially if they are very large due to
&gt;&gt; embedded structure)
&gt;&gt; - what storage engine ("backend") is in use
&gt;&gt; - how many machines are in the cluster
&gt;&gt; - the N-val, or how many replicas are being stored (default is 3)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you know those things, then you can make a more meaningful estimation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hope that this helps.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I would like to store 20GB of data with Riak. Does anyone know how
&gt;&gt;&gt; much memory Riak would need for that?
