Hi Ariel,

&gt; I'd like to be able to attach binary data to a Ripple Document object that
&gt; is being stored in a different bucket.

It looks like you can add any property to Ripple::Document [0]. Though
it doesn't seem to be documented (as far as I can tell), this could
certainly be a binary blob. (Just make sure said blob isn't much
bigger than 4MB or so.)

Also, since you mentioned it, someone released a Paperclip module for
Riak [1] about a month back.

Hope that helps.
