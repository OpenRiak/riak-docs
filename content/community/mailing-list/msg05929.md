Hi, Mat. Is your reduce phase implemented in Javascript? If so, it's
subject to a hardcoded five second timeout in erlang\\_js. Each
Javascript call a MapReduce query makes must finish in under five
seconds, regardless of the timeout set for the whole query. Phases
implemented in Erlang are not subject to this restriction.

HTH,
Bryan
