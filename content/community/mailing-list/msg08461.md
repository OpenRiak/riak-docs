forEach is a native javascript (ES5) method on Arrays.

Hi Brian,

Thanks for the quick reply. I might be missing here something, but I 
can't see any of the collection extension functions in any of the js 
files you mentioned. For example, where did you add the forEach method 
available on all arrays?


Thanks,
Shahar

 If not, where

 Hi, Shahar. The Javascript functions included with Riak are
 defined in
 a file named "mapred\\_builtins.js":
 https://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/blob/master/priv/mapred\\_builtins.js

 The functions in json2.js from the erlang\\_js project are also
 included: https://github.com/basho/erlang\\_js/blob/master/priv/json2.js
