We're still thoroughly in an ActiveRecord mindset over here. Before we go and 
build some simple collect statements to replace a few has\\_many :through 
statements, is there some Ripple or Riak goodness we should be using instead?

Example:

\\* A Publisher has many Authors who have many Books
\\* We want to get a set of books for a given publisher
\\* In ActiveRecord we would say:

# publisher.rb
class Publisher &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
 has\\_many :authors
 has\\_many :books, :through =&gt; authors
end

# author.rb
class Author &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
 belongs\\_to :publisher
 has\\_many :books
end

# book.rb
class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
 belongs\\_to :author
end

Thanks
