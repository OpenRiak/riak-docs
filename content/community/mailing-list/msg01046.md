John,

It sounds like you're assigning the key of the Address to the association on 
the Client. If these are in a one-to-one relationship, it would make more 
sense to me to store the Address inside the Client object. On the other hand, 
if you prefer them to be linked, load the Address in your controller before 
assigning it to the association.

I've also added an issue for \\*\\_keys accessor methods that should ease the 
linking up of independent objects. These would be similar to the \\*\\_ids methods 
that ActiveRecord provides. http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/issues/#issue/57
