Wilson,

This is indeed a bug. I filed a bug report on your behalf. Thanks for the
report.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I was trying out the wildcard search and i found out one interesting thing
&gt; that the wildcard search doesn't work when i specify only one character. Is
&gt; it a bug or is it some kind of protection mechanism to enforce faster
&gt; output.
&gt;
&gt; Say if I do
&gt; riakc\\_pb\\_socket:search(Pid, DB, "f\\_name:Wi\\*"),
&gt; it gives me all the keys with f\\_name starting with Wi.
&gt;
&gt; But if I do
&gt; riakc\\_pb\\_socket:search(Pid, DB, "f\\_name:W\\*"),
&gt; it gives me empty list.
