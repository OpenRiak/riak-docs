Dear List, 

Just wondering if there was already an s3 driver for basho\\_bench?
I found the LeoFS bansho\\_bench driver
https://github.com/leo-project/leofs/tree/master/test

But if you try this one on a real S3 implementation (so not LeoFS), 
it does not provide all needed headers 
For example the date header is not included when you do a get/put request,
only 

{'Content-Type', ?S3\\_CONTENT\\_TYPE}, {'Authorization', gen\\_sig("PUT", Url)} 

Are used in this driver.

I was just wondering if there exists already a kind of Amazon S3 driver for 
basho\\_bench?
