When you crash a riak\\_cord vnode with a console attached, what is the
expected behaviour (ba-dum, dump)?

I ran a riak\\_core vnode with some bad code (1/0) to cause a bad arith crash
in the FSM, initiated from the a console (via node "attach").

It crashed as expected, obviously, "\\*\\* State machine &lt;0.85.0&gt; terminating"
 Good.
The attached console was then hung. I could ^C and break out of it...but I
chose ^D to close the connection. Okay, now reattach.

I would expect that the vnode\\_master supervisor would have restarted the
FSM, as it's set to start\\_link in the supervisor's init.

However, when I reattached it was in a "dead" state. I could not execute
any command, including "2+2."
^C-q to quit out, reattach, node is down (obviously.)

Is this "hang status" because I took it down while a shell was attached, or
is there something else which may prevent the vnode\\_master from
restarted the crashed vnode/FSM?

Thanks!
