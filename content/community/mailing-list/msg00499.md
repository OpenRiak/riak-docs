Afternoon, Morning, Evening to all

Sadly, this will be my last day writing from Portland. I hardly knew you :(

Anyways, for today's recap : some new functionality to a fork of
riak.js and some knowledge from #riak.

Enjoy and have a great weekend.

Riak Recap for 6/2


1) @freshtonic added explicit support for making HTTP HEAD requests in
his fork of riak-js (via Twitter)

check it out here ----&gt; http://github.com/freshtonic/riak-js

2) Here is a quick little Gist from #riak about deleting embedded
documents via Ripple.

 Get at it here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/424318

3) crucially, justinsheehy and seancribbs had some words about pre and
post commit hooks and how/if they can be used for conflict resolution.

Check it out here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/424328
