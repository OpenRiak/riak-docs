&gt; Hi Bryan,
&gt; This is an excellent question and one of the more difficult areas of Riak to
&gt; understand. The source of confusion in this situation is vector clocks. Riak
&gt; maintains a vector clock for every object which is used to track different
&gt; versions of the object and potentially auto-repair out-of-sync data.
&gt; I recommend reviewing this page in the wiki:
&gt;
&gt; https://wiki.basho.com/Vector-Clocks.html

I actually had a question about that page. Why is it that when there
is a conflict we can only get the conflicting versions of the data?
If I'm going to try to resolve the conflict intelligently, I really
want the common ancestor as well so that I can try to do a 3-way
merge.
