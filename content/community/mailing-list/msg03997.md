I've got two 5 node riak-search rings. Both of them are using virtualized 2gb 
Ubuntu 10.04 VMs. One ring is on linode, the other is on rackspace. Both are 
identical binaries (14.2)

When I run search-cmd set-schema   on a machine on 
the linode ring, it returns nearly instantly.

When I run the same command on the other ring, I get a 30 to 40 second latency 
before it returns. In both cases the schema was already set and installed.

What could be causing the delay on the rackspace VM? Is it purely a VM 
performance issue, or is there something else going on.

Thanks!
