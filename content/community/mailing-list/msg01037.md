Yes, but the key size is very small and independent of the data size. 
Conservatively, you should be able to hold more than 18,000,000 keys within 4GB 
of RAM.

&gt;&gt; default other than the physical capacity of an individual node. 
&gt;&gt; Specifically, memory consumption per key discussed elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I see mentions of upper size suggestions on Riak database instances in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the small GB ranges. (2? 4?) Can one reasonably expect a Riak DB 
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; scale to a couple hundred terrabytes?
