I think I'm an idiot. I forgot that search is enabled per bucket and I am using 
my own bucket

&gt;&gt; I have a question about Riak search. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I installed Riak from brew. I enabled search shortly after. And to date, I 
&gt;&gt; have been able to search without issues. (Specifically, I am using Ripple, 
&gt;&gt; and was previously able to find things in stored keys in individual records.)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I deleted my database today using rm -rf on the data directory. I stopped 
&gt;&gt; Riak before the delete, and restarted after recreating that directory with 
&gt;&gt; mkdir. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Now, I cannot search. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As an aside, a colleague installed Riak from brew and has not been able to 
&gt;&gt; search ever, so we test against my machine, or did, until I broke search.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What do he and I need to do to enable search again? Configure something? 
&gt;&gt; Sacrifice a goat?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Please help!!!
