Not sure if it's a problem in PHP (and should go without saying), but make
sure to open a new connection when performing additional client requests
(like a delete) while receiving a streamed response. Otherwise you might run
into a case of "accidental concurrency" like I did (see also
http://seancribbs.com/tech/2011/03/08/how-ripple-uses-fibers/). If your
client has a proper connection pool/stack this should not be a problem.

&gt; Ah, nice. Checked the js client, which mentioned that ?keys=stream is a
&gt; valid option to result in streamed key listings.
&gt; I'll get that implemented in my PHP client, thanks for the pointer :-)

&gt;&gt; Depending on the client you're using, you can perform results streaming to
&gt;&gt; pull back results and process them in chunks rather than waiting for a
&gt;&gt; buffer to get filled.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's easy enough to write something like this using Ripple or
&gt;&gt; CorrugatedIron. I'm guessing it's possible with other clients.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I've read on the wiki that to delete a bucket, the only method is to
&gt;&gt; manually delete all keys within the bucket.
&gt;&gt; &gt; So then what is the recommended process for deleting all keys within a
&gt;&gt; bucket, manually?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I was initially just listing all keys within a bucket, and then
&gt;&gt; iterating the keys to send delete requests, but I hit a wall when I had too
&gt;&gt; many keys to get back in a list request (received header too large errors).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; So I assume the alternative would be to run a mapreduce to pull keys
&gt;&gt; from the bucket with a specified limit, to then execute the deletes?
&gt;&gt; &gt; While that's fine for an "active record" style environment (where there
&gt;&gt; may be cleanup actions that must occur per object being deleted), is there
&gt;&gt; another method for deleting all keys within a bucket, massively? (Maybe via
&gt;&gt; a map call?)
