It might not be perfect, but I spun up a VM + buildslave for fedora
and build an RPM this evening:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2596651/riak-0.14.0.18.gce2ab2c-1.fc13.i686.rpm

Maybe that works better? Or is at least functional? :)

&gt; Thanks David, I already had erlang-inets installed. I even tried

&gt;&gt; Try installing the erlang-inets package via yum.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's unfortunate they break up Erlang into so many tiny packages --
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what the rationale is for it (particularly in a
&gt;&gt; loosely-coupled language like Erlang).
