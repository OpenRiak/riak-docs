&gt; With your example of N=3, R=2 and W=2, if two clients are updating at the
&gt; same time to the same object, then it actually depends on the "allow\\_mult"
&gt; and "last\\_write\\_wins" variable.

Correct me if I am wrong, but the caveat here is that the R must be default
values for the bucket. The internal get performed by the coordinating node
handing the INM request does not actually use the R and W value of the INM
request. Correct?

It would seem advisable to change this behavior. Maybe the R value of the
internal get should match the W value of the INM request.
