Note that this is an HTTP limitation, not the datastore in general. That said, 
don't go crazy with them.

&gt; HA! I just ran into this limit!
&gt; 
&gt; 5,000 links like /tablet\\_users/whoever riaktag=following will cause your user 
&gt; objects to take upwards of 4 seconds to return, on our beefy cluster, with a 
&gt; variance of ~3 seconds. (Over HTTP, ruby riak\\_client.) I had to move them 
&gt; into the JSON body, which makes things much faster. Hundreds of links seems 
&gt; just fine.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Sorry for the Lil Kim reference on the subject line, I couldn't help it :-)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; In the links documentation on wiki.basho.com , it
&gt;&gt; says:
&gt;&gt; "this can substitute as a lightweight graph database, as long as the
&gt;&gt; number of links attached to a given key are kept reasonably low"
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What's considered reasonably low here? tens? hundreds? thousands? millions?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Has anyone published benchmarks or stress-testing results of this
&gt;&gt; anywhere for me to take a look?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thank you,
