&gt; 1. I'd like Riak to generate keys for some of my objects, and I'm

&gt; appear that object.store() actually reads and returns that key. Am I
&gt; missing something here? Maybe there is a Proper Way to do this?

You're right, it looks like this functionality was added without the
logic to pull the key back out of the response. It definitely should.

&gt; 2. The HTTP transport code doesn't use httplib properly at all. When I
&gt; wrote the httplib library, my primary design point was to enable
&gt; persistent, HTTP/1.1 connections. That was the whole idea behind
&gt; HTTPConnection. The transport library opens a \\*new\\* connection for
&gt; every request. I'm not surprised that the performance suffers, since a
&gt; TCP setup handshake needs to occur on every request. ... So: are there
&gt; any plans to rebuild the HTTP support to use persistent connections?

I believe I've read that Riak itself doesn't support keep-alive.
Someone else would have to comment for sure here. Regardless, this
feature would be handy because many people use Riak over HTTP through
a reverse proxy.

&gt; 3. The Luwak support reads the \\*entire\\* "file" into memory. My
&gt; understanding is that Luwak is for "large" files. If those files are
&gt; (say) a gigabyte, then the current code is going to impact clients in
&gt; a \\*very\\* bad way. I can see that the code wants to read the response,
&gt; then return the connection back to the pool... but that just isn't
&gt; workable. A connection needs to be held by the reader, which then
&gt; streams it to completion (or close), and only then should the
&gt; connection be returned. Now, if Luwak is defined for files less than
&gt; (say) 10 megabytes, then maybe this approach isn't wrong, but I
&gt; haven't seen any documentation about size limitations. Any thoughts on
&gt; this?

You're 100% right that it should spool to disk, Luwak is meant for
very large files.


The Python client has been pretty quiet in my experience (though I
only started messing with it about a month ago). I'm sure patches for
any/all of the above are welcome. I'm hoping the Basho guys have
someone on it to review pull requests and such sooner than later.
