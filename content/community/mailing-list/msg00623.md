See Riak as a plain k/v store for saving, and later apply map/reduce
for further analysis.

&gt; userId, partnerId, {products: [{productId: value, productName: value,
&gt; productPrice: value, productUrl: value, productDescription: value},
&gt; ...]}, orderId, date

For logging I would just make that a JSON object and save it.
Depending on your query patterns you would want to have a bucket per
partner, or a bucket for time slice. Search the mailing list, there
was a thread describing a similar use-case.

&gt; hello, i want to log this into a riak datastore but i am unsure how to
&gt; design the buckets:
&gt;
&gt; userId, partnerId, {products: [{productId: value, productName: value,
&gt; productPrice: value, productUrl: value, productDescription: value},
&gt; ...]}, orderId, date
&gt;
&gt; this basically is a log for when a user access a partner site, we have
&gt; about 35 partners and everytime user goes to the checkout page we want
&gt; to store this data to analyse later.
&gt;
&gt; any advise much appreciated.
