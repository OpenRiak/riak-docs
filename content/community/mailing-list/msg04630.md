&gt; The TestServer functionality in the python client is absolutely the
&gt; coolest thing since sliced bread. Up until now, I've been using an
&gt; abomination of a fakeriak library that exposed an identical interface to
&gt; python-riak, but was backed entirely by Python dictionaries (shelling
&gt; out to node.js to handle map-reduce calls and whatnot).  I'm really
&gt; happy that I can bury that now, so whoever wrote that: Thank you so
&gt; much! :)
