Hi,

I've got a riak\\_core application based on 0.13.0 that I'm updating to
riak\\_core 1.0. In the process, I thought I'd try moving it from framewerk
to rebar. For my initial attempt I used the riak\\_core template, but when I
tried to build a release with reltool I got the following error:

[root@rocky:experimental/freqserver]# rebar generate
==&gt; rel (generate)
{"init terminating in do\\_boot","Release freqserver uses non existing
application freqserver"}

This got me looking at the differences between the riak\\_core template and
the riak\\_core\\_multinode template. It looks like the riak\\_core template puts
src in the src/ dir (and doesn't include things like the handoff-handlers,
etc) while the multinode template puts src in apps/{{app\\_id}}/ and includes
more things. Could someone shed some light on when to use which template?
My application is currently deployed on more than one node (84 currently).

Thanks,
Joel
