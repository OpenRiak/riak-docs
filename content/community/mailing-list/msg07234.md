I'd buy the book on advanced usage of Riak. Also, I'd attend Basho
Chats in the EU.

&gt; At this point Riak has been deployed thousands of times. This is excellent,
&gt; but as you can imagine we here at Basho feel this is just the tip of the
&gt; iceberg. We want everyone to be running Riak. The software obviously needs
&gt; to solve enough problems for people to want to deploy it. However, we need
&gt; to get the software into developers' hands before this happens. Â So the
&gt; question is:
&gt;
&gt; What can we be doing better?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not talking so much about features in Riak itself. I'm more interested
&gt; in the other resources, tools, docs, processes, etc., that you think we need
&gt; to put in place or refine to take the Riak community from 1000s of users to
&gt; 100,000s of users. By virtue of being on this list, you've all spent some
&gt; time using or investigating Riak. As such, you're opinions and experiences
&gt; would be very valuable.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments, ideas, or thoughts you had would be great. On or off-list will
&gt; work.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your time. Long live the vnode!
