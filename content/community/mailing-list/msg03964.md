Phil,

This is a question best sent to the riak-users list. Recent changes in the
codebase necessitate an upgrade to rebar. In your source checkout, download
rebar from here: https://github.com/downloads/basho/rebar/rebar ... then
re-attempt the build.

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; Environment = CentOS 64bit 5.6

&gt; I've got working 13B04 (from source) + .14.2 ... no problems there.
&gt;
&gt; I've got a working 14B02 (from source) ... no problems there.
&gt;
&gt; I've cloned RIAK from github today. Have two problems while building:
&gt;
&gt; erlang\\_js ... need to modify Makefile to explicitly set --enable-64bit
&gt; eleveldb ... need to modify leveldb/Makefile to explicitly set -fPIC
&gt;
&gt; NOTE: When I pull the individual repos directly, they build fine. It's only
&gt; when pulling RIAK and rebar has done the get\\_deps process that I've got the
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; It seems that there are commits in either of the dependent repositories for
&gt; these fixes.
&gt;
&gt; I just don't know how rebar does it's dependency magic (yet) to understand
&gt; what commit it's pulling from github.
