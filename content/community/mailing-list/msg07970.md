Hi Lijun,

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Does anyone know if there is YCSB binding impl. for Riak?
&gt;

To my knowledge no one has written that code. (And If they have, it's not
yet been released.)

If your interest is just to benchmark Riak, and the tool to do it isn't the
primary concern, then you should take a look at Basho Bench [1]. That said,
if YCSB is what you're after, you might have some Java code in your future
(unless someone steps up with something they've written).

Hope that helps.
