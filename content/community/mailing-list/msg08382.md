plan to roll it out in staging soon. All our servera run sudo so we're
good. Didn't even notice that dep.

Bip,

In testing debian for another use, I went ahead and tested the Ubuntu
packages on Debian Squeeze. Our Ubuntu "natty" package installs cleanly
and works on Debian, with a needed dependency on 'sudo' which is not
installed by default on Debian.

Thanks,
Jared
