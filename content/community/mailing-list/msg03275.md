Riak Recap for May 04 - 05
====================

1) Basho Hacker Rusty Klophaus will be giving a "Getting Started with
Riak" talk at the Arlington/DC Erlang User Group on May 17.

\\* Details and registration info here ---&gt;
http://www.meetup.com/erlang/events/17550721/

2) Runar Jordan (@runarj) just posted a blog called "Why Riak."

\\* Read here ---&gt; http://blog.epigent.com/2011/05/why-riak.html

Thanks, Runar!

3) Verion 0.4.0rc2 of riak-js was just released, complete with new
code, bug fixes, and updated docs.

\\* All the details here ---&gt;

Also, @frank06 et al are actively looking for contributors on this
project, so if you want to get involved, shoot Francisco a message.

4) Sean Cribbs gave a Riak-js talk at NodeConf yesterday in Portland.

\\* Slides, code, and login credentials for a the sample app he used
during the talk are here ---&gt;

5) Eric Moritz released a new chunk of code yesterday called
"riak-streaming". This one is "an experimental project to attempt to
reproduce Hadoop Streaming with Riak" and is definitely worth a look.

Code is here on GitHub ---&gt; https://github.com/ericmoritz/riak-streaming

Thanks, Eric!

6) Alvaro Videla (@old\\_sound) just released an app called
"Rabbitmq-chat". Though it doesn't use Riak, it is inspired by Sean
Cribbs' "YakRiak", so I thought I would include it. I also happen to
know that Alvaro isn't the only Rabbit-MQ fan on this mailing list.

\\* Code here ---&gt; https://github.com/videlalvaro/rabbitmq-chat

7) One Job for today:

\\* Nerve.com in NYC is looking for a "Creative Web Developer" with Riak
experience. ---&gt;
