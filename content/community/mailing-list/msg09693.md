Hi all,

I'm saving logs like this:

{"transaction\\_type": "company","app\\_name": "app.posxml","started\\_at":
"2012/12/28
12:23:19","finished\\_at": "2012/12/28 12:23:26","serial\\_number":
"941-823-764","terminal\\_id": "474","framework\\_version": "3.53","status":
"timeout","sent": "3130504220202008000000010926155750100334380D","received
": "5676182745146776819287501928735143928376891D"}

I have created a schema for this bucket defining the started\\_at and
finished\\_at as date.

This is the result from a search, just to make sure the two fields are date:

\\*

20121228121940-MjAxMjEyMjgxMjE5NDA=117233
app.posxml
2012/12/28 12:19:40
3.50
5676182745146776819287501928735143928376891D
3130504220202008000000010926155750100334380D
158-271-426
2012/12/28 12:19:33
running
715
switch

\\*

I made a test changing the date, removing the "/" and ":", it works
perfectly using riak\\_search.

http://localhost:8098/solr/dg1\\_logs/select?q=started\\_at:[20121228122319 TO
20121228200000]

The thing is that I cannot change the way that the dates are saved, they
must have this format.

I'm trying to make this work:

http://localhost:8098/solr/dg1\\_logs/select?q=started\\_at:[2012/12/28
12:23:19 TO 2012/12/28
20:00:00]

Is it possible?

Thanks in advance
