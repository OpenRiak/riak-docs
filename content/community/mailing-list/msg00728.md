&gt; Hi, Wilson.
&gt;
&gt; There are many sets out there. Which ones suit you best depends a lot
&gt; on what you plan on saying in your talk. If you tell us a bit about
&gt; the audience, the event, and what you hope to get across in your talk,
&gt; then I bet that one of the people here who has given a Riak talk will
&gt; have material useful for you to crib from.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
