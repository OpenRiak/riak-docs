&gt; Howdy Riak Users,
&gt; 
&gt; Recently I discovered that my MapReduce job, that used to run
&gt; successfully, stopped working.
&gt; Here is the error:
&gt; {"phase":0,"error":"[timeout]","input":"{&lt;&lt;\\"test\\"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;\\"123\\"&gt;&gt;}","type":"forward\\_preflist","stack":"[]"}
&gt; 
&gt; Is anyone familiar with this problem? How can I make it to work?
&gt;
