I'm not here to define a perfect infrastructure for securing NoSQL
databases and Riak and go into implementation details... It's not my
intention because I simply don't have time to dedicate to this big
project and it's impossible to come up with a perfect solution right
away. Either way asking customers to be security experts is asking
for trouble... And I base this statement on the actual real world
experience in security, which I have quite a bit. I'll leave it on
this note :-) And let's talk in 10 or 15 years :-)


Let's skip the ad hominem. I'm gay. You are \\*not\\* going to win a
bitchiness contest.

I want to help people build robust, secure systems. What little you've
proposed is not only useless but dangerous. I can't risk someone
implementing it.

I'm volunteering my time to answer questions on building secure
applications in general: with Riak, with MySQL, with HTTP, with Active
Directory, whatever. Not an expert on everything, but I can provide
pointers to more comprehensive sources. Feel free to contact me off-list
if it doesn't pertain to Riak.

I'll also try to write an introductory blog post on application security
this weekend. If you'd like to contribute, or just want to see some
topic covered, let me know.
