Yes, Andrew -- that is a fine approach to using a connection pool.

Go for it.

&gt; I just want to make sure I'm totally clear on this.  Bob's solution
&gt; would work well with my design.  So basically, this would be the
&gt; workflow?
&gt;
&gt; 1.  check out connection from the pool
&gt; 2.  set client id on connection (which would have some static and some
&gt; random component)
&gt; 3.  perform multiple operations (gets, puts, etc.) which would be seen
&gt; as a single "transaction"
&gt; 4.  check in the connection to the pool
&gt;
&gt; This way once the connection is checked out from the pool, if another
&gt; user comes along he cannot get that same connection until it has been
&gt; checked back in, which would meet Justin's requirements.  However,
&gt; each time it's checked out, a new client id is created.
&gt;
&gt; Does this sound reasonable and in line with proper client id usage?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again!

&gt;&gt; The simplest guidance on client IDs that I can give:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If two mutation (PUT) operations could occur concurrently or without
&gt;&gt; awareness of each other, then they should have different client IDs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As a result of the above: if you are sharing a connection, then you
&gt;&gt; should use a different client ID for each separate user of that
&gt;&gt; connection.
