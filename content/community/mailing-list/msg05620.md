&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I have Riak servers A, B and C. 
&gt; As I know, assume I put my data into Riak server A via HTTP interface, 
&gt; I will hashed and determined to be stored in some other servers. May be 
&gt; finally stored into B and C.
&gt; 
&gt; What I want is listen to the upload event.
&gt; And one and only one of them A, B, C kick off some external process.
&gt; 
&gt; Any API for that ?
&gt; Or I should have watching processes in all A, B, C servers (will have race 
&gt; condition and locking problem)?
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, I am new to Riak. I may miss some important components. 
&gt; Please point that out to me. 

I think that pre/post commit hooks would satisfy this requirement. Have a look 
at the wiki page for more details http://wiki.basho.com/Commit-Hooks.html
