&gt;&gt;&gt; Awesome. Grats on the release and all the hard work that went into it. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. I heard differing things when I asked in other forums but I wanted to 
&gt;&gt;&gt; get an answer here, does Riak CS support range requests? Aka give me bytes 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 100-200 from this 3MB file. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As Reid Draper said on HN, yes it does support range queries.
&gt; 
&gt; I got a DM from someone else at Basho that said otherwise.
Sorry for the confusion. The first version of the "developer release" of Riak 
CS does not support range requests, but it will shortly after.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Pricing. Is Riak CS priced like S3 in terms of storage volume, bandwidth 
&gt;&gt;&gt; and lookups?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Pricing is per-node. I believe you can cram as many CPUs, drives and RAM
&gt;&gt; info a node as you want and pay the same flat per-node price.
&gt; 
&gt; That's awesome. My own private S3 or someone else will host one for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
