Can you provide your map/reduce queries in a pastie or gist?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; when I'm expecting this result.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; [{"apps":["11","12"]},{"apps":["1","2","3","4‚Äù]}]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; can anyone tell me why the map/reduce phases wrapped my json objects with
&gt; "" and added all the backslashes?
&gt;
&gt; when I read these values straight forward I get them as objects and not
&gt; wrapped and escaped.
