Actually this is what I'm doing…

A as an unique ID, lets call it A-UID

A and B are stored in the bucket with keys A-UID and B-UID

The link in B for A will be named A-UID
And link in A for B will be named B-UID

Thanks,

Morgan.

&gt; It's not that links are that slow, but that they're not that focused.
&gt; Unless you're using B's key as the tag on the link from A, and A's key
&gt; as the tag on the link from B, you'll have to follow all "person" or
&gt; "friend" (or whatever) links from A, and the same from B. So, what
&gt; you'd actually be walking is A -&gt; [any person/friend] -&gt; A. You could
&gt; put a map or reduce phase between the two link phases to filter out
&gt; everything but B, but my bet is that simply fetching A and B
&gt; individually will be much faster than setting up and tearing down the
&gt; MR framework.
&gt; 
&gt; YMMV, always benchmark real data, etc.
