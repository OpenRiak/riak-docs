&gt; I pushed to my Github a Lager backend for sending log messages to RabbitMQ

&gt; It uses a re-connecting connection pool for sending messages, so it's pretty 
&gt; fast and will automatically recover if RabbitMQ goes down (but it does \\*not\\*, 
&gt; at the moment, internally queue log messages if it can't connect to the 
&gt; broker). 
&gt; 
&gt; The idea is to aggregate logging from riak\\_core applications, but you should 
&gt; be able to use it in Riak/DB as well.

Many thanks, it looks good. I've added a link to it from lager's README.
