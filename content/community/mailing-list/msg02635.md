&gt;&gt; It is not currently, but we are looking into the feasibility of supporting 
&gt;&gt; other languages. However, I might say that if you're already doing Python 
&gt;&gt; and PHP, it would be worth your while (and not difficult) to learn 
&gt;&gt; JavaScript.
&gt; 
&gt; We already have a whole bunch of processing on the data written in Python and 
&gt; PHP, and porting them to Javascript is (1) very tedious, and (2) Javascript 
&gt; does not support the required functionality. For example, we do a bunch of 
&gt; NLP analysis on the data.
&gt; 
&gt; Given these, is it advisable if I expose these processes as webservices and 
&gt; call them from javascript/erlang?
&gt; 

The other option of course, is to pre-process your data and just insert 
multiple copies in different formats, which is a pretty common pattern. The 
tradeoff is whether you want to pay the cost at query time or at write time. 
If you can pay that cost up-front, reads will likely be key-value or very 
simple MapReduce and thus very fast.
