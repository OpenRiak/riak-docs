Morning, Afternoon, Evening to all,

A short recap to take you into the weekend: A new Java Protocol
Buffers Client, some questions from #riak, and conversation about
throughput and latency.

Enjoy your weekend.

Riak Recap for 6/24

1) @drkrab released his initial version of a Java Protocol Buffers
Client for Riak. Thanks for putting some time against this, Kresten!

Blog post here ---&gt;
http://www.javalimit.com/2010/06/java---riak-protocol-buffers-api.html

Github repo here ---&gt; http://github.com/krestenkrab/riak-java-pb-client

Added to the Riak Wiki here ---&gt;
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Community-Developed+Libraries+and+Projects

1a) On a general note, the Protocol Buffers activity out of the
community has been awesome! Ruby and Java are now available and being
worked on, with (hopefully) Clojure and C libs on the horizon. Truly
great stuff!

2) Q --- I was wondering about Riak. Really interested in it. Does it
have a credible backer, I can't choose something that might be gone in
a few years time. (from omarkj via #riak)

 A (pt.1) --- It won't be gone. It's opensource code. Even if for
some reason, Basho doesn't support it any more, anyone can keep
improving it. (from Jedi\\_SCT1)

 A (pt.2) --- Basho Technologies is the commercial backer of Riak.
http://basho.com/ and http://basho.com/contact.html might be of some
use if you're looking for more information. Also, all of us here at
Basho -- http://twitter.com/basho/team/members -- have no intention of
ever seeing Riak disappear :)

3) Q --- Do you know if it's being widely used? ( from omarkj via #riak)

 A --- http://www.basho.com/customers.html is a small portion of
our commercial users. There are also numerous installations of open
source Riak (that we know about), one example of which would be
Widescript, (http://widescript.com/) a web-based collaborative
e-reading platform.

4) benblack and gotascii had a conversation in #riak about throughput,
latency, and scaling. Definitely a worthwhile read.
