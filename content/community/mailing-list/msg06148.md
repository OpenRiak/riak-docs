Dear all,



I am using Cent Os and am very confused about installing erlang and
program in it. When I established riak cluster and tried to run map
reduce as instructed I am getting the following error.



"/usr/bin/env: escript: No such file or directory"

I downloaded the tar file R14B03 and un tar it.

Any insights are well appreciated



Regards

Sai Sagar. J
