You shouldn't have to if the hostname of the computer is the same - either via 
DNS or /etc/hosts. The key is whether the name of your node actually is 
actually r...@storage-1. This should be set in vm.args already if the names 
are actually applied as you say. To double check, attach to the running node 
with `riak-admin attach` (or start it with `riak console`) and see what it says 
at the prompt.

&gt; hey guys, 
&gt; 
&gt; so, i've got my riak nodes looking something like this
&gt; 
&gt; r...@storage-1
&gt; r...@storage-2
&gt; 
&gt; with storage-1, storage-2 being the hostnames of each computer in the 
&gt; cluster. now, if i were to reassign the ip address to storage-1 would i still 
&gt; need to "riak-admin reip " the data on that machine?
