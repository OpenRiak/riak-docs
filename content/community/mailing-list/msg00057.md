Riak Recap for 4/15/2010


1) Anyone got a clean and simple way of adding JSONP support to
Riak/Webmachine without adding an intermediate layer (such as a java
servlet, a Rails thingy, etc)? (from chids via IRC)

A ---- Unfortunately, it doesn't look like their is a "clean and
simple" way to do this. Your best bet is to either hack the HTTP
interface itself or do some sort of proxying. ( It's also probably
worth saying that it's not generally a good idea to allow cross-domain
requests right to a database of any kind.)

2) I'm trying to get two riak nodes to talk to each other on aws.. is
there a particular port i should have open in my security group?
if i open all ports i can make a connection, but otherwise get a "Node
riak@(blah) is not reachable!" (from keej via IRC)

A ---- Firstly, make sure that the two nodes you are trying to connect
are in the same security group. For port info, check out this mailing
list question from a few months ago:

3) Marten Gustafson (aka @martengustafson aka chids) gave a NoSQL
overview presentation yesterday highlighting Riak (and some other
database called "Couch"?). Check it out if you get the chance:

4) Basho's own Bryan Fink (@hobbyist) will be taking the stage at
NoSQL(EU) this coming week (assuming that Iceland cooperates, of
course).
