Hi, Andrey.

You are of course free to dislike anything you wish, but it is worth mentioning 
that GPL and LGPL are very different licenses; the LGPL is missing infectious 
aspects of the GPL.

There are many projects which could not use GPL code compatibly with their 
preferred license but which can safely use LGPL code.
