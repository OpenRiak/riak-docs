Hi Riak Team,

I am a bit confused over etags and vector-clocks usage.

If I can do conditional gets and puts using etags, why do I need
Vector clocks or to ask it another way around if I am doing
conditional gets and puts using etags then should I still be sending
in the vector clock?

What is the overlap in functionality and when is one better than the other?

Cheers
Piyush
