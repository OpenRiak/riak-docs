Hello folk,
I am trying to Install riak on my system , Ubuntu 10.10, 64 bit.

I downloaded "riak-0.14.0-1.tar.gz"
unzip it and cd INTO riak-0.14.0

Now I am running the command : sudo make rel

And I am getting the Error message : "fatal: Not a git repository (or
any of the parent directories): .git"

Please help me, I tried googling but could'nt resolve my problem.
