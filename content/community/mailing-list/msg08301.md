Hi Kresten, thank you for your reminding. 
One bucket, "messages", is used to classify the message.A message is rather 
small and is appended to the list one by one. 
The messages/\\_beta is used to store the first key and last key of messages, and 
its value is something like: {"first": "1", "last": "3000"}, and it will be 
changed and written on each message.
Performance is a less important for now.
