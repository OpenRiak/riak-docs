David,

If you're running 1.2, you'll have to do 'riak-admin cluster plan'
followed by 'riak-admin cluster commit' on the command line. I don't
think Riak Control has been updated to accommodate the new 1.2 cluster
membership changes.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I am using riak control now. I just booted up 5 nodes with no data. I use 
&gt; chef to boot up the cluster and when booted I ssh into the machine and run 
&gt; riak-admin cluster join riak@111.111.111.111 where 111.111.111.111 is a 
&gt; randomly chosen ip address in the group.
&gt;
&gt; I go to riak control and this is what I get.
&gt;
&gt; 1) I see two green lights
&gt; 2) On of the green lights has 100% of the partitions
&gt; 3) The other three have a status of joining.
&gt;
&gt; I waited and waited, and tried riak control on other machines. Same story.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; How do I resolve?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
