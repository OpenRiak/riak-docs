I have a bucket containing about 1,000 records. These records are
indexed on a property let's call "flavor". There are only about 10
different flavors.

Is there a way I could query the flavor\\_bin index to discover what these
unique values are? The brute-force method would be a map-reduce doing a
range query on 'flavor\\_bin' from 'AAAA' to 'zzzz' and then boiling that
down to the unique values in the reduce phase. But that would have to
retrieve every record in the bucket.

Is there some meta-data about the index I could query more efficiently
to do this?

This is not something I would need to do very often, and I would store
the resulting list in one record for actual use by the application.
