Hi there, Sean! These sound great (especially #2, for our specific needs).

&gt;
&gt; Hey riak-users,
&gt;
&gt; I've begun adding Riak 1.2-related features to the Python client. As I am
&gt; doing so, I am reminded about how much technical debt exists in the client,
&gt; as discussed at length previously on Github and this mailing list. Because
&gt; I know some of you are using the client in production or as a component of
&gt; another library, I'd like to assess what risks there are in removing or
&gt; changing certain features. Here's my plan:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Remove all the set\\_r/get\\_r-style methods for quorums. Instead,
&gt; RiakBucket will have custom object-properties for these that let you set
&gt; the corresponding quorums in the bucket-properties, but will not be the
&gt; sort of cascading-preference behavior that it is currently. If you want
&gt; to
&gt; change a quorum when fetching, storing, or deleting a key, you can pass
&gt; it
&gt; with keyword arguments to the appropriate method.
&gt; 2. Remove the edge-case-ridden ConnectionManager for a pair of resource
&gt; pools for each protocol, like what is available in the Ruby client.
&gt; Access
&gt; to a connection would be granted via a 'with' statement, naturally, and
&gt; the
&gt; protocol selected would be based on the stated preference of the user,
&gt; or
&gt; on whether the transport supports the given feature. For example, stats
&gt; would always use HTTP. We could also take this opportunity to add
&gt; error-sensitive host selection and automatic retries to the client.
&gt; 3. Merge the RiakSearch class into the RiakClient class and push some of
&gt; its functionality down into the connection classes.
&gt;
&gt; I intend to make the Python client ready for the 1.2 release without these
&gt; refactorings, but I would greatly appreciate your feedback before starting
&gt; the above items.
