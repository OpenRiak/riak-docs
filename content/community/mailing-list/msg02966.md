Hi,

By "not doing anything" I meant they were idling apart from the riak/Erlang 
processes running.

And yes, riak-admin status shows all five nodes according in ring\\_members 
according to [1].

Thanks,

Can you explain what you mean by "Four of the nodes were not doing anything 
else"?

Does "riak-admin status" show the appropriate nodes in the ring?

Thanks,
Dan

Hi,

I have set up a 5-node test environment to give Riak a test run. I wrote a 
Python script (http://pastebin.com/geQ00Ngb) that 
put 53780 key-values into my cluster. Using round robin, 11 threads inserted 
these values in ~70 seconds. This means an average of ~750 key-values/second. 
Is this the expected speed of inserts? It seems quite slow. The Mozilla 
benchmark 
(http://blog.mozilla.com/data/2010/08/16/benchmarking-riak-for-the-mozilla-test-pilot-project/)
 reached &gt; 1500 ops/second for significantly bigger values than my benchmark.

Additional information:
\\* Four of the nodes were not doing anything else.
\\* n\\_val=3
\\* For every insert, w=1 and dw=0.
\\* All nodes are using riak\\_0.14.1-1\\_amd64.deb and I have not changed any of the 
defaults settings except Erlang -cookie and -name.

Thanks,
Jens Rantil
