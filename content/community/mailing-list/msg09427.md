The documentation (briefly) mentions a preference of XFS over EXT
filesystems. I haven't seen any further explanation as of why that is.
Is there any significant difference?

I've managed to notice a significant difference between EXT3 and EXT4
- one of the machines in the benchmark cluster I was running had ext3
by accident and showed a greater load-average during the benchmark.

Does anyone have any tips or experiences?
