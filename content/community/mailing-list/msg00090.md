BERT is used by GIthub as RPC for Ruby/Erlang integration and the purpose is
documented here github.com/blog/531-introducing-bert-and-bert-rpc and
bert-rpc.org/
It is mainly created to avoid some of the shortcomings in Protocol Buffer
and Thrift. BERT has good support for multipe languages like PB/Thrift. I
definetly hope that for Riak, you guys would have studied deeply before
venture into PB. Do you have any writeups for choosing PB over BERT?

This question arises when I want to talk to Riak from another elrnag app.I
am using raik\\_client and its dependant module for talking to Riak from
another Erlang application (it is not co-located), is that the right way to
do (I listed modules needed for native erlang RPC here
pmsenthilkumar.blogspot.com/2010/04/riak-thoughts-on-erlang-based-client.html)?
or should I use riak-erlang-client? It is kind of not clear by looking at
various blogs and wikis or doucments included as part of Riak under folder
doc. Sorry for trying to connect 2 different questions in this mailing list.
