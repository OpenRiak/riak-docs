Mike,

Riak (to be specific, riak-kv) it built atop riak-core. The Basho devs
recognized that a lot of the things that made riak-kv great were more
general than just key-value storage. This includes things like consistent
hashing, virtual nodes, hinted handoff, etc. They built riak-core as a
foundation to build Dynamo based apps. You could use riak-core to build a
distributed computing cluster (i.e. no data, just for distributing work).
 One example, a pretty original one I might add too, is Rusty's BashoBanjo
which uses riak-core to power a "distributed orchestra." [1]

I think riak-core has a lot of potential beyond it's current usage and I'm
working on a small but not completely trivial example that I hope to
illustrate with a blog post. Specifically, I want to focus on the mechanics
of the "vnode" as this, AFAICT, is the main player when you want to leverage
riak-core. Consider this a teaser to make sure I follow thru on my word :)

&gt; When would you use riak\\_core that you wouldn't use Riak? Is it more
&gt; ephemeral, with shared state
&gt; in an ETS ring compared to a storage-backed node?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks...
