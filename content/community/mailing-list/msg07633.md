Hi Mark,
Riak admin reports 6 (out of 15 nodes) with 25-30% free memory, 3 nodes with 
8-10% and 6 nodes with 18-20%. 
This unequal distribution forces us to add new nodes relatively fast.

Cheers

&gt; Hi,

&gt; We have Riak cluster running 1.1.2. All the nodes own 6.6% of partitions, 
&gt; still memory usage of "beam" process on some nodes is less than the others 
&gt; (significantly). The number of keys on the nodes consuming less memory is 
&gt; also fewer. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Can you add some more color to "significantly"? That would help us diagnose 
&gt; things.
