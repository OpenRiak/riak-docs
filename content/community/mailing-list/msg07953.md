Hi Erik!

Thanks for the suggestions. I checked out /tmp but didn't see anything
that looked like a pipe for riak... perhaps could you tell me what the file
would be named?

Not sure which logs would be most useful, but please find everything that
was generated attached.

&gt; This happens if Riak has previously been run by a different user.
&gt; If it's not that, I suggest you provide the logs from the failed "riak
&gt; start" attempt for further diagnosis...
