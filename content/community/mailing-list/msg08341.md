You do need to do a rolling upgrade, but 1.0 -&gt; 1.2 is fine.

&gt; Hey Sohil,

&gt; maybe my writeup of a 0.14.2 to 1.2 migration helps
&gt; http://tisba.de/2012/08/20/migrating-riak-from-0-14-2-to-1-2/
&gt;
&gt; AFAIK the recommended upgrade path ist pre-1.0 to 1.1.4 to 1.2.

&gt; Hi ,
&gt;
&gt; I have upgrade riak 0.14.2 to 1.0 and now i want to upgrade it to 1.2 .
&gt; I have few questions .
&gt; 1&gt; Is it possible to upgrade directly from 1.0 to 1.2 or do i need to follow
&gt; intermediate upgrading steps like 1.0 -&gt; 1.1 -&gt; 1.2 ?
&gt; 2&gt; Do i need to follow same steps which are mention at
&gt; https://wiki.basho.com/Rolling-Upgrades.html While upgrading from 1.0+ to
&gt; 1.2 ?
&gt;
&gt; thanks ,
&gt; Sohil
