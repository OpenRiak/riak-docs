I've begun adding Protobuf support to the PHP Client on a branch of my fork
but it's a ways off

&gt; &gt; With Riak, my main challenge is getting this data loaded. Using the
&gt; &gt; PHP library I am able to push 100-200 documents/sec.
&gt;
&gt; A quick grep through the PHP client source suggests that that client
&gt; doesn't support the Protocol Buffers interface to Riak. Depending on
&gt; the workload, a PB-based client is anywhere from 20% to several hundred
&gt; percent faster than an HTTP-based client.
&gt;
&gt; You'll definitely want to run multiple clients in parallel, especially
&gt; if/when your cluster is larger than a single box: pointing those clients
&gt; at different cluster members will get you different throughput than
&gt; pointing all clients at a single cluster member.
&gt;
&gt; Your message hadn't included any messages from the Riak server logs that
&gt; might give hints to why the HTTP service becomes unavailable ... but
&gt; it's likely that there's useful info there.
