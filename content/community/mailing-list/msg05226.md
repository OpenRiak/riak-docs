Hi all,

I'm using the python bindings for Riak so there may be an element of this
being obscured due to the library.

I'm creating a link between two objects - I can establish it, query it and
tag it so that part is working great. What I want to do now is determine the
date/time a link was created between the two objects. That way I could
generate a job that says get me all the objects of bucket A that are linked
to bucket B that were linked at time X (and potentially date ranging down
the line as well but walk then run).

Is this doable? Am I looking in the wrong place by looking at the data
available on the link itself?

Kind regards
Andrew
