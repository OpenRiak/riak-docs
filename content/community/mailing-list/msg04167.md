I'm setting up a brand-new staging server, with Riak 0.14.2.

As I want to get all production data, I thought I could scp the data
directory into the new one (besides the ring dir).

What I normally do in this case is 'riak-admin backup .. and
riak-admin restore from that file. works like a charm. and you can
selectively backup/restore a node, or a the whole cluster.


Assuming the nodes are well-connected, does this work better than adding 
a new node, letting data migrate there, then removing the old one?
