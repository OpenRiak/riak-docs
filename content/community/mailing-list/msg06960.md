&gt; You are correct, these messages are fine to ignore.

&gt; &gt; Hi
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We're using Riak 1.1.1 (on Ubuntu, built from source) and are seeing a
&gt; number of errors raised regularly in the error logs during mapreduce. I
&gt; think I remember reading a post on this forum a while ago that these error
&gt; messages are nothing to worry about, that they are just a result of one
&gt; aspect of the mapreduce processing shutting down before receiving a normal
&gt; shutdown message from another process - hence the {sink\\_died, normal}. The
&gt; comments in the source code where this error is generated seem to back this
&gt; up. Indeed, the mapreduce operations in question all completed just fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can someone from Basho please confirm that this is the case and that
&gt; we're safe to ignore them? Here are the entries in error.log:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2012-03-13 23:25:12.810 [error] &lt;0.10984.0&gt; gen\\_fsm &lt;0.10984.0&gt; in state
