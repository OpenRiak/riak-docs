&gt; Rebalancing can be quite expensive with the default claim algorithm

&gt; this week, I hope), we will be switching to a new default claim
&gt; algorithm that will dramatically decrease the amount of
&gt; rebalancing/shuffling that will be required. With this change in
&gt; place, we've seen production clusters grow from 11 to 30+ nodes with

David. Thanks for the update on the changes. They sounds great.

Yes, they should be rolling stats on a 1 minute interval. We've
&gt; observed normal behaviour in the production systems we've seen, but
&gt; I'll ask someone to double check that they are working correctly.
&gt; Thanks for reporting this.

That's what I thought. Very strange. Let me know if there any debug data
I can provide to assist.
