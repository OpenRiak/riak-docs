Hi, Mikhail.

&gt; Thank you for the description. Â I now wonder if it's possible for a

&gt; it to the next phase"?

It is quite possible in Riak to have a map phase followed by another
map phase. You simply have to declare the job as having those phases,
each with their map function.

The way you showed it wouldn't quite work, as it is the return value
-- not a side effect -- that a map function passes on to the following
phase.
