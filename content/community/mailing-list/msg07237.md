Better marketing of Mathias' excellent Riak Handbook would definitely
help...would be great if it showed up on Amazon at least if not
bn.com.

Someday replication making it into the community version would be
really nice...it's one of the few areas where Cassandra has a leg up.
Makes it easier to sell/stand up a resilient proof-of-concept across
availability zones and then buy support when the installation is grown
to support more production load.
