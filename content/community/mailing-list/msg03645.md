Riak Recap for June 8 - 9
===================

1) Though he has been hacking away on Riak full time for almost a
month now, we just got around to posting a blog about Joe Blomstedt
joining the team here at Basho.

2) Sean Cribbs added some details to the Vector Clocks page on the
Riak Wiki. The biggest additions pertain to last\\_write\\_wins and how it
affects vector clock resolution.

\\* Exact additions highlighted here in the commit ---&gt;
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_wiki/commit/d576e965d70eaa7427193126874a75dd468479e5

3) We added some details to the Riak Knowledge Base about running
Bitcask and Innostore in the same cluster.

4) For anyone heading to NodecampEU this weekend, Basho Developer
Advocate Mathias Meyer (@roidrage) will be in attendance and ready to
chat about Erlang, Riak and coffee. Most importantly, he'll be giving
a talk, so be sure to attend. (He'll notice if you don't.)

5) Dan Dean (@dandean) has a new project up on GitHub called
"riakjs-model" and, as the name indicates, is meant to provide a model
abstraction around riak-js. Looking forward to watching this one
develop...

6) One job to pass along:

\\* Ideeli in NYC is hiring Engineers with "Working knowledge of MySQL,
MongoDB or Riak" ---&gt;
