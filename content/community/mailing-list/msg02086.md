I wouldn't do a linked list using Riak links unless it was a small list.

With a bytes you can transverse to the node the has a key closest to the
left side of your range and then do a in order tranversal of the tree until
you reach the right side of your range.

It's a lot like a binary search tree but is better for high latency reads
like a disk or networked data store because each node in the tree has a
chunk of keys.
