Hello,
I'm new to riak and k/v db as well. I want to write a social data model
(users, friends, posts, comments and likes). I'm used to use relational db
and I think my aproach will be very biased for that previous knowledge.

This is a very common data model, so, I guess anybody has an example. Any
idea will be welcome.

My first approach:

\\* bucket: user
key: username ; Value: profile data

friends; links between users (user bucket)

\\* bucket: post
key: username; Value Post data (with comments and likes nested)


Thanks in advance.
