Hi, one of the riak nodes is not starting. I am getting 
{badmatch,already\\_exists} in sasl-error.log.

At first, I was getting 'eaccess' errors, so I changed all of the files to be 
owned by "root:root". Now, I am getting,
{badmatch,already\\_exists}.

In, erlang.log.1, I see:
[{application,riak\\_kv},{exited,{shutdown,{riak\\_kv\\_app,start,[normal,[]]}}},{type,permanent}]/home/me/dev/poc/riak/riak/rel/riak/lib/os\\_mon-2.2.5/priv/bin/memsup:
 Erlang has closed.
Erlang has closed
{"Kernel pid 
terminated",application\\_controller,"{application\\_start\\_failure,riak\\_kv,{shutdown,{riak\\_kv\\_app,start,[normal,[]]}}}"}

Crash dump was written to: erl\\_crash.dump
Kernel pid terminated (application\\_controller) 
({application\\_start\\_failure,riak\\_kv,{shutdown,{riak\\_kv\\_app,start,[normal,[]]}}})

In my etc/vm.args, -name riak@10.0.60.208 (which is a 
unique name).

Any ideas on why I cannot start riak?

David
