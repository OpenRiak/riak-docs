Has anyone had success running a large Riak cluster on a VPS? I'm considering 
using this service since the price point is right, but I am wondering about the 
viability.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

on March 2nd.

5) This isn't specific to Riak but very applicable and interesting
nonetheless: a group at Berkeley is working on testing just how
"eventual" eventual consistency actually is in Dynamo-style systems.
You might be surprised...
