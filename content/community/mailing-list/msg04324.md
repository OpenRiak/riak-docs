Riak Recap for August 8 - 9
=====================

1) A video of Justin Sheehy's "Thing Break, Riak Bends" presentation
from QCon London is online. It runs just under an hour with questions,
but it's well worth it.

\\* Grab a beverage and watch here ---&gt;

2) Brian Rowe wrote a short post about changing Erlang's default
logging behavior that might be of interest to some of you.

3) I stumbled onto a new repo from Dan Dean (@dandean) yesterday
called "Tubbs." This looks to be a general ORM for working with data
with support for Riak.

\\* Code here ---&gt; https://github.com/dandean/tubbs

4) I wrote a blog post about the Ripple Hackathon that happened at
BashoWest in July.

Experience. Details here ---&gt; http://bit.ly/pgkUlc
