I have a search that boils down to this...

search-cmd search zids "facebook\\_credential\\_keys:591006980"

We have five servers behind a load balancer and at least one of them seems to 
fail that search. I am storing Oauth credentials in Riak for each user; at 
least one server fails and the failure leads to a crash in our single-sign-on 
server.

&gt; Hi Martin,
&gt; 
&gt; Can you clarify what you mean by "bad results"? I don't believe Ripple has 
&gt; exactly what you are looking for, as most of the operations it's going to 
&gt; perform are using the pure ruby riak client for performing get/put operations.
