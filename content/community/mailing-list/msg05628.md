&gt; Hi, guys.

&gt; I've recently noticed that newest rebar requires .app.src files to
&gt; list the modules to be compiled, unless {validate\\_app\\_modules, false}
&gt; property is set in rebar.config:
&gt; https://github.com/basho/rebar/blob/master/src/rebar\\_otp\\_app.erl#L57
&gt;

I fear you may be missing something -- I've verified this with rebar
HEAD on a number of repos just now and the behaviour is fine. Perhaps
you have an old rebar on your path?
