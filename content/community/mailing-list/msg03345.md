Matt,

We've looked at upgrading to JaegerMonkey, but haven't yet gotten a build that 
works properly on Solaris (and SPARC), which some of our customers require. I 
personally have not followed its development and so I don't know if there's a 
profile that works on SPARC yet.

Although upgrading to Jaeger would be a big help, I'm more concerned about the 
bottleneck of converting everything to JSON before it is sent into JS -- which 
also presents problems when you have binary data that is not coercible into 
UTF-8. There is at least one bug where the JSON-encoding issue is discussed, 
but we recently marked it dormant because of the lack of simple solutions:
