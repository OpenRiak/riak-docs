hello all,

http://IP:8098/riak?buckets=true [ will show all
available buckets on Riak
]
http://IP:8098/riak/bucketname?keys=true&props=false [ will show all
available keys on a bucket ]

to me, this proves a very big security
risk, as if somebody discovers your Riak server's IP, is very easy to
read all the information from it, even if you try to obfuscate the
buckets/keys... everything is highly readable.
there is any way to
disable those options? like {riak\\_kv\\_stat, false} hides the /stats
page

thanks

Rohman
