Hi Neville,

Riak Search uses the JVM to run analyzers. Analyzers are configured using
the analyzer\\_factory option in the schema (set schema wide or per field).
Analyzers determine how incoming data is broken down and indexed, for
example a white space analyzer would break a document into words by
splitting on white space characters and indexing the words.

Regarding the schema, this section of the wiki should answer your question:

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Great work to release Riak 0.13 and Riak Search.
&gt;
&gt; I'm curious to understand how much of Riak Search is pure Erlang, and when
&gt; does Riak Search use the JVM?
&gt;
&gt; Also are the Riak Search Indexes and config/schema files all stored in
&gt; Bitcask, or does Riak Search use the local node file system for storage at
&gt; all?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks and congratulations
