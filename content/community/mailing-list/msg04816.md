 A few questions 

1) Is this fix in the RC1 build that just came out today?
2) How exactly do search-cmd install, the "search" bucket property and the 
precommit hook fit together now? I'm a bit unclear on what I actually need to 
do to enable search on a bucket.

Thanks.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Jon,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for getting back to me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm doing full-text indexing, but I don't need to keep the text around 
&gt; &gt; &gt; once my object has been indexed, so I wrote a second precommit hook to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; remove the text from the object. This reduces the size of my objects 
&gt; &gt; &gt; drastically (since text tends to be the largest part) and has given us 
&gt; &gt; &gt; substantial perf gains in our tests.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I just pushed a fix for this. It should be present in the next 1.0
&gt; &gt; prerelease.
