That's good to know; thanks. I imagine I may have to vary my physical node 
count as time goes by, and I wondering how much planning ahead that might take.

Going by your example, if my n\\_val is 4 and an object hashes to partition 6, 
then my object will be stored only on two physical nodes, right? In my system 
(as in many), some objects are much more important than others, although I 
unfortunately don't know which are which until after the fact. Having two 
server failures in rapid succession is not all that uncommon, so I might have 
to use an n\\_val of 5 to guarantee storage on 3 physical nodes, right?

Cheers,
John
