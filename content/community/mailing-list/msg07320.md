Greetings Riak Java people!

We've recently completed a couple pages for the Riak Java Cookbook that I 
wanted to share:

Fetching Data from Riak:
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/wiki/Fetching-Data-from-Riak

Storing Data in Riak:
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/wiki/Storing-data-in-riak

By providing these we hope to make understanding and using the Java client as 
easy and painless as possible!

Thanks!
Brian Roach
