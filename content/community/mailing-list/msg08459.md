Hi, Shahar. The Javascript functions included with Riak are defined in
a file named "mapred\\_builtins.js":
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/blob/master/priv/mapred\\_builtins.js

The functions in json2.js from the erlang\\_js project are also
included: https://github.com/basho/erlang\\_js/blob/master/priv/json2.js
