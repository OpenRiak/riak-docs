Last week StackMob open-sourced the Riak client library we use in our Scala
applications, Scaliak (https://github.com/stackmob/scaliak). 0.1.1-SNAPSHOT
is now published to Sonatype's OSSRH (oss.sonatype.org). Only a 2.9.1
artifact is available at this time but we will providing ones for newer
versions of Scala soon (there are some blockers in releasing a 2.10
version, currently but 2.9.1-1/2.9.2 should be pretty straightforward). We
most likely will not provide artifacts for pre-2.9 versions of Scala unless
there are requests for it.

If you are using SBT:

scalaVersion := "2.9.1"
libraryDependencies += "com.stackmob" %% "scaliak" % "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT"

If you are using maven:


com.stackmob
scaliak\\_2.9.1
0.1.1-SNAPSHOT


We'd love to hear any feedback people have on the library and contributions
are always welcome. We have been using Riak with the features implemented
in Scaliak in production for a little while now and will continue to
develop the library based on our priorities as well as those of the
community.

Cheers,

Jordan
