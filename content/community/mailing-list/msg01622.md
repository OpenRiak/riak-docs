&gt;&gt; 1. Take down one node at a time and innodump the data so I have a
&gt;&gt; known good backup
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If you're taking each node down, why not simply backup the filesystem
&gt; instead of using innodump? Restoring the filesystem should work just as
&gt; well, right? That way you'd have a backend agnostic procedure that would
&gt; also be faster and you'd always backup the ring state (less steps).

fileystem level backup will be fine for disaster recovery if shit hit
the fan but if a straightforward upgrade does not work, data
extraction and restore in the new upgraded cluster will be required.

thanks all for your input, I will be testing a 0.10 to 0.13 (with
innostore) upgrade soon and let you guys know how that worked out.
