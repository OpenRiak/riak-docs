1) If I have a user model, how do I list the users w/o doing an
expensive find all? It seems like I'd want to have a single object
that links to all of the users, but that doesn't fit with the
conventions in ripple right?

2) I just watched the webinar and looked at the docs - do I still want
yajl-ruby? The webinar says I do but I didn't see it mentioned in the
docs.
