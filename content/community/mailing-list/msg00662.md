Hi David,

This is a known issue that occurs in certain cases when you delete Riak
objects while performing a backup. This is scheduled to be fixed in the next
release (https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=278).

In the meantime, there is no real workaround except to try the backup again.

Best,
Rusty

&gt; It seems to create a backup file so I suspect the error doesn't have
&gt; anything to do with file permissions. I assume it isn't valid based on
&gt; the error though. Any ideas?
