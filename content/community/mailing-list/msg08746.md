Bitcask keeps a keymap in ram. That is why it is limited to a certain number of 
keys in practice. LevelDB does not have these restrictions. Use LevelDB and 
your main limitation will be disk.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; we are currently evaluating using riak as storage backend for our users 
&gt; messages (currently running on MySQL).
&gt; 
&gt; This will result to about 4.2 billion k/v with an estimated key-length of 
&gt; about 25-30 bytes and about average 400 bytes of data (the messages are 
&gt; usually very short). The amount of data will raise about 8 million k/v per 
&gt; day. Most data will only be read a few times and never again afterwards.
&gt; 
&gt; I entered this into the bitcask calculator, which resulted in a quite high 
&gt; number of suggested nodes just because of the memory requirement for storing 
&gt; all the keys. Is this really necessary if only very little of this data is 
&gt; really "active"?
&gt; 
&gt; Or should I use Level-DB instead? How do I estimate the amount of nodes with 
&gt; Level-DB?
