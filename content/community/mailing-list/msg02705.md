Ya, my original message just highlighted the standard 0,1,5 that most 
people/hardware should know/be able to support. There are better 
options and 10 would be one of them.

Depending on the number of disks available I might even argue 
running software RAID 10 for better throughput and less chance of 
data loss (as long as you can afford to cut your avail storage in 
half on every machine). It's not too hard to setup on modern Linux 
distros (mdadm); at least I was doing it 5 years ago and I'm no sys 
admin.
