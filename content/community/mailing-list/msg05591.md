So if I use a leveldb backend, and restrict the # of objects per bucket to 
dozens, and use the default bucket properties, I should be ok listing keys on 
the user buckets.
I guess the only open question here is Alexander's point about fd per leveldb 
bucket which rules out (or at least stretches) the 200M bucket option.

Thanks for your replies btw,
Izhar.

Refresh my memory, does leveldb open new files for each bucket? I'm thinking 
there may be some file descriptor penalty for this many buckets.

Otherwise you could set your default bucket properties to what you would want 
for these user buckets and then change properties if need be for a handful of 
other buckets you may need in your application.

- Will list-keys on such a user bucket be a reasonable action?

When using leveldb as the backend, list-keys is isolated to a bucket. As far as 
I can see, list\\_keys is a "blocking operation" meaning that a vnode doing 
list\\_keys can not respond to other requests while it is processing. So; in this 
case ... using leveldb and ~dozens of keys per bucket it does sound reasonable.

- Is list-keys isolated to a bucket?
- Is it reasonable to expect Riak to hold 200M buckets?

I'd say that it depends on your need to configure bucket properties.

Riak stores bucket properties in "the ring", which is a riak cluster's 
distributed state management.

The ring is not designed to have 200M entries as far as I know; and if you need 
to set bucket properties then the ring needs to hold those values (if you use 
the default properties it requires no state).

So, ... the answer is probably no in this case; 200M buckets is not reasonable, 
because you will likely eventually want to define properties for these buckets.

Kind regards,
