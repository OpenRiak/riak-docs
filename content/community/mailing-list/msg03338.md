So just backing up the files from separate nodes works? There won't be
inconsistencies in the data say if all the nodes had to be restored?

&gt; Assuming that the cluster is using the default storage engine

&gt; appends to files, and never re-opens a file for writing after it is
&gt; closed. This means that your favorite existing server filesystem
&gt; backup mechanism will Just Work.
&gt;
&gt; Other means exist, but that is the simplest and often the best.
