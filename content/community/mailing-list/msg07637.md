I apologize for asking this question if it's an FAQ or is documented somewhere, 
but I don't see anything specific mentioned about the size of integer indexes 
in 2i:

http://wiki.basho.com/Secondary-Indexes.html

I certainly could dive into to source code to answer this question, but in case 
someone here knows, what's the size of an integer index in 2i? I'm hoping that 
the answer will be that it's 64 bitsâ€¦

Thanks,

Berend
