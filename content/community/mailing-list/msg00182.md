Usually I'm all for records because of pattern matching and
compile-time checking. IMHO, broken upgrades are reason enough not to
use them directly for storage. I have yet to design a system where the
data structures never changed after the initial release. I hate to say
it but, for me, the answer may be to have functions which map between
records and orddicts/proplists. I guess this really isn't a
riak-specific issue, but its interesting to hear with other people
think about it.

&gt;&gt; Yes, the primary weakness of records would be upgrading them.  You could do 
&gt;&gt; it with a map-reduce job, but it would be better in general to use a more 
&gt;&gt; fluid data structure.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; In the defense of records :
&gt; Records can be pattern matched whereas dicts and proplists can't.
&gt; Using a record with dict attributes and single attributes for pattern 
&gt; matching ("state" attribute, or "type" ...) could be interesting.
