&gt; 
&gt; I am considering how best to design a system that processes data from
&gt; telescopes. A typical "step" in the processing might involve combining a
&gt; small number of calibration images with a (possibly large) set of observation
&gt; images in some way and then adding the result. To do this in a distributed
&gt; manner you would have the observations on various machines, broadcast the
&gt; calibrations, then do a map (the per-observation processing) followed by a
&gt; reduce (the summing).
&gt; 
&gt; So, in very vague terms, this fits roughly into map-reduce territory. What I
&gt; am doing now is seeing how the details work out with various "nosql" systems.
&gt; 
&gt; So my basic question is: how would the above fit with Riak? Alternatively,
&gt; what else should I consider?

Riak isn't good for computationally-expensive, long-running processing. You 
generally want to avoid M-R queries that take more than a couple seconds. I 
think your image processing job is better handled by something like Hadoop.

I think of Riak as a standard K-V store with the ability to customize query 
results with additional Erlang processing. It's almost like M-R is a misnomer 
for this feature.
