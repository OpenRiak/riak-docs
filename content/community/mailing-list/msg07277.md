&gt; OK, so how about Statebox? We use timestamps to ameliorate the GC problem so

&gt; Wrong. One of your hosts is not running NTP. Clock desync issues are fucking
&gt; \\*ubiquitous\\*, sadly, and you have to be willing to accept, say, losing all
&gt; conflicting writes from a client under some clock skew circumstances.

How hard is it for a cluster-aware application to tell that the clocks
are out of sync? You probably can't do better than NTP at fixing it,
but why even continue to run in that state? If all it takes is a
good clock for reliability, let's build good clocks.
