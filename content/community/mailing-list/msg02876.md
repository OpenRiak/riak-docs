&gt; Hey Jon,
&gt;
&gt; A webcast (or better yet a series of webcasts) on riak\\_core is a great
&gt; idea, and something we've been talking about producing. Guess we'll
&gt; just have to move a bit faster :) The first one will probably be an
&gt; overview of how to build a simple app with riak\\_core.
&gt;
&gt; Time permitting, we'll try and get some more content out there around
&gt; core. What else would you like to see?

&gt; &gt; Pouring over the BashoBanjo app to trick and figure it out. But still
&gt; need more meat.
