&gt; until some upcoming changes land, and always on 0.14.x

When will the non-blocking key filtering land in a stable release?

&gt; The warning is there to discourage users from using list-keys, but it
&gt; doesn't prevent the operation from performing. Generally, list-keys can spam
&gt; a lot of your cluster, potentially blocking other operations (until some
&gt; upcoming changes land, and always on 0.14.x). You should still plan for the
&gt; day when list-keys will be too inconvenient even for the occasional query.
&gt;
&gt; Nevertheless, you can disable that warning message using:
&gt;
&gt; Riak.disable\\_list\\_keys\\_warnings = true

&gt;&gt; Seeing this in the log:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; "Full-bucket MapReduce, including key filters, invokes list-keys which is
&gt;&gt; an expensive operation that should not be used in production"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Assuming one is ok with having a query take a few seconds it's acceptable
&gt;&gt; to use a key filter in production, correct?
