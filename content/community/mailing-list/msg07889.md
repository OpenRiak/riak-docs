Hi, guys

The common situation is there is hundreds buckets, every bucket has
millions of kv pairs. But my question is that I want millions of
buckets , every bucket has kv pairs from dozens to hundreds.

So, in this condition, is Riak stiil a good solution, I means the
performance and second index search.

Best regards.
