Greetings,

First, since this is my first message to this list, thanks a lot for
publishing and maintaining Riak. I'm pretty excited about the
platform and the possibilities around it.

The question is: would there be any intention or on going work to
enable map-reduce jobs to be performed over a local interface in a
generic way, using e.g. Protocol Buffers over an Erlang port talking
to stdin/out of a process that could be written in any language?
