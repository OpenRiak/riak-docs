Riak is built in erlang and uses erlangs inter-process communication 
conventions to do its clustered magic. Aka, it works best in low 
latency, reliable networked environments.


If you are trying to solve a multi datacenter situation I would talk 
to the basho folks about their enterprise solution that works 
specifically in that environment.

Are you sure you want this? Riak will spread your data across all 
nodes in the cluster with no consideration for the network topology.

to see a concrete example from someone who has a setup that uses 
ssh to

tunnel between nodes in a riak cluster.
