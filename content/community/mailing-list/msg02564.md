Hello,

today I noticed that riak-search has a limit on 100.000 results for a
query (this can be tuned/changed by using the configuration). I am
only interested in 30 results, but understand that riak would have to
crawl through all results to be sure that it has the 30 best ones.

Since I want to use riak as key-value store on the one hand, but also
want to use it to query the entire database: is riaksearch the right
choice?

Regards,
 Jan
