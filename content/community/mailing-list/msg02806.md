3) Andrei Savu filed a ticket for making Riak play nice with Apache Whirr.

\\* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WHIRR-273

Andrei informed me (via Twitter) that he's not planning on tackling
this anytime soon but (according to him) it's not the most difficult
thing to hook up. If anyone wants to get ambitious, check out this
slide deck for inspiration ---&gt; http://slidesha.re/eGxZMn

4) Q --- If I want to dump/backup a snapshot of a single bucket, is
there a riak tool for it? (from tohava via #riak )

 A --- Check out http://contrib.basho.com/bucket\\_exporter.html

5) seancribbs and TB123 had a short convo about storing and searching
emails in #riak.

\\* Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/895589

6) Q --- If I have two computers and each runs riak can I be sure that
data is replicated on both computers? (from Taure via #riak)

 A --- Yes

7) hachiya and adamhunter had a quick chat in #riak about the best way
to import data into Riak.
