Riak is oblivious of your data's format, so it will store the literal
JSON. If you need more compact formats, you should marshal it yourself
(and probably send it as a different media type) before storing.

&gt;
&gt; Is number 1359401530 stored as array of bytes ['1', '3'.....] in 10 bytes,
&gt; or as binary value 01010001000001101101001000111010, in 4 bytes?
