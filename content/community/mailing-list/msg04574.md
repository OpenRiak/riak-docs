I've got a couple more questions:

1. Why is "pycurl" used in the http transport? What benefits does it
offer? Based on reading the code, I see no additional functionality,
so I don't understand why this complexity exists. I'd like to submit a
changeset that just removes it, but would like to understand if there
is a reason/history for using pycurl.

2. What is the policy around the API on the transports? As a concrete
example, I'd like to remove the HOST and PORT parameters from
RiakHttpTransport.http\\_request() (and remove them from the return
values of build\\_rest\\_path()). The parameters are always self.\\_host and
self.\\_port. Given the semantics of the transport, these would \\*never\\*
change... even by third party code that might call into these
functions. Would removing these parameters pose problems w.r.t API
stability guarantees?


Thanks,
