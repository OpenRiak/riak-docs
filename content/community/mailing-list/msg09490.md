If you need an index on a 64-bit value, you can get creative and store the
64-bit number as the hex representation of your 64-bit value in a binary
index. Seems to me that a bit of lateral thinking is easier than a breaking
change in either a database client or, worse, a database itself.

Example:

1619587083804677205 becomes the string 0x1679EDDF2CFD1455.

Using the powers of sorting, everything works out in the end.6

&gt;&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have a query regarding riak indexes. My current understanding is that
&gt;&gt; riak cannot index numbers whose representation needs more than 32 bits.
&gt;&gt; There is an issue on the basho repo to address this -
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/issues/112 . Do you have any
&gt;&gt; idea when it will be fixed ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've mentioned a way to work around this problem on a comment on the
&gt;&gt; issue. The work-around would not be efficient since JS code would have to
&gt;&gt; go through N rows to drop ones that do not fit a particular criteria on the
&gt;&gt; number. If there is a better solution to the problem, I'd like to hear your
&gt;&gt; thoughts on that also.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thank you for your time.
&gt;&gt; -Deepak
