I finally got the processes to start on machine reboot. I just have one
final question. When I execute 'riak-admin status' I get an error 'Node is
not running!'. But, when I execute 'sudo riak-admin status' I get the status
that I expect. Why in order to get the status do I need to be root? Also I
am assuming since I have a separate directory for each riak instance I am
assuming that 'riak-admin' in the rel directory will not work. Right?

Thank you.
