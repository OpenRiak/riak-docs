Hi Sean,

Thanks. Also, is there anyway to increase the javascript reduce phase
timeout? Doing some test M/R jobs, and the reduce phase doesn't seem
to honor the timeout passed in? Thought playing with streaming would
help that, but looks like not. Thank you in advance.

&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; When running map/reduce in streaming mode, since the results are from
&gt;&gt; the last phase (reduce) what is the significance of the phase key?
&gt;&gt; (e.g. {"phase":1,"data":[3]} )
