We're doing some maintenance on a Riak 1.2.1 cluster; it had two nodes in the 
cluster (50% ring each), and I used 'cluster join' to add a third node (should 
now be ~33% ring pending each).

Whilst it was transferring the ~33% of partitions to the new node (it had only 
just started), I told the node to leave again with 'cluster leave'.

I've now got a cluster with three nodes where 'member-status' reports the most 
recent addition as 'leaving', but the pending ring distribution is still at 
~33% each and it continues to transfer partitions to the 'new' node.

Should I expect this node to eventually leave, join or join-then-leave this 
cluster and can I interrupt this process some how?

Thanks,
Tom
