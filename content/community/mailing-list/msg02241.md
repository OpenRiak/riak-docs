Duff,

A little git history helps. It seems you added that spec back in November, I 
think around the time we were discussing how to properly deal with the "\\_type" 
property in #instantiate. Without remembering too much of the original context, 
the question seems to be: should it silently ignore attributes that no longer 
exist on the model or should it warn the programmer in some way that a property 
doesn't exist? The current code seems to favor the latter, in the form of a 
NoMethodError.

&gt; 
&gt; I'd also be fine doing things "manually" for awhile to give the code a
&gt; chance to reveal the abstraction. I'm still mulling on the best way
&gt; to even do it manually. :)
