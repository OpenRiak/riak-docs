I would run through pulling it down from git (or tarball), doing the
make thing and building the dev installs. then like turning them off
in separate terminals to show how the whole just continues to work.
it's easy for the audience to follow along with. between that and a
general intro to nosql you can easily kill 20 minutes before getting
into any riak specific stuff or dare i say app demos.

&gt; Thanks to both speedy responses. The audience is most likely
&gt; new to NOSQL, and probably never heard of riak.
&gt;
&gt; I want to talk about what Riak is and what makes Riak better
&gt; the others. I was trying to think of a good way to demo Riak.
&gt; But I'm not sure if it's feasible. I mean, I don't want to lug
&gt; 3-5 macminis just for the demo. Even if they are very tiny. :)
&gt;
&gt; Riak is a very good solution, but it doesn't have enough exposure.
&gt; I'm hoping to be able to do something to help with that.
