I am also experimenting with storing objects serialized as binary
data. I think this is a great way to use Riak, and you covered the
pros and cons.

The upcoming support for secondary indices will use metadata, so you
will be able to index your binary data too:

Basically you will pass tuples of index-name and index-data as
metadata to the put operation.
