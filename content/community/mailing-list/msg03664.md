Afternoon, Evening, Morning to All -

For today's Recap: slides, more slides, jobs, code, and more.

Also, I'll be in Portland, Oregon for about the next 24 hours. If
anyone is around and wants to tell me about the Riak cluster you've
just deployed, drinks/food are on me :) Get in touch.

Enjoy -

Worries" panel happening tomorrow at the HotStorage.
