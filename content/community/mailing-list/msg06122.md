Hi,

I had around 100 million entries in the riak cluster of 4 which was taking 9\\*4 
= 36 GB of RAM.
I deleted some 40 million keys from the cluster and still the size is same.
I restarted the cluster and still size is same.
Can anyone please tell why riak is still retaining its original size even after 
deletion.

Thanks in Advance

Vicky Khanna
