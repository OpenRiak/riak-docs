High performance updates to a single bucket/key space where ordering
isn't critical. Say, 5k TPS into a single bucket/key. Data is
written out such that it can be ordered later.

I'm aware of sharding/fragmenting/splitting and what not ... I'm
looking purely at intra-bucket performance. Yes, 5k is going to run
into a lot of contention; that's the point.

Options:
1) Read old data, [NewData|Olddata] and write it back out, dealing
with siblings as they arise, -or-
2) Go full sibling explosion (read: force it) and resolve the whole
thing at intervals, say, once per day, offline or on another system.
The logistics of this are doable in my case, so let's not worry about
them and just focus on raw TPS.

#1 has more round trips and still has siblings to deal with.
#2 takes up more space but you skip the pull/update/push in lieu of
"just push it, we'll deal with it later."

Thoughts from those in the know? How expensive, really, is forcing
the explosion? Has anyone done this (intentionally or not) and can
share what they ran into with real data sets?

Thanks!
