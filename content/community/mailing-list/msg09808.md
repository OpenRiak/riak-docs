Hi all,

I am running couple of months cluster of 5 Riak nodes on CentOs (Bitcask
backend).
Till today everything was fine, but today one of the nodes just stopped to
work.
When trying riak start/stop/ ... it just claims that node doesn't respond
to pings.
Restart of server didn't help. What should I do to recover this node?

Thanks,
 Pavel
