I have a riak mapred function which calls {ok, C} = riak:local\\_client and
then C:get (B,K) which is of different key than the incoming one,
however I noticed that same mapred is called whenever there is C:get (I have
2 gets and 2 times mapred is called), I checked by removing C:get then
things worked as expected. Is that of correct behavior?
