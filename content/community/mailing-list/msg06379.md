One note, we do provide an excellent Java client, that would probably be 
preferable over the javascript client if you are already working from the Java 
world.

And personally I think it would be great to see a Riak connector for Gora.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I've recently been discussing the possibility of working on a gora-riak store 
&gt; for the Apache Gora project [1]. As gora is written in Java we would use the 
&gt; riak-javascript-client API for the Riak logic, the aim being to provide all 
&gt; the goodies that Gora offers to the Riak community...
&gt; 
&gt; Would something of this nature be a valuable asset?
