Hello,

I am just starting out with Riak 
and am switching over from MongoDB. I have many GB of data in either 
JSON or XML and was wondering if there is a way to import this in a bulk
 manner to Riuk. For MongoDB, I put each json file in one text file with 
each json document on one line and use mongoimport to upload to a 
collection. Is there an equivalent thing to mongoimport in Riuk? If not,
 how can I get this data in. Also, is it ok to interact with Riuk using 
Ruby as I do not know Erlang?

Lastly, am I right to assume that a bucket is similar to a collection in 
mongodb and the key/objects are the documents?

Thanks very much for the help.
Mark
