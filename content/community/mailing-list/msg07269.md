1. Add other data types like lists and sets. With lists, features
like blocking pop would be great.


Please consider how such a feature would behave in the presence of a
network partition. This \\*is\\* possible, but there are significant
consistency or performance tradeoffs required.

Conceptually, a bucket is a list of documents. So you could handle lists 
and sets in a similar fashion during a network partition. Each side 
would see its own list, be able to add and remove. When the network was 
restored, it could merge the lists (with deletes). There are definitely 
intricacies to work through, but I think it's possible.

MongoDB also has capped collections which keep a fixed number of
documents.


Strictly speaking, they don't.


Can you please elaborate?

Thanks,
Paul
