Hi Mårten,

We've migrated our issue tracking to GitHub issues, so most bugs have been 
moved to there. This particular bug represents a feature request- we've 
migrated those to another tool that is currently only visible to Basho 
employees. Some of the content there probably should be visible to the 
community as well, but we're just not there yet.

&gt; I've been watching the "Delete all keys in a bucket"[1] issue which
&gt; just got closed with the status "CLOSED MIGRATED". What does this
&gt; status indicate?
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; cheers, m.
