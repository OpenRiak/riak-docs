Sam,

The location of replicas, for operational and simplicity reasons, is opaque
to clients. This may change in the future, but at best it might be
informational only, e.g. "talk to this node when using this key". The
object size (without metadata) is given in the Content-Length header,
naturally. However, you cannot determine the size without fetching the
object.

&gt; Specifically what I'm interested in is the nodes of the cluster the object
&gt; is stored on and the objects size. Is this possible ether with the HTTP API
&gt; or command line console?
