I've been running Riak in production on FreeBSD for about 3 months now under 
heavy use without any issues. I've actually been thinking of creating and 
submitting an official port for it.

It's been a bit so I'll have to run through my notes but I'd be willing to post 
the process I undertook if you would like.
