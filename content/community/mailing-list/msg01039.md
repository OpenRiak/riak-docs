Ok. Thanks. You are right. It was SE Linux.

&gt; This looks like an issue with SE Linux on Centos. Can you try disabling it
&gt; with the following command:
&gt; setenforce 0
&gt;
&gt; If that works you will need to disable SE Linux at boot.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I have Riak of last version from bitbucket (http://hg.basho.com/riak/src),
&gt; which I want to install on my server with CentOS 5.5 Final.
&gt; I executed "make rel" and all code was compiled without errors.
&gt; Then I started riak and, it seems, it was started without errors too.
&gt;
&gt; But when I tried to test node I got:
&gt;
&gt; myhost# bin/riak-admin test
&gt; Node is not running!
&gt;
&gt; There is following errors in erlang.log.1 - http://pastebin.com/Ls0s8rXb
&gt;
&gt; sasl-error.log - http://pastebin.com/DvZYy1vU
&gt;
&gt; Did anybody get similar problem with Riak on CentOS/
