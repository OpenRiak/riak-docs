Hello,

I had an earlier project using webmachine. I added the riak dependencies,
which also use webmachine, and now my existing webmachine code is broken.

I found a related blog
postabout
this issue, but things are still not working despite the dispatch\\_list
looking correct at runtime. I can take out the riak apps from my rel file
to get the original functionality working (but riak not working obviously).


Any ideas how I can troubleshoot?

Thanks,

Kenny
