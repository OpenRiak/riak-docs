Been seeing some busy\\_dist\\_port errors lately in our riak logs and curious
if it's anything to worry about.

Here is a specific instance of the log msg
https://gist.github.com/881598dc29ca168dba34

More info on our setup
\\* 9 node cluster (dedicated)
\\* Ubuntu 10.04
\\* 32GB ram
\\* SSDs
\\* 256K block size, 1G leveldb cache
\\* Key values are typically 80K or less
\\* Appx 1-2k gets/s to the cluster
\\* N = 2, R = 1, W = 1

Have also been using a bit of swap lately on these machines.

Any advice appreciated.

Thanks,
D
