Chris,

What is the content of the erlang.log files? Certain errors can occur
before lager is running and the erlang log files are where to find them.
 You could also run ./riak console.

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I was following the Riak Fast Track and setting up a dev environment and
&gt; ran into a problem I am having trouble solving so far. When I try to run 
&gt; \\*./riak
&gt; start \\*I'm getting a generic error saying there was an "Error" reading
&gt; the app.config file. I've navigated there via an Erlang shell and in using
&gt; file:consult/1 I was able to read the terms in just fine. I've been looking
&gt; but haven't found a solution for my particular problem as the similar
&gt; questions surrounding the app.config file had additional error messages
&gt; which indicated the problems. I'm running 64bit version of Ubuntu 12.04
&gt; LTS, Riak 1.2, and Erlang R15B01. Has anyone had/solved a similar issue?
&gt;
&gt; Chris.
