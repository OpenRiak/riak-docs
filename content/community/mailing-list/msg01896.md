Hi,

I am very new to Riak and I am reading what I can find on the web. I 
have noticed two presentation available at:


 http://www.slideshare.net/hemulen/introducing-riak
 http://www.slideshare.net/seancribbs/schema-design-for-riak

Unfortunately, when I tried to download them, I get a .KEY file, which 
is Mac specific. I am on Vista 7. There does not seem to be any tools 
available to convert these to PDF or PPT. OpenOffice (which is capable 
of opening many many types of file) does not seem to be able to read 
.key files.


Is it possible to get a PDF version of these? Or can they be made 
available somewhere online? It would lower the barrier to entry for 
new-comers.


My other question/remark is: there does not seem to be a downloadable 
version of Riak for Windows. Is there a technical reason for this or is 
it a 'religious' issue? I am not especially pro or against Windows, but 
not providing a version for it amounts to alienating from a large part 
of the community who might be interested in Riak. It is another barrier 
to entry for the development of this technology.


Thanks,

JVerstry
