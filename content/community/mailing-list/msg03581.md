You should be able to delete that with the Erlang client.

{ok, C} = riak:local\\_client(),
C:delete(&lt;&lt;"110605172211401242"&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;).

&gt; I accidentally created an entry with a key of "" (blank) with the PB client. 
&gt; Oddly enough, it let me do it and I see it in the list of keys:
&gt; 
&gt; "keys":["110605172211401242",""]
&gt; 
&gt; But I can't delete it now.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a way to delete this entry (besides deleting the bitcask directory)?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
