Francisco,

When you say "doesn't show up on the search query results \\*anymore\\*" does
that imply that at one time they did? I'm trying to understand if the
index entries appear to have been lost or if it was never successfully
written in the first place.

Any errors you see in the logs may be relevant. Feel free to include
snippets of anything you find.

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; I am running (still) 0.14.2 in production, and using Riak Search to
&gt; index certain buckets. Those buckets have the Riak Search pre-commit
&gt; hook enabled.
&gt;
&gt; Once in a while I get complaints of missing documents from my clients,
&gt; and it just happened.
&gt;
&gt; I checked and the document:
&gt; - is correctly stored in Riak
&gt; - doesn't show up on the search query results \\*anymore\\*
&gt;
&gt; My workaround before was to go through every key in the bucket and
&gt; save it again, as to trigger the search hook. Of course, this is less
&gt; than ideal.
&gt;
&gt; Should I be looking for something specific in the logs? What could be
&gt; going on here?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Francisco
