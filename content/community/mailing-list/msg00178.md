When doing a POST against a bucket without indicating a key, riak 
auto-generates a 27 characted mixedcase alphanum (with possibly + 2 other chars 
for radix(64) ) unique ID.... How does it do that? What's the seed? What 
guarantees of uniqueness are there? I take it even if there was a conflict riak 
would default to it's vclock behavior... 

Interestingly, it looks like there are "contained" links set at the bucket 
level for each of the keys created. How does that affect performance? like lets 
say i wanted to use riak auto gen'd keys in a bucket that could have tens of 
thousands of records in it... Would that block a GET on the bucket over http 
once you have enough keys in the bucket? I think the limit is an 8k header.

And what if you wanted to modify props on a bucket, would you have to get the 
bucket first, with links header, and then re-write with the new props body and 
old links header? I thought you had to write link+body because if you only 
write body you lose the links.

Thanks, Alexander
