Just a brief follow up -- I have yet to hear from anyone that they are
using Innostore in a production setting. As such, we will NOT be
releasing Innostore as part of the Riak 1.2 release later this month.

Thanks!

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; As the mid-July release of Riak looms large, the Basho team has been
&gt; discussing our continued support of the Innostore backend. Embedded
&gt; InnoDB was long ago abandoned by Oracle. We have not been actively
&gt; working on it either.
&gt;
&gt; We believe that alternative designs (like LevelDB) are the future and
&gt; want to focus our energies there. The data we have available
&gt; indicates that Riak users are no longer actively using the Innostore
&gt; backend. Based on the above, we would like to deprecate it.
&gt;
&gt; The big question: is anyone out there still using Innostore?
&gt;
&gt; Your feedback is appreciated!
