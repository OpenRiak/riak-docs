Yup, list-keys and list-buckets does this for us too, since Riak 0.14. 
Bitcask, 6 nodes, physical hardware, 1024 partitions, 100-300 million 
keys with n\\_val 3.

We are currently running Riak 1.1 in production, using LevelDB
with snappy compression and yesterday we ran into a strange
issue where listing the buckets via:

$ curl "http://east-riak-001:8098/riak?buckets=true"

Doing this caused curl to hang indefinitely, and the target node to
freak out.
Symptoms included a massive increase in system load (2-3x), FSM timings
exploding
from ~30-50 msec to 500 - 5000 msec, and most of the APIs becoming
totally unresponsive.

We ran this on a few nodes on the cluster, which basically brought
everything to a halt. Our solution was to just reboot all the nodes, at
which point things returned to normal.

Curious if anybody else has experienced this.
