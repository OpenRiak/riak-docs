&gt; Windows was once POSIX compliant for about 15 minutes, then Microsoft changed 
&gt; their mind. What this means is that you need to write wrappers around how 
&gt; Windows handles file access. Windows also uses a completely different 
&gt; networking API. Since Riak relies heavily on both network and I/O, porting it 
&gt; to Windows is problematic.

Actually, the BSD sockets layer is pretty close to the standard on
Windows, and the Erlang VM hides those differences from the code anyway
(and we don't do any socket programming in any of the NIFs, to my
knowledge).

I agree that the busted file API would be very problematic, though.
