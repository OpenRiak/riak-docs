Hello :)

I'd like to see how riak is distributing my data. For instance, when I tell
it to replicate to two of three nodes, I'd like to go in and see which
nodes the data exists on.

Is there an api command that will just show all the data that exists in the
cluster and on which node(s) it resides?

Thanks
