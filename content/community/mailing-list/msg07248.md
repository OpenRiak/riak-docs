I'm not talking so much about features in Riak itself. I'm more
interested in the other resources, tools, docs, processes, etc., that


I may have missed it, but my customer is using CouchDB (guilty for 
introducing it) and regarding a move to Riak one question that was 
raised is the lack of a "Riak workbench". CouchDB has something very 
simple, the Futon, but it is also lacking IMHO.


So I think lots of developers feel a bit intimidated by the fact that 
they can't easily "browse and query" the db and do simple manipulations 
etc. A good solid tool for that would probably be of great help for 
adoption.


And yes, I agree, it is not really important for real production use of 
Riak, but we are talking about \\*adoption\\* and then it's fairly important.
