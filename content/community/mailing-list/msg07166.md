Thank you for confirming that. Much appreciated.

&gt; it seemed to be encoding one PB message per search result and
&gt; spending quite a bit of time doing it
&gt; …snip…
&gt; So if there's an opportunity
&gt; for batching the search results, that seems like it would be a big
&gt; improvement as well.
&gt;
&gt; (It looks like that is currently up to whatever process is sending the
&gt; results in the first place. But maybe it would be a good idea for the
&gt; pb socket to accumulate M/R results until it reaches some threshold of
&gt; bytes to send...calling term\\_to\\_binary to estimate is pretty fast.)

Indeed, you're correct here as well. I think there was a TODO about
just this at some point, but it seems to have been lost in an
issue-tracker shuffle. I've refiled it at
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/issues/312

Thanks,
Bryan
