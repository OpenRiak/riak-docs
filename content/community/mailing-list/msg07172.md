Hi gibraltar,

A few things come to mind:

\\* Sean Cribbs and Mathias Meyer wrote an app called Riaktant [1] that uses
riak-js. (Note: this hasn't been touched in about a year so you might have
to update it in various parts.)
\\* The Riak Handbook [2] has some extensive code examples using riak-js.

Hope that helps. Have fun.

&gt; hello,
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if there's a reference implementation for Riak. Something that
&gt; shows best practices while developing for Riak, e.g. what error messages to
&gt; check after each operation, how to handle them, etc. I would prefer
&gt; javascript (for node.js) but any implementation is fine. I am aware that
&gt; there are endless possibilities of how one can use Riak, but a common theme
&gt; of interaction with Riak commands could've helped for the uninitiated.
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
