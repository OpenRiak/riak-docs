Thank you for these very helpful responses.

To Andrew: I suspected I would have to set something in app.config, but was
unsure what to set.

To Alexander: I do also have nginx already running (as a front-end proxy for
Jetty), so I will set it up as a proxy for Riak as well.

&gt; Testing aside, I would not bind a production riak to an external

&gt; intermediary like nginx.

&gt; &gt; Hi Stefan,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You need to configure Riak to listen on the right interface. You are
&gt; trying
&gt; &gt; to hit it from 127.0.0.1 which is only available from the local machine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you set web\\_ip to 0.0.0.0 in app.config for riak\\_core it will listen
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; all interfaces. Then you can try to hit it with a curl remotely using
&gt; &gt; myhost.com from your browser.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi -
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; SUMMARY:
&gt; &gt;&gt; This may be a silly question but... after installing Riak via ssh, can I
&gt; &gt;&gt; (or should I) test \\*remotely\\* it from a browser?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
