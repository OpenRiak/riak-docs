Hi Jeremiah,

Thanks for your quick response. But, we also want to do a query on the
bucket, so yes implementing links if you want to pull one object makes
sense, but if you want to do query. Only way to do this to use MapReduce.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

&gt;You can link walk without MapReduce - the RpbContent object returned by
&gt;the ProtocolBuffers API should include the immediate level of links.
&gt;Otherwise, many clients support using HTTP requests to perform link walks
&gt;of arbitrary depths.
&gt;
&gt;The bigger question is: what are you trying to accomplish?

&gt;&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We were just wondering what is the best possible way to model 1 Â­ N
&gt;&gt;relationships in Riak. We know that there are links but the mapreduce is
&gt;&gt;too slow. So, we moved towards using RiakSearch but it seems that
&gt;&gt;modeling relationships and having lists in riak search KV object doesn't
&gt;&gt;quiet do the job.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So, we were looking for some guidance on this front.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks
