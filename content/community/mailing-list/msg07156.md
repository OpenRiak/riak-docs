Ya, that is exactly what I had in mind. A non data storage cluster member. 
Specifically to act as additional read/computation asset.

&gt; When using the Java transport client (as opposed to the HTTP/JSON
&gt; interface), you actually become a cluster member as a non-data node.
&gt; You can also add any number of nodes to the cluster as non-data nodes
&gt; that then participate in general processing.

&gt;&gt; I think that being able to have a native erlang interface to a riak cluster

&gt;&gt; benefit from having access to data at the speed of network but not actually
&gt;&gt; be a member of the storage pool.

&gt;&gt; Just watched Rich Hickey discussing similar concepts employed in his new

&gt;&gt; Worth the 30min.

&gt;&gt; Mike,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The native Erlang client was never designed to be used in this fashion, as
&gt;&gt; you are finding out first hand. You are correct in that some operations
&gt;&gt; assume they are running on the Riak VM, e.g. mapred\\_dynamic\\_inputs\\_stream.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Normally I would say not to establish a Erlang dist connection to the Riak
&gt;&gt; cluster but given you need a work around for the performance issue it seems
&gt;&gt; to be your only good choice ATM. You can use `rpc:call` to invoke the
&gt;&gt; mapred queries.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In case anyone else is wondering, the answer is no, the native client
&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't fully usable from a non-Riak node.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I started a hidden node and connected to one of my Riak nodes using
&gt;&gt;&gt; riak:client\\_connect. The returned client is able to successfully
&gt;&gt;&gt; execute Client:get(Bucket, Key) (and probably other simple things like
&gt;&gt;&gt; put/delete), but it fails on mapred with a {modfun, ...} input.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is that the native client tries to run the input function
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the local node, rather than the node the client points to, which of
&gt;&gt;&gt; course won't work unless the local node is participating in the Riak
&gt;&gt;&gt; cluster.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it OK to use Riak's native erlang client from an erlang node that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; connected to a Riak cluster via normal erlang distribution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (net\\_adm:ping etc.), but isn't participating in the Riak cluster? I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wondering if e.g. Riak makes any assumptions about nodes listed in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nodes(), or the nodes of processes running client code, that would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; break if a node isn't running Riak.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm trying to figure out a fallback strategy in case I can't resolve
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; performance issues I'm seeing with the protocol buffers client (see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other thread about slow searches). The scariest option would be to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run my application on the same nodes as Riak, which seems like it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would complicate operations too much. Or if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; connected-but-not-participating nodes aren't a good idea, maybe my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; application nodes could each start a slave node with -hidden, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would then connect to Riak and act as a proxy?
