I believe that at present that is the case, yes. 

For the InnoStore and LevelDB backends it doesn't have to be that way; but for 
data compatibility reasons it would be an incompatible change for inno. The 
LevelDB backend does store entries sorted by "Bucket+Key", so it should be 
relatively easy to change the backend to do something smarter.
