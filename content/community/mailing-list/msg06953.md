Martin,

You are correct, these messages are fine to ignore.

&gt; Hi

&gt; We're using Riak 1.1.1 (on Ubuntu, built from source) and are seeing a number 
&gt; of errors raised regularly in the error logs during mapreduce. I think I 
&gt; remember reading a post on this forum a while ago that these error messages 
&gt; are nothing to worry about, that they are just a result of one aspect of the 
&gt; mapreduce processing shutting down before receiving a normal shutdown message 
&gt; from another process - hence the {sink\\_died, normal}. The comments in the 
&gt; source code where this error is generated seem to back this up. Indeed, the 
&gt; mapreduce operations in question all completed just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone from Basho please confirm that this is the case and that we're 
&gt; safe to ignore them? Here are the entries in error.log:
&gt; 
&gt; 2012-03-13 23:25:12.810 [error] &lt;0.10984.0&gt; gen\\_fsm &lt;0.10984.0&gt; in state

&gt; Thanks and regards,
