Hi All,

The Community Code page on the wiki [1] is out-of-date. This is my
fault; you've been writing too much code. :)

Tom and I are going to spend some time this coming week trying to
bring it up to speed with what's current, but if you've got some code
or are using something that should be listed but isn't, don't be
scared to contribute [2].

Thanks for your help.
