Hi Jonathan,

Can you verify that the machines otherwise see each other? (Can you ping or
ssh between the three machines?)

Can you verify that you can use telnet to connect to the different open
ports from each machine?

If so, can you double check your usage of `riak-admin join NODENAME`? How
does it respond?

Finally, can you run `riak attach` to attach to an Erlang shell on one of
the nodes, and run \\*net\\_adm:ping('rdevX@192.168.1.Y').\\* for each of the
three node names?

Hopefully that tells us where things are failing.

Best,
Rusty

&gt; I've attempted a ping from riak console, comes back pang.

&gt; Any suggestions?
