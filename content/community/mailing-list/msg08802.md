I think, I've figured out that the only way to accomplish what I'm shooting
for is to decouple the persistance layer from the business logic of my
message class. That way I can embed a message object into any other class,
including a "PersistedMessage" class.

I believe that riak search would do the trick, but I believe a straight
lookup will be considerably faster.

&gt; &gt; I want to create a model that I can save to its own bucket, but also be
&gt; able to embed it in another model. Is this possible with ripple?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Specifically I want to create a Message model, that I can save and
&gt; lookup easily. I also want to embed a copy of that class in a
&gt; ReceivedMessage class. I would like to work with these models as such:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; message = Message.new
&gt; &gt; message.body = 'foo'
&gt; &gt; message.save!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; received = ReceivedMessage.new
&gt; &gt; received.messages &lt;&lt; message
&gt; &gt; received.save!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; By doing this I know I have 2 copies of the message, but I'm alright
&gt; with that. I'm optimizing for reads not storage space.
&gt; &gt; My endgame is that I want to look up messages without looking through
&gt; the recieved messages, and I want a user to quickly view all received
&gt; messages without looking up each individual message.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
