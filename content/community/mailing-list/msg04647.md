Matt,

Yes you will. The majority of our new/deeply refactored features have
"legacy" modes. As you do your rolling upgrade, keep legacy\\_gossip as true
on the 1.0 nodes, then when all are up on 1.0, you can switch them over to
using the new gossip protocol in a similar fashion. Joe can comment on
whether it is necessary to restart them to change the gossip protocol.

&gt; These new clustering changes sounds excellent.

&gt; Will we still be able to do a rolling upgrade from 0.14.2?

&gt;&gt; Given that 1.0 prerelease packages are now available, I wanted to
&gt;&gt; mention some changes to Riak's clustering capabilities in 1.0. In
&gt;&gt; particular, there are some subtle semantic differences in the
&gt;&gt; riak-admin commands. More complete docs will be updated in the near
&gt;&gt; future, but I hope a quick email suffices for now.
