Hey riak-users,

We have just released version 1.0.3 of the Ruby client for Riak, which is
available on Rubygems [1] and Github [2]. This release includes an
essential update for the test-server functionality, adding support for
secondary indexes, and fixes a number of other bugs. Please read the
official release notes [3] for additional information.

Cheers!
