I have read about links and link walking in "Seven Databases in Seven Weeks". 
But they concentrate their coverage with examples using curl and the REST 
interface. I was wondering if someone either has used CorrugatedIron support 
for these features or could point me to some more in depth documentation on the 
subject? I have looked at CorrugatedIron.org and there is minimal documentation 
there. I was hoping more for some kind of correlation between the REST 
interface calls and the methods in CI that support the functionality. Again 
sorry about the specific driver related question but this forum was as close as 
I could get. Thank you.
