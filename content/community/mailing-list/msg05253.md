Thanks Kelly. You were spot-on. I had upgraded app.config on my other two
nodes but had missed one.

So, I updated app.config, restarted all cluster nodes, and reran the same
query. It now looks like a pipe error:

Ideas?

Jim,

Looks like you are possibly using both the legacy key listing option and the
legacy map reduce. Assuming all your nodes are on Riak 1.0, check your
app.config files on all nodes and make sure mapred\\_system is set to pipe and
legacy\\_keylisting is set to false. If that's not already the case you should
see better performance. If you are still getting the same or similar errors
with those setting in place, please respond with what they are so we can
look into it more. Thanks.

Kelly
