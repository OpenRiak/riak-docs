LevelDB is a nice option with a key space that will not fit in memory. Whether 
or not bitcask will work for you depends on total memory capacity of the 
cluster and N value. Recommend using the bitcask capacity planner to see if it 
is a suitable backed for your hardware+data combination.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I did a quick computation, and figured that I need to be able to manage a 
&gt; minimum 5 billion keys roughly 80bytes each. Since Bitcask needs all keys in 
&gt; memory, that's a lot of memory. How does it handle swapping? I typically 
&gt; only need a portion of those keys available at a given time, so swapping them 
&gt; out would be fine if it was intelligent about that and loading it back in. 
&gt; Meaning that if it has to pull in the whole index to add a new key, that 
&gt; would be an issue for me. I typically need to add new keys pretty quickly 
&gt; and then access the most recent ones. The older ones could swap out without 
&gt; too much worry.
&gt; 
&gt; Would LevelDB help with this?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
