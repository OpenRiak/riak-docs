Afternoon, Evening, Morning to All,

Hope everyone had a great weekend.

For today's Recap: new riak\\_core slides, a new version of Ripple, a
Riak job, more great Spring Data work from J. Brisbin, and some gists
from #riak around Search.

Enjoy,

Riak Recap for Dec. 10 -12

1) Over the weekend I was alerted to the existence of these great
riak\\_core slides that Rusty Klophaus used for a recent erlang factory
talk.

Enjoy ---&gt;

2) Sean Cribbs pushed v0.8.3 of Ripple.

Release notes and docs here ---&gt;
http://seancribbs.github.com/ripple/file.RELEASE\\_NOTES.html

3) For anyone in or around Vancouver, BC, looks like there's a job in
your area that might be worthwhile to check out.

Details here ---&gt; http://twitter.com/#!/smacintyre/status/14449960263090176

4) J. Brisbin continues to do awesome stuff:

\\* He updated the RabbitMQ webhooks plugin, complete with an example
config for storing AMPQ messages in Riak ---&gt;
https://github.com/jbrisbin/rabbitmq-webhooks

\\* He also pushed java.io and Spring IO Resource abstractions to Riak
springdata ---&gt; https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-keyvalue

5) Q --- If I change the CAP (n,r,w) values in the app.config after
creating buckets (with the default values), will these be updated
automatically? (from \\_Luca\\_ via #riak)

 A --- No. This would take a full cluster restart. (It should be
noted that changing n\\_val after you're storing data is not
recommended.)

6) kotoko, reiddraper, seancribbs and roidrage had a worthwhile convo
in #riak that started with "How do people handle the Riak-Search
flattening nested JSON documents?"

Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/739781

7) garrys\\_game and jrecursive had a quick Q & A in #riak about using
Riak Search for Unix epoch timestamps range querying.

Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/739795

8) Reminder for anyone in or around San Fran: the December Riak meetup
is this Thursday. If you're planning on attending and have not
registered yet, please do so. I can't be held responsible if the
pizza/beer runs out and your name wasn't on the guest list :)

Details here ---&gt;

9) I'll be at Node.js Camp tomorrow (http://camp.nodejs.org/). If
you're there and want to meetup, let me know.
