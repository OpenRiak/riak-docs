Sorry if this is the wrong place. Is there a specific email address I
can send to for buglets I found on Basho doc site?

 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Basic-Riak-API-Operations/

Does not mention "GET /buckets/bucket\\_name" that this page does:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/apis/http/HTTP-Get-Bucket-Properties/

I am trying to convince our engineers to move from mongo to riak, and
running various doc snafus.

Thanks.

Tin
