Riak Recap for September 9 - 11
========================

1) Mark Cavage wrote a lengthy post on just about everything you would
ever want to know about LDAP. More importantly he explains why he's
working on it at Joyent and why they are using Riak with LDAP.

2) Basho COO Tony Falco was in the Wall St. Journal talking about the
history of Basho and Riak, why Riak is so compelling. Basho is part of
the "Small Business, Large Innovation" competition the WSJ is running
and we could use your vote.

Software Engineers to work on their infrastructure (and there's a lot
of Riak involved). Details here ---&gt; http://truesef.com/jobs/sse.html
