As you already know, Mr Phillips, I will be there. Now everyone else knows. 
Good times.

&gt;&gt; I mentioned this in Friday's Recap but I figured it was worth asking
&gt;&gt; again: anyone going to Surge [1] next week? I'll be there along with
&gt;&gt; Sean Cribbs, Ian Plosker, Ryan Zezeski, and a few other members of the
&gt;&gt; Basho team. If you're attending and haven't already notified me, let
&gt;&gt; me know (or I'll have trouble buying you a beverage or two).
