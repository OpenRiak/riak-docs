Yes, the latest eleveldb now builds Snappy and you can enable/disable
with {compression, true|false} setting.

This will be part of 1.1 release of Riak (in next few weeks).

&gt; Are we any closer to being able to turn on Snappy compression of the
&gt; eleveldb backend? Â It would be rather helpful when using Riak in EC2 and the
&gt; crappy IOPS.
