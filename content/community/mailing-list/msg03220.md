Hi,

Sorry for the Lil Kim reference on the subject line, I couldn't help it :-)

In the links documentation on wiki.basho.com, it says:
"this can substitute as a lightweight graph database, as long as the number
of links attached to a given key are kept reasonably low"

What's considered reasonably low here? tens? hundreds? thousands? millions?

Has anyone published benchmarks or stress-testing results of this anywhere
for me to take a look?

Thank you,
