There is no limit to the amount of buckets a cluster can handle. The 
only consideration I know of is when using non default bucket 
properties (like bucket specific N vals). The reason being that non 
default values are chatted around the cluster in the gossip channel.

Is there a practical (or hard) limit to the number of buckets a riak

application could result in ~80,000 buckets. Is that a reasonable 
number?


Thanks,
