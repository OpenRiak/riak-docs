Out of interest, to those of us who are rusty on their shell scripting,
could you share the aforementioned script?

&gt; &gt; Hi
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Help. I want to store few thousands of small png (each of them will just
&gt; be 10K) into riak.
&gt; &gt; But I find that is really slow (1 to 2 second for one png).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Currently, I use a bash script to find and loop the directory
&gt; &gt; And curl PUT the png onto riak.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do we have a bulk upload or will it be faster if I use erlang or or
&gt; driver?
&gt; &gt; I need to upload 1000 small png within one minute. Can it be done?
&gt;
&gt; I imagine it is possible. I just managed to do it in 10seconds on my
&gt; laptop, single node with n=3 and r=2 using xargs and curl to put in
&gt; parallel.
&gt;
&gt; How many nodes do you have? What is your n-val?
&gt;
&gt; cheers
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Currently, I am on riak 1.01 and levelDB backend.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks a lot!
