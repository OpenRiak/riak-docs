I should have added that I want to avoid busy waiting.

If the object doesn't exist, some other process will be working to populate
it, and I don't want to keep on polling the database to see if the other
process is done.

Moreover, the process that wants the result doesn't have a direct
connection to the process that will be creating the result, so I'm
wondering if I can use riak to facilitate them rendezvousing with each
other. (Imaging, for instance, that the requesting process is a web
generated AJAX request, and the process creating the result is a backend
server process.)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking of something that works like this... if a GET call is made
&gt;&gt; for an object that doesn't exist, the call blocks until the object is
&gt;&gt; created.
