Hey guys,

I currently have an app that uses the RiakClient/RiakObject interface
(fetch(),store(),etc) in lieu of the
IRiakClient/IRiakObject/FetchObject interface.

Is there any way for me to continue using my code with
PBClusterConfig? It looks like I need to move to using IRiakClient in
order to take advantage of PBClusterConfig, is that so?

Any insight would be appreciated, thanks!

Ahmed
