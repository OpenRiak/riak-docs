A go-getter by the name of Kyle Quest did manage to port Riak 0.13 to run
Windows and put out a screencast about it four months back:

I believe Kyle is still on the list. Perhaps he can share some details on
the port...

&gt; &gt; Windows was once POSIX compliant for about 15 minutes, then Microsoft
&gt; changed their mind. What this means is that you need to write wrappers
&gt; around how Windows handles file access. Windows also uses a completely
&gt; different networking API. Since Riak relies heavily on both network and
&gt; I/O, porting it to Windows is problematic.
&gt;
&gt; Actually, the BSD sockets layer is pretty close to the standard on
&gt; Windows, and the Erlang VM hides those differences from the code anyway
&gt; (and we don't do any socket programming in any of the NIFs, to my
&gt; knowledge).
&gt;
&gt; I agree that the busted file API would be very problematic, though.
