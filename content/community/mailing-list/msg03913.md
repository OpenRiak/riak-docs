Has anyone been able to get Riak running on CentOS 5.6? I installed
Erlang 14B03 from source, have tried compiling from github, downloading
the source tar, and even tried to install from the RHEL and Fedora RPM
package and each have failed.

Any thoughts?


Why not just use the .el5 RPMs? They include erlang. I'm running the 
riak-search version, but either should work on Centos5.6.
