I mentioned this in Friday's Recap but I figured it was worth asking
again: anyone going to Surge [1] next week? I'll be there along with
Sean Cribbs, Ian Plosker, Ryan Zezeski, and a few other members of the
Basho team. If you're attending and haven't already notified me, let
me know (or I'll have trouble buying you a beverage or two).
