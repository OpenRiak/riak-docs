Are there special instructions for installing the rpm version of 
riaksearch: riak-search-0.14.2-1.el5.x86\\_64.rpm?
The init script seems to want a riaksearch user that it doesn't create 
and then fails to sudo to the riak user that it does add.


# service riaksearch start
Starting Riak Search: Attempting to restart script through sudo -u riak
sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo
