Ryan,

I don't have any recommendations on how to compose your keys, just to note
that if using bitcask they are stored in memory so you may have to watch out
for that in regards to key length and # of objects.

What I really wanted to tell you is that secondary indices should arrive in
some form in the near future. Using composite keys with key filtering
should be able to fill in for the time being. Another option is to use
Search and enable indexing on your buckets.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; I have some questions regarding key composition and secondary indexes.
&gt;
&gt; Key filters seem really useful, and because of this, I find myself
&gt; designing keys that have (perhaps) too many elements within them.
&gt;
&gt; - Are there any best practices concerning key composition?
&gt; - Does the composition of a key in a bitcask setup influence speed? (It
&gt; seems to in 
&gt; Innodb
&gt; )
&gt; - Is there a maximum key length?
&gt;
&gt; Lastly, do integrated secondary indexes exist in Riak yet? This link
&gt; suggests they are 
&gt; coming but
&gt; I've been unable to find any other evidence of their arrival.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Ryan
