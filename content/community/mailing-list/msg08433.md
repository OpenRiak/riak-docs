Hello,

I am implementing a client for nodejs, and I don't fully understand how 
a client should take care of vector clocks.


http://wiki.basho.com/Vector-Clocks.html mentions that

a well behaved client that does a read (to get the current vector clock) 
before a write.


So whenever a user wants to write a key, the client should first fetch 
that key and keep the vector clock to be referenced in the put request?


The same applies when allow\\_mult is disabled?

Thank you,
danmilon.
