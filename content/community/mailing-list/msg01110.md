Kevin and Sean,

2010/9/20 Kevin Smith :
&gt; js\\_reload will force a reload of all the Javascript VMs. This will dump all 
&gt; state, including any accumulated anonymous functions. We do cache anonymous 
&gt; functions to reduce the number of JS calls we have to make but it's possible 
&gt; there's a bug in the change detection logic. I will take a look in that code 
&gt; and see if we're doing anything obviously wrong. What version of Riak are you 
&gt; using?

Oh, ok. I'm running on tip from 2 weeks ago or so:

 Bug 640: remove extra net\\_kernel:hidden\\_connect\\_node() call
branch: default
commit: (clean)
update: (current)

2010/9/20 Sean Cribbs :
&gt; Also, your query may have hit some "not\\_found" objects - you'll probably want 
&gt; to filter those out in the reduce phase using values = 
&gt; Riak.filterNotFound(values); That could be the source of some errors.

Good advice; well, it's locally-run test data that happens never to be
removed - but maybe at some point a vnode is lacking a value that
returns a not\\_found that when not caught throws this failed\\_reduce? No
idea how likely that is. I filter these out in most of my reduces
anyway ( if not v.not\\_found then ... ).

Thanks again.
Francisco
