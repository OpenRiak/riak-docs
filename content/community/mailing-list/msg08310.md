Hello Julian - 

 A new version of the riak-erlang-client [1] was recently released that 
changes riakc\\_pb\\_socket:search/\\* to use protobuffs instead of map/reduce. Give 
that a shot first and let us know if it works for you.

Cheers -
Dave

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Recently, we upgraded our Riak cluster to 1.2. I hear that one of our buckets 
&gt; has been wiped and reloaded, but our index (Riak search is enabled) may not 
&gt; be in a consistent state. This has led to an error in code using 
&gt; riak-erlang-client 1.2, shown below.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the intriguing things I find is that the exception is listed as 
&gt; occuring in one of my own processes that is doing json decoding, however I 
&gt; have checked the json by saving it to a file and it does not contain the data 
&gt; shown inside the 'struct' in the exception. The only explanation I can come 
&gt; up with is that the badmatch is occurring within riakc\\_pb socket and was 
&gt; triggered by my call to riakc\\_pb\\_socket:search/6, and the process link is 
&gt; somehow influencing the crash report.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Is there a newer version of riak-erlang-client that might fix the issue? I 
&gt; noticed that though labeled v1.2, it came out in April; has there been a 
&gt; client code update for EE 1.2?
&gt; 2. Would it help make my code more robust if I tried to filter out these 
&gt; not\\_found's so it wouldn't reach the client? As in
