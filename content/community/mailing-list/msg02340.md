Thanks.

I like Riak's flexibility. Just throw another server into the mix and
Riak adjusts accordingly. With memcached I'd have to change code or
configuration and restart to see the new machine. I could locate a
small Riak database on servers that need permissions/preferences/etc.
I don't think I need sessions. I guess I could memcached Riak on each
machine for reads! Haha, that kind of stuff just makes me chuckle...
:)

Thanks
Mike

&gt;&gt; define which servers you want to use for storage. Ideally I don't
&gt;&gt; care. I want my core/auth server to write preferences and permissions
&gt;&gt; to the cache and let tornado on other servers pull those keys out. I
&gt;&gt; think Riak could perform this in theory, but is Riak fast enough?
