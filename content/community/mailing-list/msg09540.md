I am guessing from the comments that this port should be the same for all
machines in the cluster?

 %% riak\\_handoff\\_port is the TCP port that Riak uses for
 %% intra-cluster data handoff.
 {handoff\\_port, 8099 },

OK, perhaps you're using the same port for different functions in Riak?

In particular, I see you're using 8099 for your http port but in my setup
8099 is used for "handoff\\_port".

Here's the ports I'm using:

pb\\_port, 8087
http, 8098
handoff\\_port, 8099

Make sure all three (four if you're also using "https") are on different
ports.
