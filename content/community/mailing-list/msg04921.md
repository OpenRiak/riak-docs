&gt; unfortunately our demand for capacity is increasing faster than anticipated,

&gt; human resources for developing a good fuse bindings ourselves.
&gt;
&gt; of course, if we don't find anything, we can simply scale out our
&gt; active/passive architecture we're running at the moment, but this gets more
&gt; and more complicated, the more servers we throw in.
&gt;
&gt; that's why i'm looking for some beautiful and simple design that minimizes
&gt; the possibility of administrative failures.

Probably very off-topic here but we all have to deal with hardware at
some level and this is an interesting brute-force approach to
capacity:

I believe they only provide an http layer for access, not file system
emulation though, and the software isn't open source.
