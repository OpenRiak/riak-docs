Given the amount of time I've spent trying to deal with the
eccentricities of file locking in windows, I suggest caution as there
lies dragons.

Obviously it's \\*possible\\*, and I'm guessing Windows developers with
file-system experience probably laugh at my caution, but for anything
involving lots of file handles when you're used to \\*nix, be aware that
it's non-trivial. Although I guess this would only really affect
bitcask.

Although after googling about this issue, the wikipedia page would
have been immensely helpful to me:

But don't let me discourage anybody wanting to give it a go ;-)
