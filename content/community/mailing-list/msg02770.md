Hi riak-users,

I'm trying out the java protocol buffers client, and it works fine.
 However, it is preventing my process from exiting. When I used the http
client from the same spot in code, the process exited, but switching to PBC
caused it to hang on exit. Usually this behavior means there is a thread
being spawned that is still running in the background. I wonder if there's
a way to tell the PBC RiakClient that I'm done with it, and it can close? I
don't see anything like that in the available methods.
