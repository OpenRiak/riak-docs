You should only issue the join command once - when you create the cluster. 
After that happens, the nodes will join the cluster at start.

&gt; Thank you. This is very helpful. Two more questions. One, my dev[1234] has
&gt; about 6Mb of data in the directory. What are the bare minimum required files
&gt; and directories? Two, would I issue the 'join' command here also to form the
&gt; cluster?

&gt; 
&gt; If you edit /etc/init.d/riak you should see a line like:
&gt; 
&gt; su - riak -c "$DAEMON $DAEMON\\_ARGS" || return 2
&gt; 
&gt; in the "do\\_start" function.
&gt; 
&gt; If you change that line into the following 4 lines:
&gt; 
&gt; su - riak -c "/path/to/your/riak/dev1/bin/riak $DAEMON\\_ARGS" ||
&gt; return 2
&gt; su - riak -c "/path/to/your/riak/dev2/bin/riak $DAEMON\\_ARGS" ||
&gt; return 2
&gt; su - riak -c "/path/to/your/riak/dev3/bin/riak $DAEMON\\_ARGS" ||
&gt; return 2
&gt; su - riak -c "/path/to/your/riak/dev4/bin/riak $DAEMON\\_ARGS" ||
&gt; return 2
&gt; 
&gt; it should start all your Riak nodes on boot.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the link for the tutorial. I am still not sure what the 
&gt;&gt; sequence should be for calling your script on startup. All of the 
&gt;&gt; examples that I have seen startup a single executable. It looks like I 
&gt;&gt; need to either include your script into another script and start it or .
&gt;&gt; . . .
