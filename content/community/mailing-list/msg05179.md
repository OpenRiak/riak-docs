Nope. Not available within Riak. You need to front Riak by something 
like nginx or haproxy.

Hi folks,

Is it possible to perform some network-level access control in riak?
For example, clients within a network prefix can only access a
specific set of buckets?

How is riak usually set up in a multi-tenant environment?

Thanks.
