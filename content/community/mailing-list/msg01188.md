Logging is enabled by default, it just isn't available from a console as 
before. You can find the logs in /var/log/riak/ if you're using a binary 
package or in your rel/riak/log directory if you built from source. The logs 
aren't quite as verbose as the console logging. Is there a problem you're 
trying to track down?
