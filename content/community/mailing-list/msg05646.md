&gt; &gt; I pushed to my Github a Lager backend for sending log messages to

&gt; &gt; https://github.com/jbrisbin/lager\\_amqp\\_backend
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It uses a re-connecting connection pool for sending messages, so it's
&gt; pretty fast and will automatically recover if RabbitMQ goes down (but it
&gt; does \\*not\\*, at the moment, internally queue log messages if it can't
&gt; connect to the broker).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The idea is to aggregate logging from riak\\_core applications, but you
&gt; should be able to use it in Riak/DB as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Many thanks, it looks good. I've added a link to it from lager's README.
