I would like to understand better why '/etc/init.d/riak stop' stops riak, but 
the 'epmd' daemon continues to run. I would have hoped that when I 
administratively stop riak on a node that all its various cogs would stop 
turning. 

Furthermore, I'm not clear on how the lifecycle of epmd is controled. Is it 
started by any Erlang process that runs, and never stopped?

I would appreciate any insights folks could offer. Thanks!

Dave
