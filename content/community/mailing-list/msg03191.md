Hello riak users! 

I have a 4 node cluster that started out as 3 nodes. ring\\_creation\\_size = 2048, 
target\\_n\\_val is default (4), and all buckets have n\\_val = 3.

When I joined the 4th node, for a few minutes some GETs were returning 'not 
found' for data that was already in riak. Eventually the data was returned, due 
to read repair I would assume. Is this expected? It seems that 'not found' and 
read repairs should only happen when something goes wrong, like a node goes 
down. Not when adding a node to the cluster, which is supposed to be part of 
normal operation!

Any help or insight is appreciated!

Greg
