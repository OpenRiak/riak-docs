&gt; 
&gt; Thanks alot... this seems to be the problem. When i navigate to JSON files
&gt; under 127.0.0.1 i get prompted to download. 
&gt; 
&gt; How did you fix this?

It depends on your browser you are using. By default Firefox will attempt to 
download JSON encoded data to a file while Safari and Chrome will just display 
it in the browser.
