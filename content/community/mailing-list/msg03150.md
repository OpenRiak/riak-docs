If you're working in a Rails project, the 'ripple' generator will generate a 
stub for you (works with rspec, test/unit and cucumber). If not, feel free to 
crib from the spec\\_helper.rb in any of the Ripple sub-projects.

&gt; Hello,

&gt; I'm starting out using Riak with Ripple, and I was wondering how I might go 
&gt; about performing functional tests using the Ripple test server. Does anyone 
&gt; have any tips for this???
