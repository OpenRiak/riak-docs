Riak Recap for May 13 - 15
====================

1) We added Swipely to the list of production deployments on the Riak Wiki.

\\* Check it out here ---&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/Who-is-Using-Riak.html#swipely

Anyone else out there in production and want to tell the community
about your Riak usage? Get in touch with me to claim your production T
Shirt...

2) Last reminder about the Riak Meetup happening in NYC on Wednesday.
The agenda has been updated to reflect the awesome talk that Basho CTO
Justin Sheehy will be delivering.

\\* Details here ---&gt; http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Riak-Meetup/events/17293915/

(Also, if you make it to this meetup, be sure to say thanks to Paul
Fisher and Brent Hargrave for organizing.)

3) For anyone heading to RailsConf, Basho Developer Advocate Adam
Hunter (@adamachine) will be at Bohconf, the official Unconf of
RailsConf. Shoot him a message on Twitter if you're in the area and
want to meet up and talk Riak and Rails.

4) Scott M. Likens updated the the EngineYard AppCloud recipe for Riak Search.

\\* Details here ---&gt; https://twitter.com/#!/scottmlikens/status/69891396445806592

Thanks, Scott!

5) For anyone following the state of Erlang support in VMWare's Cloud
Foundry project, there is some good news: support for deploying
Erlang/OTP applications is now available (thanks to the magic of
Rebar, btw).

\\* Here's all the details ---&gt;
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap/blob/master/docs/erlang-otp.md

6) The video of OJ Reeves' Riak presenation from last week's Brisbane
alt.net meetup is now available.

\\* Watch here ---&gt; http://hackingon.net/post/riak-altnet.aspx

(h/t to @liammclennan for recording, editing, and publishing this!)

7) Last reminder for tomorrow night's "Getting Started with Riak" talk
happening at the Arlington/DC Erlang User Group.

\\* Details here ---&gt; http://www.meetup.com/erlang/events/17550721/

8) Q --- Hi, what is the default read quorum in java api? Can't find
it anywhere. (from TB123 via #riak)

 A --- The default is actually called "Quorum", which is calculated
based on your n\\_val. With the default n\\_val of 3, Quorum is going to
be 2 on a read. The code that handles this is here ---&gt;
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/blob/master/src/riak\\_kv\\_util.erl#L143

9) Max Beutel contributed a small fix to the PHP Client.

\\* Details here ---&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-php-client/pull/13

Thanks, Max!
