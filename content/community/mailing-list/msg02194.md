Bruce,

If you have the time, sanitize the code you wrote to load the data and send a 
pull request to the Riak Function Contrib. We'd love to have another example!

https://github.com/basho/riak\\_function\\_contrib
http://contrib.basho.com/

We'd also love to put a link to the sample data on the wiki:

https://github.com/basho/riak\\_wiki
http://wiki.basho.com/Sample-Data.html

If you don't have time to do either of those, send me an email privately and 
we'll take care of it next week.

&gt; I was searching for a large data set that I could use to test Riak and I

&gt; 
&gt; You can download it here:
&gt; 
&gt; http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Wiktionary contains about 2.3 million entries and it's easy to parse the 
&gt; data. I just pulled out the word's title and definition. If any one wants a 
&gt; little Java program that I wrote to parse the data and add it to Riak send me 
&gt; a private email.
