Do you gave a .erlang file in your home directory?

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; This one has probably been answered many times before and I apologize
&gt; in advance...
&gt; 
&gt; I have built and installed my first riak instance and along the way
&gt; discovered two things:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Build with Erlang version &lt;= R14B01
&gt; 2. This one is a bit different ....
&gt; 
&gt; Execution Environment
&gt; ====================
&gt; OS = Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
&gt; ERL = Erlang R14B01 (erts-5.8.2) [source] [smp:4:4] [rq:4]
&gt; [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]
&gt; Riak = riak-0.14.0
&gt; 
&gt; The Problem
&gt; ===========
&gt; I cant execute raik-admin commands because
&gt; 
&gt; ~/build/riak-0.14.0/rel/riak/erts-5.8.2/bin/escript
&gt; ~/build/riak-0.14.0/rel/riak/erts-5.8.2/bin/nodetool -name
&gt; riak@127.0.0.1 -setcookie riak ping
&gt; 
&gt; is returning ...
&gt; 
&gt; "Running Erlang
&gt; pong"
&gt; 
&gt; and as a result the "$RES" != "pong" is returning positive ie "Node is
&gt; not running!" ...
&gt; 
&gt; if [ "$RES" != "pong" ]; then
&gt; echo "Node is not running!"
&gt; exit 1
&gt; fi
&gt; 
&gt; ... and it is running.
&gt; 
&gt; Has this been observed before? Was there a solution that I can use?
&gt; How do we suppress the "Running Erlang ~n"?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew
