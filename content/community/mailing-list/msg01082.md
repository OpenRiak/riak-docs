Scott,

There is no limit on the number of buckets unless you are changing the bucket 
properties, like the replication factor, allow\\_mult, or the pre- and 
post-commit hooks. Buckets that have properties other than the defaults 
consume space in the ring state. Other than that, they are essentially free 
unless you're using a backend that segregates data by bucket - the only one 
that does at this time is innostore.

Is there a reason you need so many buckets?
