Hi

An error has been detected in riak, the error is:

reached\\_max\\_restart\\_intensity

the problem I think is the ulimit in the system used by riak because when I
try make a put to riak with a large content the node is disconnected from my 
application, but I am not sure of that

I use protbuffs to access riak, using a simple load balancing to my cluster.

Is it the problem?
How can I configure the ulimit for riak, if it is the problem?

Thanks

Jorge Garrido
