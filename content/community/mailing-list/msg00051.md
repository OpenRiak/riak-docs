Hi,

I am trying to figure what the fastest way would be to send a
mapreduce result set for indexing into a searchengine system like
elasticsearch.

Of course, the trivial way to do it would be to simply gather the
result set and push it back into the indexer using their http/rest
api.

Now, elasticsearch is distributed by nature and will allow parallel
queries for document insertion for indexing. One way to leverage this
would be to actually directly push a document from within a map
function into the indexer using their rest api. This would completely
distribute the index creation process and leverage the parallelism of
elasticsearch.

Would this be possible?

Is this something I could do using the JavaScript mapreduce? and/or Erlang?

Thanks,
Colin
