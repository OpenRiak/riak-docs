- does node communication is plain erlang node interprocesses
 communication as described in
 http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference\\_manual/distributed.html#id2280311 ?
 So what is the correct way to allow nodes to join the ring, and how
 to encrypt data transfert ? Do you consider that Riak should stay
 away from that, and for example, rely on a VPN ?

Riak nodes belonging to the same cluster do use distributed Erlang to 
communicate. We
 have no plans to encrypt this data as it would likely impact overall 
performance. If
 you really need to encrypt cluster traffic then a VPN would be appropriate.


That makes sens.


Could you describe your use case for encrypting cluster traffic?


End-to-end authentication and encryption, without ability to trust network.

- do you plan to provide some kind of access control, at the
 bucket-level for example, with credentials or anything else ? Or do
 you consider that Riak should stay away from that, and rely on a http
 reverse proxy doing authentication and access control ?

We do not have any immediate plans to add security or authorization. Deploying 
reverse
proxies for security is a very common pattern.


Again that makes sens. I also favor separation of concerns, and I wanted to 
make sure that
was the recommanded way to go.

thank you for this quick shed of light
