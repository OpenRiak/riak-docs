Couldn't find much on this out in the wild, so I'm assuming I'm not looking for 
the right things.

I'm trying to figure out Riak's MapReduce using the Ruby client. I can't seem 
to get even the simplest map/reduce to work:

function(v){ var o = JSON.parse(v.values[0].data); return [o]; }

So I thought I'd log what I was doing inside this function. I could not, for 
the life of me, find a reference for the available Javascript functions, 
objects, etc... that are available so I can do some debugging.

What tools are available to me within a map/reduce function? There seems to be 
some conflicting information, particularly regarding a "Riak" object that I've 
seen referenced online. Couldn't find any docs on it, though.

Thanks ahead of time!
