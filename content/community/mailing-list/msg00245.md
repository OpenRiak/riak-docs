Scenario: I need to upgrade the OS of my nodes in my cluster which
will result in a reboot of each node. What would be the process to
nicely migrate data away from each node?

If my understanding is correct, performing a nice shutdown of a riak
node via `riak stop` will migrate the data away from the node. Am I
correct? If so, approximately how long would it take to do the
migration if say each node represents 1 gig of data? Does that whole
gig get migrated away or only the data that is not replicated?
