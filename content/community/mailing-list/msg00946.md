Hey Riak Rubyists,

I've been delaying releasing riak-client/ripple version 0.8 because of a few 
features that are not complete yet. However, it's also been over two months 
since 0.7.1 was released, so I thought I'd release some beta gems this morning. 
 Here's the major fixes and features in this beta release, in no particular 
order:

\\* Keys are not listed by default on buckets.
\\* New bucket properties (quorum defaults) are supported
\\* Fixed some bucket/key escaping issues
\\* Linked associations on Ripple::Document classes
\\* Easier to load RObjects emitted by MapReduce jobs
\\* Fixed some load-order issues
\\* Added Rails model generators
\\* Improved #inspect output for several classes
\\* Documents can set their desired persistence/quorum values
\\* Ripple is pegged to Rails 3 RC2

The missing/pending/WIP features are:

\\* Rails and Rack session stores (as a new gem, riak-sessions)
\\* RFuzz-based HTTP backend (supports request headers split to 8KB max)

You can get the beta gems by specifying "0.8.0.beta" with bundler or install 
them with "gem install ripple --pre".

This release has had the most community contributions yet. Keep them coming!
