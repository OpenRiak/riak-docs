Next week we'll be deploying a beta commercial app that uses Riak. We're making 
some choices regarding cloud providers and I wanted to get some feedback and 
observations from the community regarding use of Riak on virtualized clusters 
in general. Info specific to providers might be best to send off list as all 
providers seem to be improving their offerings month by month and no need for 
today's commentary to linger on list archives for years to come.

Thanks in advance,

Jonah
