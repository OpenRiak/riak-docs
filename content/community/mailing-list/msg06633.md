Couple of questions on installation:

1. When using the pre-built .deb package I hit an error with dpkg requiring 
libssl version 0.9.8. I try to maintain the latest which is 1.1.0. While 
installing 0.9.8 fixed the immediate error is there a problem having multiple 
versions installed? And why is 0.9.8 required/hard-coded? Shouldn't any libssl 
be good enough? If I used -f would that cause other problems? 

2. I don't see ring\\_creation\\_size in the app.config file as per docs 
(http://wiki.basho.com/Configuration-Files.html). Is there a reason it's 
missing? How is it implemented? under which option? what format? 

3. If I've already started a new cluster, having added no data, but want to 
change the ring\\_creation\\_size, what are the steps? 

Thanks,

Tim
