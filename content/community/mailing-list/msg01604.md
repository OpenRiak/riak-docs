Hello,

Does anyone have innostore set up under multi\\_backend? I can't seem to get
it to work properly with multi\\_backend.

I tried adding it under the multi\\_backend, but it won't use any parameters
passed in in the third parameter. If I set it up as an application, you
can't select it as a backend. If I use both, I get an error with the erlang
open\\_port command (guess it's trying to spawn it twice if I have it under
multi\\_backend and configured as an app).

Is the solution here to modify the innostore.app file to give me the
defaults I want, build it then install innostore (if I set it up only under
multi\\_backend, it will work, but with the default app settings)?

If I've just completely missed the mark, don't be afraid to mock me :).
