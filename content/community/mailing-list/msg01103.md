Hi,

I was wondering if there is a practical limit to the number of links between 
objects - for example, if a User object has a 'friend' link to many other User 
objects. Are these links indexed somehow within Riak to speed up any queries on 
these relationships? 

Also, are there any good links to best practice data modelling in Riak? I'm 
completely new to document databases, however, can see that Riak (in 
combination with Lucene) might really suit a project I'm starting, but I'm a 
little uncertain how best to model various objects, especially as I still think 
in SQL/tables. Is there anything that might outline some newbie pitfalls - 
apart from the Basho docs.

I'd also like to know, what data wouldn't you store in Riak atm? I guess, I'm 
wondering what guarantees you get that data is written successfully (i.e. 
transactions), and how mature is the project in regards to production 
installations that trust it with critical data. Has anyone stored critical data 
such as billing data in Riak successfully, or would MySQL/Postgres still be a 
safer bet here? Although I do like the idea of managing fewer systems.

Soooo many questions....

Cheers,

Mark
