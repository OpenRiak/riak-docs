Vijayakumar,

You must be using the standard analyzer [1] for "Field 1" which will split
on '\\_' and drop '1'. You'll either want to use the whitespace analyzer or
noop analyzer in this scenario.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; RiakSearch is treating the queryterm as "\\*" when queryterm is of the
&gt; form "\\_" (eg:name\\_1,name\\_1) and returns the
&gt; entire record set. Is this a known issue?
&gt;
&gt; Example:
&gt;
&gt; Key Field1 Field2
&gt; key1 field\\_a sometext
&gt; key2 field\\_c sometext.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; When queried for Field1 with queryterm as "field\\_a" solr search returns
&gt; both key1 and key2 instead of key1 alone.
