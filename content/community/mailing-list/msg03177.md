Hi OJ,

&gt; Hi Russell,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the response. Pardon my tardiness in responding, I've had lots of 
&gt; fun at home with sick kids of late.

I heard, thinking of you and your family. Fingers crossed for a speedy recovery.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So my question: Is this how link walking should work when using the PBC? Or 
&gt;&gt; is there some way of getting the PBC to return the content at the same time 
&gt;&gt; as doing the link walking?
&gt; 
&gt; I asked yesterday and the answer I received was: no.
&gt; 
&gt; Cool, so I'm not barking mad then! Excellent :) Did you get any feedback as 
&gt; to whether or not there would be future work done to enable this?

Heh, I didn't ask. I've now opened a ticket 
(https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=1089) in reference to this.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Currently I link walk and do each step manually and I was wondering if there 
&gt;&gt; was a better or more optimal way of performing these actions.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment the plan is running an initial m/r job for the link phases then 
&gt; making a second m/r job with all the intermediate results as inputs. So 
&gt; maximum 2 jobs is my target.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Off the top of my head with the current implementation I can't see how you 
&gt; would do this any better. In fact, for link walks where the levels &gt; 2 this 
&gt; is really the only option (IMHO). For 2 levels or less you can easily fetch 
&gt; based on ID and you end up with the data faster with the same number of calls.
&gt; 
&gt; I will think about it a bit more and see what I can come up with (as soon as 
&gt; this sickness clears!).

I implemented link walking via m/r on the PB Java client last week and it was 
pretty simple. 2 m/r queries: 

 1. run link phases to gather inputs
 2. reduce to de-dupe and map to get values

I added a key arg so that the "link step" number was attached to the returned 
objects so that I could recreate a REST link walk style result.

&gt; 
&gt; How do you satisfy your requirement with the REST link walker? Specifically 
&gt; how do you get the value of \\*a\\* returned as part of the result?
&gt; 
&gt; With the REST link walker I'm not able to do this, so I have to make another 
&gt; call to get to this info. It'd be nice if the link walking mechanism also had 
&gt; a flag that said "please give me the link source value too". I realise that 
&gt; might be pie in the sky though :)

http://issues.basho.com, there is no harm in asking ;)

&gt; 
&gt; Cheers mate, thanks for the response.
