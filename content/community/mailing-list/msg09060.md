FYI the documentation for Riak recommends a 5 node cluster, minimum, for 
production environments for the best utilization of the redundancy and also, I 
believe, load balancing across the cluster.

&gt; 
&gt; RIAK does not make sense to compare with elevelDB, objective was to assess
&gt; the cost of organizing the cluster.
&gt; I was surprised by the difference in performance. I expected to order 20 000
&gt; put / sec. Perhaps, RIAK configured incorrect?
&gt; With these results, you need at least 4 servers with RIAK to replace one
&gt; server elevelDB. RIAK positioned as a high-performance cluster, I think it
&gt; is contrary to the speed of one node = 6636 put/sec with a record size of 55
&gt; bytes.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; This is not idle curiosity, I hoped to use it in one of my projects. But the
&gt; cost of the required number of servers will be too big.
