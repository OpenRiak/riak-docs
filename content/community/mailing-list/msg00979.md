Riak Recap for 8/27 - 8/29

1) benblack, hiredman and seancribbs had a long conversation in #riak
that started with bucket usage and expanded into vector clocks and
conflict resolution.

2) John Pavley, VP of Engineering at Limewire, wrote a great piece for
technewsworld.com called, "Hybrid Apps: The Art of Being in Two Places
at Once." Riak was mentioned as one of the web technologies they are
using.
