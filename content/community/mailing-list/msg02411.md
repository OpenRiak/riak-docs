Joe,

Use --data-binary instead of --data.

&gt; I'm experimenting with using riak/luwak as a store for many small

&gt; exploring Luwak. I'm seeing some strange behaviour though and I
&gt; wonder what I'm doing wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm using this command:
&gt; 
&gt; curl -i -X PUT -T g005.PNG\\_L -H "Content-Type: image/png"
&gt; http://sfdev02:8098/luwak/g005.PNG\\_L
&gt; 
&gt; It appears to work fine. But when I fetch the image I get something
&gt; back a little larger. (2513986 bytes, originally 2513954 bytes)
&gt; 
&gt; Also when I attempt to view the image in the browser, only about half
&gt; of it renders. I wonder if my CURL statement is encoding something
&gt; wrong?
