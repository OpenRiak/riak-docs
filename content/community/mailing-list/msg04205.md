Appreciate the responses.

Since posting I've tried running up to 8 vnodes on this same physical
machine. Even with 8 the machine is under virtually no load when I have as
many loaders as possible running so it could be this sort of hardware isn't
a good candidate for a riak node.

Adding more vnodes does allow me to fire up more loaders, but as soon as I
cross the 4-5 loader mark on any specific node it stops responding for a few
seconds. I think I got it up to about 1600 inserts/sec at peak with 8 nodes
and a couple dozen loaders running.

It could also be that I am just trying to fit a workload on Riak that isn't
suitable. On this same machine with a single untuned Cassandra node I can
get about 15,000 inserts/sec using the exact same input data and when that
thing runs I can see the disks getting pounded and the CPU spiking. 
Cassandra lacks a map reduce interface though so it isn't as appealing. I
may stick with a multiple datastore approach on this particular project.
