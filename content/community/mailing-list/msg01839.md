Most of my day-to-day programming involves using a Weblogic application
server. Weblogic (like many app servers) supports the J2EE Connector
Architecture (JCA) specification as a way to develop a plugin to a
particular external system like a database. This would allow the
application server to manage connections to Riak and make it more efficient
for programs running within the app server. That's the theory anyway...

I am experimenting with JCA in general and considered building a JCA wrapper
for Riak. I searched the message logs and other resources and it doesn't
look like anyone else is doing this.

Is there anyone else that might be interested in testing this when I'm
done? if it works, I will contribute it.
