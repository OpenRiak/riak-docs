Morning Ryan,

Hey thanks for the info. I'm testing with 1.0 right now (great job with that 
by the way) and I hope to be able to switch our deployment package over to 1.0 
soon.

As always I appreciate your time and trouble.

&gt; It's worth pointing out that in 1.0 this should be greatly improved because 
&gt; now we have changed vclock behavior in relation to PUTs [1]. Essentially, 
&gt; client id now comes from the vnode, not externally, which leads to 
&gt; smaller/static vclock sizes even in the face of frequent updates.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't say with complete certainty that reducing the small/big vclock won't 
&gt; change your perf characteristics but I will say it is probably better to have 
&gt; smaller vclocks which in turn leads to smaller objects. Since pruning will 
&gt; happen more often I would imagine your PUT latencies could potentially go up 
&gt; a little. The best way to know is to measure.
&gt; 
&gt; Another option is setting last\\_write\\_wins to true but this should only be 
&gt; used as a last effort and only if you truly don't care about siblings [2].

&gt; Morning All,

&gt; I have noticed that with the default vclock settings the size of the 
&gt; X-Riak-Vclock header gets really big really fast for certain objects that are 
&gt; updated frequently. I am considering setting small\\_vclock to 4 and 
&gt; big\\_vclock to 16 instead of the default values of 10 and 50, respectivly.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that that are various performance optimizations that are based upon 
&gt; certain default bucket settings and was wondering if this change would 
&gt; adversely affect any of those.
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks!
