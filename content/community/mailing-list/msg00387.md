Sorry, I was wrong. Since app.conf was reset, Riak was using kv
storage again. When I switched back to Innostore, I got the same
problem again.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Greetings.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm running Mac OS X 10.5.8. Riak 0.10.1 is compiled and works good.
&gt;&gt;&gt; However, when I install Innostore like described at the wiki page and
&gt;&gt;&gt; try to perform any operations with Riak, node goes down.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; When I start riak using `bin/riak console`, everything seems to work good:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 100516 12:48:13 Embedded InnoDB 1.0.6.6750 started; log sequence number 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 44243
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; But when I try to get keys from a bucket, to put any data using basic
&gt;&gt;&gt; Erlang interface (either from the other Erlang node or from the opened
&gt;&gt;&gt; console), Riak crashes with bus error.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I tried to start Riak as root but with the same result. Then thought
&gt;&gt;&gt; that perhaps free disk space is too low (about 12 GB) and freed some
&gt;&gt;&gt; space (up to about 20 GB) but still get the same result. Also, tried
&gt;&gt;&gt; to turn SMP on and off - still no result.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm going to try installing it on my FreeBSD machine, will write about
&gt;&gt;&gt; the results.
