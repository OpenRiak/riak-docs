Riak Recap for 5/3

1) Q --- When defining javascript map/reduce jobs as a document in
Riak is the performance as good as using a built-in JS function? (from
drev)

 A --- Not currently. We have to do a check to determine if the
function has been defined before calling it and that takes some time.
There are some plans to spend some time speeding up this process but
other features are taking precedent at the moment.
