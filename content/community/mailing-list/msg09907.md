Evening, Morning, Afternoon to All -

Sorry for the delay in Recaps. It has been a hectic few weeks.

We've got all sorts of goodness in here. Enjoy, and thanks for being a
part of Riak. Also, just a heads up, but clear your calendar for the
2nd week of May, especially if you're on the East Coast of the US (or
plan to be)...

Lastly, I'll be San Diego tomorrow night (for this -&gt;
http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5174472988/) and LA the day after for
a few hours. If anyone wants to chat Riak, let me know and I'll try to
make some time.
