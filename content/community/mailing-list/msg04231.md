Switching to the riak\\_kv\\_index\\_backend backend worked like a charm.
 Interestingly the objects that were there from bitcask still exist and work
fine.

This is a pretty amazing feature. Will probably result in some pretty
awesome press for you guys.

Can you (or are there plans to) return the objects instead of just the keys?
 Can you use a filter with a map() function?

Any target date for the "beta for the adventurous"? :)
