Hey there! 

Just thought I'd let you guys know that I just released a new version of the 
Riak Handbook, a free update if you already bought it. It comes with more than 
40 pages of new content, focussing primarily on use cases and usage scenarios 
(data modelling, access patterns, pros and cons), operations (lots of details 
on monitoring, load-balancing and network placement of nodes), pre- and 
post-commit, plus a whole slew of little additions and fixes. Also, the book 
now comes as a man page for easy reading on the command line.

You can read all about what's in the release here:

To celebrate, the book is 25% off through next Monday: http://riakhandbook.com/

Cheers, Mathias
