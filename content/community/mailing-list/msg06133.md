Ouch. 

I'm shocked that is not considered a major bug. At minimum that kind of stuff 
should be front and center in their wiki/docs. Here I am thinking n 2 on a 3 
node cluster means I'm covered when in fact I am not. It's the whole reason I 
gave Riak consideration.

As Alexander pointed out, N does not mean "a separate PC". There was a
thread about this earlier:
