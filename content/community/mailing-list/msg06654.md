I was hoping someone could clue me in on exactly what the mem\\_allocated stat
is measuring.

I'm running a 6 node cluster, 4gb of ram per node. We've got about 12M keys,
but this will be growing substantially in the near future. The cluster looks
relatively good in terms of memory use, with about 3 quarters being
allocated to disk cache. 

Currently, mem\\_allocated per node == total mem per node, so I'm wondering if
this measure is a good indication of needing to add nodes, or if not, what
it's actually measuring.
