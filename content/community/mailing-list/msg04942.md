Jeremiah, really nice job on CorrugatedIron! Some of it is a bit too
over-engineered and more complicated than it has to be. For example,
you can't just create a RiakClient object and interact with Riak (like
you can do with the official Riak client libraries)... To create a
RiakClient (in CorrugatedIron) you need to have a RiakCluster object
to pass to the RiakClient object constructor. And you can't easily
create a RiakCluster object either. You can only create it from a
config section (there's no way to explicitly provide the config values
directly in the API). Not every app uses .NET app config files and
it's also not uncommon for the app config code to cause exceptions
because it can be brittle...
