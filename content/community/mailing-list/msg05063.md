Riak Recap for October 3 - 4
=====================

1) Basho Developer Advocate Greg Burd wrote a lengthy and content-rich
piece on NoSQL for USENIX.

2) The crew over at Canvas Hosting wrote a great overview piece about Riak.

3) We announced a Riak Meetup in Mountain View happening on November
1st. Will Moss and the Bump Team will be giving an overview of how
they use Riak and also share some details on a custom Haskell object
proxy they've written.

\\* Details and registration here ---&gt;

4) I noticed that Greg Pascale and the crew at Clipboard successfully
performed a rolling upgrade to 1.0 running LevelDB from Bitcask.
(http://twitter.com/#!/gregpascale/statuses/121690312925122560) I was
wondering if anyone else had details (good or bad) on upgrades they've
done to 1.0 or from Bitcask to LevelDB. Any and all info is valuable.
(Feel free to email me off list if you prefer.)
