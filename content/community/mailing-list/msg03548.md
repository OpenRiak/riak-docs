&gt; Aphyr & Andrew -
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your responses. I'm trying to wrap my head around the issues you 
&gt; raised, and I must confess it's difficult. Anyway, some questions for you...

&gt; &gt;&gt; Riak can't use the vclock for conflict resolution on a fresh object,
&gt; &gt;&gt; i.e. one without a vclock. Deletes are writes. You should use get or
&gt; &gt;&gt; reload before writing to help Riak sequence your writes correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; If the caller doesn't have a handle to the RObject in the Ruby framework, or 
&gt; the metadata of an HTTP response, but is only accessing the data by bucket 
&gt; and key values, is there any way to use reload? And if the object has been 
&gt; deleted is there any way to use get?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; On top of this, Riak has some weirdness around very quick sequences
&gt; &gt;&gt; of deletes/writes due, IIRC, to deletes not being tagged with a
&gt; &gt;&gt; vector clock. I... think... this will be addressed in an upcoming
&gt; &gt;&gt; release.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried inserting a 20 second pause between each read/write, but there was no 
&gt; change in the behavior. Should it be longer than that?

This is scary, it should not be possible to trigger this behaviour with
such a large gap. Even 10ms was enough to prevent it in my testing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ah, my favorite bug. This is indeed mostly solved on master by exposing
&gt; &gt; the vclocks for tombstones so they can be cleanly overwritten by the new
&gt; &gt; object rather than merged into a frankenobject that has the metadata of
&gt; &gt; the tombstone but the value of the new object (which is then subject to
&gt; &gt; real deletion).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So the fix for the issue was to add a new type of return value for a get
&gt; &gt; that finds a tombstone, {error, {deleted, Vclock}} instead of always
&gt; &gt; returning {error, notfound} on a true notfound or when a tombstone is
&gt; &gt; encountered.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That sounds like exactly what I need. Can I simulate that fix in my Ruby 
&gt; code? Any pointers about that? Any chance we could get that into the Ruby 
&gt; client? I'd be willing to put a little effort into that, but I don't really 
&gt; understand the issues well enough yet.

I suspect we will want to update the clients to support this, but I
don't know of a specific plan to do so yet. I don't know the details of
the ruby client enough (or at all) to advise on making changes to it.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; An example of how to safely delete for all 3 APIs can be found at
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; https://gist.github.com/965376
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Note the new deletedvclock option. The REST API will always use this
&gt; &gt; option on gets and will return a X-Riak-Vclock header along with any 404
&gt; &gt; that is actually a tombstone.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Some further reading can be found here:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=260
&gt; &gt; https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=555
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, long story short; either upgrade to master and use the deletedvclock
&gt; &gt; option or avoid doing rapid put/delete/put cycles.
&gt; 
&gt; You're suggesting I use mercurial to pull down the HEAD and use that, right?
&gt; 

git, not mercurial. I don't think we maintain the bitbucket repos
anymore, everything has moved to github.
