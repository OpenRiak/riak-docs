Riak Recap for January 20 - 25
=======================

1) We put out a press release a few days ago with details on how Auric
Systems is using Riak.

2) This is less technical than most items on the Recap but I wanted to
pass it along anyways: If you happen to be driving up the 101 in the
Bay Area over the next month, you might see Basho and Voxer on a
billboard. :)
