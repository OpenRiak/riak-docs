A project I am working on uses the 1.0.0.beta2 versions of Ripple and 
Riak-Sessions. I have those gems installed and the code works fine. 

A colleague installed my project today (via bundler) but could not find the 
gems on rubygems. Did these gem versions get deprecated? What are the latest 
versions?
