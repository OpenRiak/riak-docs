&gt; Ok, this is a little simpler but I'm not sure how to proceed. When I pull

Hi, Jim. Just %0A seems to work for me:

$ curl -X PUT -H "content-type: text/plain"
http://localhost:8098/riak/jim/one-two%0Athree --data "hello"

$ curl http://localhost:8098/riak/jim?keys=true
{…"keys":["one-two\\nthree"]}

$ curl http://localhost:8098/riak/jim/one-two%0Athree
hello

$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8098/riak/jim/one-two%0Athree
$ curl http://localhost:8098/riak/jim/one-two%0Athree
not found

That was on the tip of riak's master branch. If you're still having
trouble, could you please reply with the Riak version you're using (I
know that 0.14 had an odd encoding behavior that was fixed in 1.0[1]),
as well as your choice of client and a snippet or two of code?
