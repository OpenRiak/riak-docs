The good news: you did fetch it.

The bad news: immediately afterward Erlang's pattern matching failed
which threw an exception which killed the shell/CLI process that you
were using which closed the port that was associated with the Protocol
Buffers client which closed the TCP connection.

If you use {ok, C1} and {ok, C2} for steps #2 and #3, you'll probably
find the success you're looking for. As you'd used them, in step #2, C
was an unbound variable, so it became bound. In step #3, C was a bound
variable, and the term in tuple position 2 in on the righthand side
didn't match C.

The shells "help()." function mentions two variations of a helpful
gizmo, in case you don't like creating lots of unique variable names at
the shell: "f()." and "f(Variable)." to unbind all or a single variable,
respectively.
