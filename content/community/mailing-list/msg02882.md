Hi all,

I just wanted to back up Sean and Andrew. In the last two days I've
built Riak from source on Arch and Ubuntu (both 64bit) with R14B02 and
haven't had any issues at all.

Works on my machine ;-)

Jason,

Andrew did fix those issues, however homebrew uses release tarballs
rather than git to build. If you modify your local formula to pull
from git, it should work just fine.

&gt; It doesn't build out of the box if you use latest git? I thought I'd fixed
&gt; the R12B02 issues.
