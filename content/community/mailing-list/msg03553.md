&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a client which uses both the REST and PBC interfaces to Riak. When 
&gt; this client makes calls, I want to make sure that the same client ID is used 
&gt; for both of these interfaces. If I have an array of bytes which represents 
&gt; the PBC version of the client ID, is the REST version of this client ID (that 
&gt; goes into the X-Riak-ClientId header) just that same array of bytes base64 
&gt; encoded?

Yes.

&gt; If not, how do I correctly set the header so that the client IDs match?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
