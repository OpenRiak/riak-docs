Afaik, range queries the likes of which you suggest are not possible in riak 
because riak is an inherently unordered system. That being said, it is a major 
cause of concern for those looking at riak as a potential solution. One 
ultimately needs to implement a secondary ordered index elsewhere to achieve 
desired results. I pair riak with redis, like pairing a sizzling steak with a 
fine red wine.

&gt; I'm wondering if there's any way to achieve a limited secondary index

&gt; implement things like pagination, incremental joins over multiple
&gt; indices, etc. (For efficiency I guess it would have to be something
&gt; like "up to N records from each vnode"?)
&gt; 
&gt; Looking at the source code, I think the answer is no, but since range
&gt; queries are already implemented using iterators, it doesn't seem like
&gt; it would be too hard to add. Can anyone comment on the roadmap for a
&gt; feature like this, and/or the possibility of getting a patch accepted?
