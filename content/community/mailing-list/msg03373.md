Hi André,

You are correct; there is an issue with link walking when N=1. Bug #975 has
been filed to address this issue:
https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=975

Thanks,

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I've been experimenting with Riak and I've run into unexpected behavior
&gt; when using link-walk.
&gt; Basically link-walking stops working for a bucket that is set with
&gt; replication factor of 1. The replication factor
&gt; was always set before using the bucket (filling it with data), both on a
&gt; per-bucket basis and on a global basis
&gt; (on app.config) and the result is the same. I'm running Riak 0.14.1 on Mac
&gt; OS X and I'm using Ruby's client.
&gt; It's not a client problem though since the same problem exists when I issue
&gt; the link-walk directly through the
&gt; http interface (using curl).
&gt; It's possible that this behavior is expected but I couldn't find anything
&gt; on it, so spare me my ignorance ;-)
