Hi Koen,

I did some basho\\_benching against S3 once. I wrote a simple driver based on
erlcloud. Code is in following branch:
https://github.com/basho/basho\\_bench/tree/erlcloud

And an example config can be found at:
https://github.com/basho/basho\\_bench/blob/erlcloud/examples/s3.config

Hope that helps

&gt; Dear List,

&gt; Just wondering if there was already an s3 driver for basho\\_bench?
&gt; I found the LeoFS bansho\\_bench driver
&gt; https://github.com/leo-project/leofs/tree/master/test
&gt;
&gt; But if you try this one on a real S3 implementation (so not LeoFS),
&gt; it does not provide all needed headers
&gt; For example the date header is not included when you do a get/put request,
&gt; only
&gt;
&gt; {'Content-Type', ?S3\\_CONTENT\\_TYPE}, {'Authorization', gen\\_sig("PUT", Url)}
&gt;
&gt; Are used in this driver.
&gt;
&gt; I was just wondering if there exists already a kind of Amazon S3 driver
&gt; for basho\\_bench?
