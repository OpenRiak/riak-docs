&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt; I am trying to store 1543400 records using the memory backend.
&gt;&gt; I have a basic cluster setup with 2 nodes..
&gt;&gt; I am using the pbcClient
&gt;&gt; Bucket b = client.createBucket("test\\_bucket1").nVal(1).execute();
&gt;&gt; //store object
&gt;&gt; StoreObject storeObject =
&gt;&gt; buckt.store((String) key,buf);
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; storeObject.dw(Quora.ONE).returnBody(false).execute();
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The store takes forever..
&gt;&gt; I have riak installed on RHEL 6
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any suggestions?

&gt; Multi-threading. A single client thread is going to max out somewhere
&gt; in the neighborhood of 100 per second best case. (give or take,
&gt; depending on network, size of objects, etc).

Sorry for the double reply - you also do not want to be calling
`createBucket()` every time. This fetches/sends the bucket information
from/to Riak. You want to create the `Bucket` object once then pass it
around. If that's not possible due to how you have written your code,
use the `fetchBucket()` instead along with
`lazyLoadBucketProperties()` so as not to be querying the bucket
parameters each time.
