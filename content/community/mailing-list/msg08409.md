Hi List,

I'm trying to set the n-val to 1 for my single-node test server but do 
always fail with the following error:


Specified w/dw/pw values invalid for bucket n value of 1

This is my bucket configuration:

{"props":{"allow\\_mult":false,"basic\\_quorum":false,"big\\_vclock":50,"chash\\_keyfun":{"mod":"riak\\_core\\_util","fun":"chash\\_std\\_keyfun"},"dw":1,"last\\_write\\_wins":false,"linkfun":{"mod":"riak\\_kv\\_wm\\_link\\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\\_linkfun"},"n\\_val":1,"name":"messages","notfound\\_ok":true,"old\\_vclock":86400,"postcommit":[],"pr":1,"precommit":[],"pw":1,"r":1,"rw":1,"small\\_vclock":50,"w":1,"young\\_vclock":20}}

I can't see what's wrong with it, maybe someone can shed a light.

Regards,

 Ingo
