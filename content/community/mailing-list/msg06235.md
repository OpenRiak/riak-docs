I've logged an enhancement request for the ability to configure or
override the location of the temp folder to make it possible to run
multiple Riak instances as different users.

Provide a way to configure location of Riak temp folder:

&gt; Hi, Jeremy.
&gt;
&gt; Had a problem with this myself (while running few nodes on one machine for 
&gt; tests, was having problems with write permissions), actually its hardcoded in 
&gt; some module so - no.

&gt;&gt; Is there a way to change riak's temp folder location from /tmp/riak to 
&gt;&gt; something else? I didn't see an option for this in the app.config or 
&gt;&gt; elsewhere.
