I have a 3 node test server (actually 3 machines) to test the
behavior/size requirement of
the keys. I have n set to the default value 3.

I started blasting large amount of keys/data into the 3 nodes at the
same time. At some point, it was too
much and one of the nodes crashed with a out of memory error.

at this point, I riak stop the other 2 nodes that were still alive at
the same time.

I looked at memory and disk usage, then restarted all 3 of them.
It was then I noticed that some of the keys appears to be missing.

can this actually happen with riak? I'm checking through my data
upload logs right now,
but I figure I should ask to be on the safe side.
