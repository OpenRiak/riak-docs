Hi,

When deleting a key from a bucket I'm noticing that the object associated with 
the key is gone but the key itself is still sticking around. I loop though all 
of the keys in a bucket and then call delete on each one, the object for the 
key is then gone so if I try to get the object for that key I get a 404 as 
expected. But if I look at the bucket in the browser with the keys=true 
parameter, all of the keys are still there. Is this normal and if so how do I 
get rid of the keys?

Thanks
