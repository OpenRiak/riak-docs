Riak Recap For May 11 - 12
=====================

1) Q --- Riak have any form of user auth built in, or does it just
assume that if it's accessible, it's meant for you to use? (from
intel352 via #riak)

 A ---

2) Q --- Are there any examples available that show how a SQL-based
application could transition to Riak? I know Riak is schema-less, I'm
more interested in seeing how other people solve such a transition.

3) For anyone in or around the Dallas area: Basho Developer Advocate
Grant Schofield will be giving a Riak Talk at the Dallas Big Data
Meetup on June 9.

\\* Details here ---&gt; http://www.dfwbigdata.org/events/17758631/

4) Bob Ippolito (@etrepum) and long-time Riak users Mochi Media have
been doing some very cool stuff with Riak of late. Bob recently
released a chunk of code called "statebox\\_riak." This is a subset of
code from the initial "statebox" repo they released a few weeks back.

\\* statebox\\_riak ---&gt; https://github.com/mochi/statebox\\_riak
\\* statebox ---&gt; https://github.com/mochi/statebox

And, Bob published a blog post demonstrating just how useful statebox
can be when dealing with merging and conflict resolution.

\\* Read here ---&gt; http://labs.mochimedia.com/archive/2011/05/08/statebox/

Thanks, Bob!

5) OJ Reeves (@thecolonial) just posted the code for the demo app that
he built and used for deliver his presentation at a recent .NET meetup
in Australia.

\\* Code is here on GitHub ---&gt; https://github.com/OJ/selusuh

Thanks, OJ! (Also, for you Riak historians out there, I believe this
is the first Riak preso to be delivered by a community member in
Australia. Anyone care to prove me wrong?)

6) MÃ¥rten Gustafson (@martengustafson) gave a NoSQL overview
presentation at the Progressive.NET meetup in Stockholm on May 12.
Riak got a non-trivial mention.
