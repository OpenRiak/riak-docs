You can link walk without MapReduce - the RpbContent object returned by the 
ProtocolBuffers API should include the immediate level of links. Otherwise, 
many clients support using HTTP requests to perform link walks of arbitrary 
depths.

The bigger question is: what are you trying to accomplish?

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; We were just wondering what is the best possible way to model 1 â€“ N 
&gt; relationships in Riak. We know that there are links but the mapreduce is too 
&gt; slow. So, we moved towards using RiakSearch but it seems that modeling 
&gt; relationships and having lists in riak search KV object doesn't quiet do the 
&gt; job.
&gt; 
&gt; So, we were looking for some guidance on this front.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
