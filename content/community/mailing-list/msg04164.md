&gt; I'm setting up a brand-new staging server, with Riak 0.14.2.
&gt;
&gt; As I want to get all production data, I thought I could scp the data
&gt; directory into the new one (besides the ring dir).
&gt;

What I normally do in this case is 'riak-admin backup .. and
riak-admin restore from that file. works like a charm. and you can
selectively backup/restore a node, or a the whole cluster.
