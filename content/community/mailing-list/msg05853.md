Also make sure that your node names (-name in vm.args) do not include the
IP address, but use a hostname that is (hopefully) managed by the server
handing out IP addresses. If the node name includes the IP address, your
Riak node won't be reachable when the machine restarts (and it might not
even start up).

&gt; My Riak cluster is on a network that uses dynamic IPs, so each node gets a
&gt; different IP address at reboot. How do I indicate in app.config that I want
&gt; to bind to an interface (such as 'eth0') regardless of it's IP address
&gt; rather than to a specific IP address?
