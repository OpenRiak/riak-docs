 Check the security settings on your EC2 instances.  Those settings
 include which ports are open.

 Hi all

 I have installed the Riak induvidually in two EC 2 instances and
 it is working fine. But I cant use the join two instances using
 riak-admin

 which specifies the Not reachable error.

 Then I added the 
  
 {kernel, [
 {inet\\_dist\\_listen\\_min, 8000},
 {inet\\_dist\\_listen\\_max, 8088}
 
 ]}

I tried it after referring the forum mailing lists.

Then I tried to join the nodes but i popped up the same Not reachable node error. I am using erlang R1304 and riak 0.14 because the erlang R1404 was
not getting installed in the instance and showed the error like

Fatal error in wait\\_\\_(): Function not implemented (38)

Thanks 
Bala
