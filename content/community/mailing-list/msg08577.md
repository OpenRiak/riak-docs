Many moons ago (circa 0.14.0) when you did a curl -X DELETE to a riak
bucket with a post commit hook it would be invoked and you could use the
X-Riak-Deleted tag to process the file. I have just such a post commit
hook running on on a 0.14.0 build.

We recently looked at upgrading to 1.2, but discovered that our post commit
hooks were no longer being fired at all on DELETE, only POST and PUT.
 Looking through the offending bits of the code, it looks like the entire
hook invocation subsystem was rewritten since 0.14.0, but the documentation
wiki: http://wiki.basho.com/Commit-Hooks.html#Post-Commit-Hooks

Still states that:

As with pre-commit hooks, deletes are considered writes so post-commit hook
functions will need to inspect object metadata for the presence of \\*
X-Riak-Deleted\\* to determine when a delete has occurred.

Any idea why this would no longer be true?
