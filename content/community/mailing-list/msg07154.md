I think that being able to have a native erlang interface to a riak cluster 
would be a "Good Thing." I can imagine some compute applications that could 
benefit from having access to data at the speed of network but not actually be 
a member of the storage pool.

Just watched Rich Hickey discussing similar concepts employed in his new 
system, Datomic, here, http://www.infoq.com/interviews/hickey-datomic . Worth 
the 30min.

&gt; The native Erlang client was never designed to be used in this fashion, as 
&gt; you are finding out first hand. You are correct in that some operations 
&gt; assume they are running on the Riak VM, e.g. mapred\\_dynamic\\_inputs\\_stream.
&gt; 
&gt; Normally I would say not to establish a Erlang dist connection to the Riak 
&gt; cluster but given you need a work around for the performance issue it seems 
&gt; to be your only good choice ATM. You can use `rpc:call` to invoke the mapred 
&gt; queries.

&gt; In case anyone else is wondering, the answer is no, the native client

&gt; 
&gt; I started a hidden node and connected to one of my Riak nodes using
&gt; riak:client\\_connect. The returned client is able to successfully
&gt; execute Client:get(Bucket, Key) (and probably other simple things like
&gt; put/delete), but it fails on mapred with a {modfun, ...} input. 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that the native client tries to run the input function
&gt; on the local node, rather than the node the client points to, which of
&gt; course won't work unless the local node is participating in the Riak
&gt; cluster.

&gt; &gt; Is it OK to use Riak's native erlang client from an erlang node that's
&gt; &gt; connected to a Riak cluster via normal erlang distribution
&gt; &gt; (net\\_adm:ping etc.), but isn't participating in the Riak cluster? I'm
&gt; &gt; wondering if e.g. Riak makes any assumptions about nodes listed in
&gt; &gt; nodes(), or the nodes of processes running client code, that would
&gt; &gt; break if a node isn't running Riak.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm trying to figure out a fallback strategy in case I can't resolve
&gt; &gt; performance issues I'm seeing with the protocol buffers client (see
&gt; &gt; other thread about slow searches). The scariest option would be to
&gt; &gt; run my application on the same nodes as Riak, which seems like it
&gt; &gt; would complicate operations too much. Or if
&gt; &gt; connected-but-not-participating nodes aren't a good idea, maybe my
&gt; &gt; application nodes could each start a slave node with -hidden, which
&gt; &gt; would then connect to Riak and act as a proxy?
