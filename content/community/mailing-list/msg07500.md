It's only really that a significant portion of our application is in
the RDBMS so we can't invest the time to re-write and migrate at this
time. New features and services that makes sense are being moved off
on a case by case basis.

Thanks for the info about the status of Riak Search.

&gt;&gt; I can understand wanting to make Search more focused on indexing KV
&gt;&gt; data instead of a 'backdoor'. I was a little confused at first about
&gt;&gt; where the search data was being stored.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The confusion is one of the reason I want to see non-KV indexing go away.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We currently don't store the actual data in Riak because after the
&gt;&gt; Riak Search we still have to check permissions and retrieve the data
&gt;&gt; from our Relational DB. We've put searching into Riak to better
&gt;&gt; distribute the load, and have a quicker update to the search indexes
&gt;&gt; instead of having to commit/optimize with Solr. It was very convenient
&gt;&gt; to just point to the Riak search/update endpoint and speak the same
&gt;&gt; protocol even if the semantics are slightly different.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm glad Search is meeting your needs.  I'm curious what parts of RDBMS do
&gt; you need that prevented you from using Riak to store the data itself?
&gt;
&gt; There has been some internal discussion about not deprecating/killing the
&gt; solr emulation but instead moving it off into it's own layer/application
&gt; that sits atop Riak.  I thought you should know.
