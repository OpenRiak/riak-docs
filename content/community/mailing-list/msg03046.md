Hi there,

this wiki page sums it up pretty nicely: 
http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Querying.html#Querying-Integrated-with-Map-Reduce.
 It's just a different kind of input to MapReduce.

In PHP, you could simply do:

$result = $client-&gt;search("bucket", "this:that")
-&gt;map("function (v) { return [v.key]; }")
-&gt;reduce("Riak.reduceSort")
-&gt;run();
