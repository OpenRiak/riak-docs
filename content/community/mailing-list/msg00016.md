Hi,

Is there a way that an application can know that a read document has reached 
consistency? 

I assume that a value has reached consistency when the following are true:
1. All nodes are available.
2. All reached nodes agree on the version of the document.
3. There is no new document in a queue on a node that still needs to be 
submitted and is not consulted during reads.

The I see is that (3) can only be known by either consulting all nodes, or 
receiving a signal when the new document is being copied to another node.

Knowing about consistency allows to add caching on the client. This greatly 
boosts performance for many types of applications and especially web sites.

Kind Regards,

Marc Worrell
