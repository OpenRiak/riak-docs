That's my understanding as well. The memcache client determines what
server to store it's data on via the hashing process, so then if that
server dies, you lose that subset of data.


It's a cache, not a data store, so you don't lose data, you just have to 
refresh the cache like any other miss, and with the dead server removed 
from the list the clients will all adjust to using a different target 
(or just not caching that fraction, depending on your hash scheme).


But somehow membase is supposed to use the same client with persistent 
data on the server. I'm not sure how that works but I like the idea of 
clients that know how to load balance and fail over.
