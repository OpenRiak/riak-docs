&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any information when the Riak Search will be publicly available?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sometimes development of a new product takes far less time than
&gt; expected. More often, however, it takes longer than expected, and Riak
&gt; Search is no exception. Trust me when I say that Basho and the Search
&gt; team are as excited to release the code as you are to get your hands
&gt; on it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your patience.
