Hey all,

i'm having trouble articulating for colleagues why using vnode\\_vclock=true
in Riak 1.0 avoids the issues outlined in the Vector Clocks are Hard page.
This is probably a sign that i don't understand it well enough myself.

My understanding is that requests to a vnode are processed in serial so
that the vector clock updates in a vnode are guaranteed to not create
duplicates for a particular object (causing the data loss.) If this is
correct, does it mean that write operations are done in serial, or that
both read and writes are processed in serial? Also is it still just using
an incrementing number or using something like a timestamp as the vector
clock value for the client?

 I would love to be able to get a good explanation for this so I can
understand it better myself and so that I can articulate it to colleagues.

Thanks,
Adam
