Tried setting up a riak 4 node dev cluster on an EC2 box today per the 
instructions.

Seems to work fine for any requests to 127.0.0.1 However, when I try to remote 
in (from my desktop to the EC2 box)...I get no response.

I assume this is because I need to configure app.config and vm.args with 
something like:

{http, [ {"",  } ]},

-name devN@


respectively....instead of 127.0.0.1. However, when I made modifications to the 
required files...by using my EC2 box's elastic IP, and I try to start...it just 
sits there and hangs...

Is there some secret sauce needed to get the dev environment working with 
remote IP's?

thanks.
