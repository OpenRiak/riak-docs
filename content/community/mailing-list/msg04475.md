Has anyone begun work on a Riak extension for PHP (which ideally would make
use of PB)?
I'd love to see something like that started, or if someone already has code,
open-source it so others of us can pitch in.

Would be great to see a Riak extension exist, so that Mongo has one less
advantage in the PHP realm (Mongo extension:
