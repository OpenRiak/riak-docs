Hi Oved. If Riak search is anything like Lucene search, the correct way to
query that would be:

Name:c1 OR Name:c2

Did you try that? I believe this also works in lucene: Name:(c1 OR c2)

Sorry to answer without actually trying this on Riak, just from my Lucene
experience. But it's worth a try. Any attribute without a prefix is
interpreted as that value in the default search field.

Cheers

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I am trying to perform queries using the OR operator as following:
&gt; MapReduceResult result = riakClient.
&gt; mapReduce("some\\_bucket", "Name:c1 OR c2").
&gt; addMapPhase(new NamedJSFunction("Riak.mapValuesJson"), true).
&gt; execute();
&gt;
&gt; I only get the 1st object in the query (where name='c1'). If I change the
&gt; order of the query (i.e. Name:c2 OR c1) again I get only the first object
&gt; in query (where name='c2').
&gt; is the OR operator (and other query operators) supported in the java
&gt; client?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
