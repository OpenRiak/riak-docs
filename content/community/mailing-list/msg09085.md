Hello, I am attempting to create a 4 node riak installation on 4 separate 
CentOS servers. Installation of Riak went well. We have run simple tests 
like riak ping, sudo curl \\-v http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/test, ect, and 
everything seems fine with the riak servers, they all start up with no errors. 
 We used the default ports in the app.config files. Ie: epmd listener: 
TCP:4369
handoff\\_port listener: TCP:8099
web\\_port: TCP:8098
pb\\_port: TCP:8087

We have updated all ip addresses in the config files as instructed on the riak 
site. Also, we have verified by telnet that the ports are all open and that I 
can telnet between the riak servers. Still after all of that, when I try to 
do a cluster command I get the following response:


[root@essd-riak-test-server ~]# riak-admin cluster join riak@10.1.78.9
Attempting to restart script through sudo -H -u riak
Node riak@10.1.78.9 is not reachable!
[root@essd-riak-test-server ~]#

I have been stuck on this issue for quite a while and tried everything I found 
on the riak web site to resolve this. Any help you could offer would greatly 
be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

James Sweeney
