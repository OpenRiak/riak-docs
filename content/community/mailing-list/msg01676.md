I'm running the pre-built binaries for Riak 0.13 (and 0.12 x64, for that 
matter) for OS X 10.6.

When I do a "riak stop", there is one process still running. The epmd -daemon 
process. I have to kill it manually.

In my testing, I'm starting 0.13, running a test, then shutting it down, 
starting 0.12 and running another test. If I'm not switching versions, then I 
just leave it running.

Will this cause a problem if I restart the server and leave this last process 
running? What about if I switch from 0.13 to 0.12 (or vice versa)? Will it 
interfere with anything? Do I even need to kill it?

Thanks!
