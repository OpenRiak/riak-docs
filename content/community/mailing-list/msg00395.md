&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; when calling the filter\\_keys/2 API with innostore configured as backend I get 
&gt; the following error in the riak node.
&gt; 
&gt; {badarg,[{innostore\\_riak,list\\_bucket,2},
&gt; {riak\\_vnode,do\\_list\\_bucket,6},
&gt; {riak\\_vnode,active,2},
&gt; {gen\\_fsm,handle\\_msg,7},
&gt; {proc\\_lib,init\\_p\\_do\\_apply,3}]}
&gt; 
&gt; Looking at innostore\\_riak.erl it seems to me that list\\_bucket/2 doesn't 
&gt; expect to receive a tuple such as {filter, Bucket, Fun} as second argument.
&gt; It's easy to fix and we got it working, just wondering if you know about it...
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards
&gt; Francesca
