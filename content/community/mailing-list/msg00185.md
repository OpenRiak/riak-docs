Hi,

I did some testing between dets and innostore for storage backend which
store 200k of data with same structure. Using default configuration for both
storage backend, running on singgle node and bucket's allow\\_multi set to
false.

Data example : [{field, "value"}, {field, "value"}, {field, "value"}]

I found out that storing 200k of data sequentially into dets is a lot more
faster than storing into innodb and dets only use around 350MB space while
innodb use around 1.1GB.

Also, in my other test which store 1 million data into dets, it only use
around 700MB++ of space (same data structure above).

It is recommended to use innostore for production right?What should I do to
make it better.

Regards,
Abe
