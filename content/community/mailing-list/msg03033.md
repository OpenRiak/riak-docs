&gt; We do need to solve the make/gmake issue in erlang\\_js (its hardcoded to
&gt; make in rebar.config). I was thinking a little wrapper script that would
&gt; use 'gmake' if available and fall back on 'make' if its not.
&gt;

There's a few ways to tackle this.

1. GNUMakefile instead of Makefile
2. Allow overriding the configuration
3. Platform specific include files for configuration based on uname.

I've only just started bumping into this problem, so I'm sure you guys are a
bit ahead of me :-).

My biggest concern is getting the changes upstream so a port is not
necessary.
