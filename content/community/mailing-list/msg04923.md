I've seen that article before, good read.
I wouldn't mind building something like that for personal use...

&gt; &gt; unfortunately our demand for capacity is increasing faster than
&gt; anticipated,
&gt; &gt; so waiting for ceph to become stable isn't an option anymore. we don't
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; human resources for developing a good fuse bindings ourselves.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; of course, if we don't find anything, we can simply scale out our
&gt; &gt; active/passive architecture we're running at the moment, but this gets
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; and more complicated, the more servers we throw in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; that's why i'm looking for some beautiful and simple design that
&gt; minimizes
&gt; &gt; the possibility of administrative failures.
&gt;
&gt; Probably very off-topic here but we all have to deal with hardware at
&gt; some level and this is an interesting brute-force approach to
&gt; capacity:

&gt; I believe they only provide an http layer for access, not file system
&gt; emulation though, and the software isn't open source.
