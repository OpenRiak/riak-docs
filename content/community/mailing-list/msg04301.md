Hmm. Not that I know of. Afaik, the memcache server itself is 
standalone. Any distributed magic happens at the client level via some 
circular hashing voodoo or sharding pixie dust. Keep the client mojo 
and swap memcached for redis.

Outside of legacy concerns I have no idea why someone would select

The main point of memcache is that it is distributed and the clients 
automatically handle failover at any reasonably large scale. How do 
you arrange that with redis?
