I've been reading in the archives about setting the node name in vm.args to
something durable and that you can reuse if you want to restore a node from
a backup. What would happen if there was a mistmatch is not stated, but the
implication it that restore would fail.

Is that the case?

Can you change the -name value in vm.args of a node that has already joined
a cluster (e.g. shutdown the node, change the name, and restarted it)?
