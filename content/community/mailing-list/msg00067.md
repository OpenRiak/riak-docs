For innostore I believe there is a maximum key size of 255 bytes.

&gt; You might run into URL length issues, depending on the client libs used,
&gt; and/or the HTTP interface might have issues with URLs that long but I think
&gt; the underpinnings should work with long keys just fine. Obviously, you're
&gt; creating additional overhead with large keys -- replicas and such -- but it
&gt; should Just Work otherwise.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is or is there a maximum key length in Riak? Either natively or in
&gt; the HTTP interface?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My use case is keeping inheritance in it's own key so for example, I have
&gt; two keys, "A" and "B" and I want to keep a third key "A,B". You see that the
&gt; key length is a function of member key size times number of members. Knowing
&gt; length would give me an aproximation of depth.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you,
&gt; &gt; Alexander
