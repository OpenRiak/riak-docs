No that's the only error. It may be that there were older errors which rolled 
out but I would expect a rolling restart would result in at least new errors 
but no. It's been 30 hours or so since the restart and still the same output 
from riak-admin transfers

I guess I might be able to stop all the nodes but I hate to do that as it 
degrades my service but I can only assume its already degraded?

Is there functions I could run while attached to get more information?

&gt; Anthony,
&gt; 
&gt; The primary partition warning suggests that a vnode that should be
&gt; running on your node is not running. After a restart, all primary
&gt; vnodes are started, which is why the primary warning goes away.
&gt; However, the fact that the warning re-appears is unexpected. The
&gt; handoff receiver errors also suggests that a vnode that was running
&gt; (and receiving handoff data) suddenly shutdown. This is likely the
&gt; same vnode.
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any other details in your logs that would indicate why a
&gt; vnode is shutting down and/or crashing? Any messages about issues
&gt; reading in the Bitcask data for any vnodes?

&gt;&gt; Hi,

&gt;&gt; I have a 12 node riak cluster running riak 0.14.2. I had several nodes

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I tried strobing through restarting all nodes, which seemed temporarily
&gt;&gt; fix this particular node, but then I think this error cropped up.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If there's anything I can try or more information I can give let me know.
&gt;&gt; The boxes are 16 core, 24 GB memory, with data in bitcask on an SSD drive,
&gt;&gt; there are 1024 partitions spread across 12 machines. Each machine does
&gt;&gt; roughly 55-120K vnode gets per second, 20-40K node gets per second, 1-2K
&gt;&gt; vnode puts, and 1-2K node puts.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the help,
&gt;&gt;
