Steve -

Honestly, don't know. I think I've had that thought at least once :) 

I've got a couple things that I'm working on at the moment that need to get 
done for the Riak 1.2 release, but when I get a chance I'll take a look at it 
and see if there's any harm. 

Thanks,
Brian Roach

&gt; Thanks for the reply! That's what I did (I expose Riak as spring beans and so 
&gt; destroy on context shutdown). But why not set the threads to deamon mode 
&gt; since they're support threads and avoid the issue altogether? Is it just too 
&gt; deep in another library or some other concern I don't understand?

&gt; Call the IRIakClient.shutdown() method when you're done with it - it'll kill 
&gt; the background threads.

&gt; &gt; I've noticed that while using the java client library the jvm is not 
&gt; &gt; exiting when main completes. Is there a way to set the connection threads 
&gt; &gt; to daemon mode so they don't hang the jvm?
&gt; &gt;
