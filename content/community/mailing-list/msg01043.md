Hi, Gavin.

A couple of things you may be interested in:

 - There have been improvements in both Bitcask and Riak since 0.12.1
(in tip of trunk and will be in the next release) to speed up (and
reduce the resource consumption of) key listing.

 - You should probably use keys=stream in your requests instead of
keys=true, to avoid the full keylist (and Link header) being built up
all at once.

Between those two items, you may have all that you need. I hope this helps.

-Justin
