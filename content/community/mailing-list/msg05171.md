&gt; Hello,

&gt; I recall with using the bitcask backend you could backup the cluster data
&gt; simply by copying the data directories of each node. You could then restore
&gt; by copy the data back to the data folder should something bad happen. Does
&gt; this also apply to the leveldb backend?

&gt; Thanks,
