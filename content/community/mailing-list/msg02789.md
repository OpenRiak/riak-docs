"devrel" is not a version. It's a makefile setting that makes 3 
installations with the correct cinfig settings such that the 3 can be 
joined together.

For the general and common cases of testing - ie development,
verifying application and cluster behavior in case of failures etc a
simple "make devrel" works fine for me. I run Riak directly on my 
MBP.


As others have pointed out - load testing and tuning for production 
is

another story.


What would have to be changed from the devrel version to get 
something where you could simply add other nodes to migrate to 
production - and maybe eventually remove the originals?
