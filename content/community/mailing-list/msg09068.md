Can somebody explain in more detail how the aliases parameter on the search
schema definition works? The documentation says it lets me
index multiple fields into one, so I tried to setup some schemas to let me
search on Name, that is actually the combined data of FirstName, LastName,
& MiddleName. I've got the search working for the properties by themselves,
but I can't seem to make the aliases work, so I'm either doing something
wrong or I misunderstood how they are supposed to work.


Schema Example:

I would really like this to work...but querying on Name never returns any
results.

{
 schema,
 [
 {version, "1.1"},
 {n\\_val, 3},
 {default\\_field, "Name"},
 {analyzer\\_factory, {erlang, text\\_analyzers, noop\\_analyzer\\_factory}}
 ],
 [
{field, [
 {name, "FirstName"},
 {analyzer\\_factory, {erlang, text\\_analyzers, standard\\_analyzer\\_factory}}
]},
{field, [
 {name, "MiddleName"},
 {analyzer\\_factory, {erlang, text\\_analyzers, standard\\_analyzer\\_factory}}
]},
{field, [
 {name, "LastName"},
 {analyzer\\_factory, {erlang, text\\_analyzers, standard\\_analyzer\\_factory}}
]},
{field, [
 {name, "Name"},
 {analyzer\\_factory, {erlang, text\\_analyzers, standard\\_analyzer\\_factory}},
 {aliases, ["LastName","FirstName","MiddleName"]}
]},
{dynamic\\_field, [
 {name, "\\*"},
 {skip, true}
]}
 ]
}.
