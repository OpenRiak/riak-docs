&gt; Hi,
&gt; I'm trying to write a simple precommit hook to modify a JSON object by

&gt; the object's value with mochijson2, remove the fields I don't want,
&gt; re-encode it, and update the value.
&gt; What happens, though, is my object ends up somehow mangled. When I inspect
&gt; it via curl, it sort of looks like JSON, but characters like "{" and ":"
&gt; seem to be replaced with garbage.
&gt; For example, what should read "hostname":"www.google.com" looks
&gt; likeÂ hostnamea"ja:la"mwww.google.coma"j

If I had to guess, I would say that you are seeing some sort of weird
unicode encoding of the double-quote character; maybe the data stored
was UTF-16 encoded? I.e. is there some unicode character that would
display a " but actually be stored as [a, "]?
