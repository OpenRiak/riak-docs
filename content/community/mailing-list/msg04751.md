Great, so if we build riak 1.0.0pre3 and enable riak search in app.config (per 
RELEASE-NOTES.org) and switch to {storage\\_backend, 
riak\\_kv\\_eleveldb\\_backend} then we'll be using leveldb for the kv backend and 
riak search will be in effect?

Craig,

Just in case I misinterpreted your question, I want to clarify. The search 
indexes themselves are stored in a merge\\_index backend, and in the future we 
may also support a leveldb backend for those search indexes. In terms of what 
storage backends work with search, all of them do.

All backends should support Riak Search, as the index is populated by a

Does the leveldb backend support riak search, or will it support it soon?
