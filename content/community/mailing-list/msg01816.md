Hi all,

I'm evaluating schemaless datastores as a foundation for a reporting software. 
Do you care to help me with a few questions about Riak?

\\* Is it ok to have a high number of buckets, one for each uploaded chunk of 
data? Will it affect performance as the number of buckets grows? I'm thinking 
about thousands of buckets.

\\* Can I map-reduce over all elements of a number of buckets in one step? Ie 
grouping and counting the number of elements in multiple buckets that match a 
set of criteria?

\\* Can I have custom function libraries to be used by map-reduce code written in 
Javascript? Or what would be the best solution to have libraries with standard 
mathematical/statistical functions?

\\* Does riaksearch (aka. Lucene) will help to speed up attribute-based queries, 
or is it used for fulltext searches only?

I'd appreciate it if you'd help me understand Riak properly. Kind regards,

Christian
