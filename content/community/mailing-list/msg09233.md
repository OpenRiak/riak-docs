If you edit /etc/init.d/riak you should see a line like:

 su - riak -c "$DAEMON $DAEMON\\_ARGS" || return 2

in the "do\\_start" function.

If you change that line into the following 4 lines:

 su - riak -c "/path/to/your/riak/dev1/bin/riak $DAEMON\\_ARGS" || 
return 2
 su - riak -c "/path/to/your/riak/dev2/bin/riak $DAEMON\\_ARGS" || 
return 2
 su - riak -c "/path/to/your/riak/dev3/bin/riak $DAEMON\\_ARGS" || 
return 2
 su - riak -c "/path/to/your/riak/dev4/bin/riak $DAEMON\\_ARGS" || 
return 2


it should start all your Riak nodes on boot.

The problem I see is that since this script is just functions if I run
it then it will do nothing as the functions are not called. Is there
some kind of “include” that I am missing?

Thank you for the link for the tutorial. I am still not sure what the
sequence should be for calling your script on startup. All of the
examples that I have seen startup a single executable. It looks like I
need to either include your script into another script and start it or .
. . .
