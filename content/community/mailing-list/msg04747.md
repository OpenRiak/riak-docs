Hi all,

I'm performing queries to an index using riak client, indexing data from
models for a new Rails app. Making the first tests on the search I have
found that those queries must match the case that was used.

Is there some option for make the queries indiferent of the case? Or, must I
take care of case indexing? (just downcase them or whatever) I saw at the
source code for search and just the options are for format of answer, sort,
start row and number of rows.


Just a sample I'm telling:

ruby-1.9.2-p136 :049 &gt; client.search("users", "name:ant\\*")
 =&gt; {"responseHeader"=&gt;{"status"=&gt;0, "QTime"=&gt;6,
"params"=&gt;{"q"=&gt;"name:ant\\*", "q.op"=&gt;"or", "filter"=&gt;"", "wt"=&gt;"json"}},
"response"=&gt;{"numFound"=&gt;0, "start"=&gt;0, "maxScore"=&gt;"0.0", "docs"=&gt;[]}}
ruby-1.9.2-p136 :050 &gt; client.search("users", "name:Ant\\*")
 =&gt; {"responseHeader"=&gt;{"status"=&gt;0, "QTime"=&gt;6,
"params"=&gt;{"q"=&gt;"name:Ant\\*", "q.op"=&gt;"or", "filter"=&gt;"", "df"=&gt;"value",
"wt"=&gt;"json", "version"=&gt;"1.1", "rows"=&gt;1}}, "response"=&gt;{"numFound"=&gt;1,
"start"=&gt;0, "maxScore"=&gt;"0.00000e+0", "docs"=&gt;[{"id"=&gt;"1326d69a3bb001001",
"index"=&gt;"users", "fields"=&gt;{"name"=&gt;"Antonio Fernández",
"slug"=&gt;"antonio-fernandez"}, "props"=&gt;{}}]}}
ruby-1.9.2-p136 :051 &gt;


Also there is another question, since look for keys in buckets is just a
mistake, it could be nice to be able to query all the objects from an index,
just I could using 2 letters and \\* as minimum. (I used sunspot gem that
works with solr and without any query term it allows you to get all the
results. not sure is there is an option for that here)

Thank you in advance,

Antonio
