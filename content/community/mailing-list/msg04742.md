&gt; Thanks Rusell. I compiled the master code base but still I couldn't find the 
&gt; way to link way in pb.

Have a look at this test[1]. It is exactly the same for both HTTP and PB, it 
uses subclasses to create the clients, but codes to the interface.

Most of the code in the test is setup (to store the graph of linked objects), 
the pertinent code is on line 89[2]. To do this over protocol buffers just 
create a PB client, the test creates one here[3].

Hope that helps, let me know if it works for you.

Cheers

Russell

&gt; &gt; I learnt from the mailing list that there is no direct way to link walk on 
&gt; &gt; PBClient as we do with HttpClient.
&gt; &gt; Has any one implemented it on their own. If so, kindly share me the patch.
&gt; 
&gt; You can with the 0-15-SNAPSHOT riak-java-client from master. Though it is 
&gt; actually implemented as 2 Map/reduce operations.
