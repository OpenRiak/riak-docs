You can perform a rolling upgrade of each of the existing Riak nodes to bring 
your 0.14.2 bitcask Riak up to a 1.0.0 bitcask Riak.

Unfortunately, there's no way to convert from one backend data store to another 
apart from re-writing all of your keys into a new bucket with the appropriate 
storage configuration and then deleting them from the original bucket. You 
could also stand up another cluster on a different set of machines and just 
read out of the 0.14.2 cluster into the 1.0.0 cluster.

Hope that helps,
