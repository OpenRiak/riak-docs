Very good idea!

2010/10/28 Prometheus WillSurvive :
&gt; Hi All,
&gt; We have prepare wikipedia database output ready to submit RiakSearch. It is
&gt; XML and described format for solr submit. Each file has 20.000 Document and
&gt; totaly 15 xml files. Each file around 44 MB.
&gt; You can submit all XML 's =    bin/search-cmd solr wikipedia
&gt; /wikipedia/content-xml-out/wikipedia\\_1.xml
&gt; So you only need to submit this files to the riaksearch and than make a
&gt; benchmark test/tune and share your experience.
&gt; I would like to ask Riak Admin guys is there any place that I can share
&gt; these files for public access to start collaborative tests  ?
&gt; Second phase I can put 3 million wikipedia XML sets to ready to submit
&gt; riaksearch. So All we have some common benchmark and tuning parameters.
&gt; I hope this will help the riaksearch community to better understanding its
&gt; capability.
&gt; Best Regards
&gt;
&gt;
