Has there been any development in this area? I saw this:

http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\\_lists.basho.com/2011-August/005228.html

But I wondered if any clear "official" or "least horrible" path existed now.

I mean, it only seems logical that Riak run on the flavor of Unix preferred by 
literally 100% of people without debate or contention.

Thanks,
Tim
