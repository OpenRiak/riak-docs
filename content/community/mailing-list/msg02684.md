4) Just got the word that newly-minted Basho hacker Mathias Meyer will
be at the Scottish Ruby Conference at the beginning of April. If
you're planning to be there make sure to corner Mathias and ask him
for some stickers.

sponsorship page if you're so inclined ---&gt;

5) KevBurnsJr let it leak that his new application,
http://podcastle.us/, is using Riak for primary storage. It's also
using the Ripple-PHP code he's been working on. Check it out here -

6) Runar Jordahl put together a quick post about why he chose to write
a Pharoah Smalltalk interface.

riak search at the same time? (from vicmargar via #riak)

 A -- At the moment this is not possible.
