curious.

&gt; Ken,
&gt;
&gt; Not that this error msg is descriptive at all but it means that a range
&gt; query is running and it timed out because merge index took too long to
&gt; respond.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is this happening for all queries?
&gt;
&gt; 2. If not, do you by any chance log the queries you run in your
&gt; application? If so it would be nice to correlate a query to a timeout.
&gt; Barring this, can you correlate the timeouts with anything?
&gt;
&gt; 3. What does iostat -x 1 look like during these timeouts? What about
&gt; other things like vmstat?
&gt;
&gt; 4. Any other errors in the logs?

&gt;&gt; We keep getting the following error in production:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; @riak\\_search\\_backend:collect\\_info\\_response:55 range\\_loop timed out!
&gt;&gt; @riak\\_solr\\_searcher\\_wm:malformed\\_request:82 Unable to parse request:
&gt;&gt; {timeout,range\\_loop}
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We don't any feedback as to what the query was that generated the
&gt;&gt; problem, nor do we have a consistent repro.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Has anyone else seen this error or can anyone help us with figuring what
&gt;&gt; this is and how to prevent it?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
