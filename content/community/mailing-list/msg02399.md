There's a practical limit around 64MB. For a small document, that's a LOT of 
versions. That said, in some cases it would make sense to store the historical 
versions in a separate object or collection of objects.

&gt; Hi there,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the obscured title. Basically what I want to do is to store
&gt; all my revisions (as JSON documents) as an array inside the parent.
&gt; 
&gt; e.g:
&gt; 
&gt; Document1: "doc\\_name : bar, revisions: [ { revision:1, doc\\_name:bar },
&gt; { revision: 2, doc\\_name: foo } ] "
&gt; 
&gt; where Document1 is riak object key. So as there are more revision, the
&gt; value will get larger. My concern is there is a limitation on how big
&gt; the value is.
&gt; 
&gt; Is my concern reasonable? If so, what is the maximum size of value in
&gt; riak key-value store?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for the assistance.
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; Joshua.
