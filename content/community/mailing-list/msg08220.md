Sorry for the double email, hit the send key combo accidentally.

If there are, I can get the Capital Factory guys to host a meet up/get together 
(I'm a tenant in their gorgeous office space).

&gt; As many of you already know, Basho is largely a distributed company

&gt; coffee shops, and co-working spaces across the country. There's no
&gt; reason you need to live near one of our offices in order to interact
&gt; with Basho engineers and developer advocates -- we're everywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; With that said, I'd like to set something up in Seattle to engage with
&gt; local Riak users and enthusiasts.
&gt; 
&gt; Some thoughts:
&gt; -- Weekly office hours at a coffee shop or co-working location.
&gt; -- Monthly or bi-monthly Riak meetup.
&gt; -- Monthly or bi-monthly Riak drinkup.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anyone in the Seattle area who finds any of these ideas
&gt; interesting? Have a preference? Have other suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; In short, I'm soliciting any and all feedback. Is anyone in the
&gt; Seattle area interested in having weekly/monthly access to come in and
&gt; pester me (senior engineer at Basho) about anything and everything?
