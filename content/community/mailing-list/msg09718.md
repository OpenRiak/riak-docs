Hello Riak Users,

For those of you who missed the announcement on Monday, Yokozuna 0.2.0 has
been released. This release includes two big features that I discussed in
my RICON talk [1] but hadn't yet been completed.

1) Active Anti-Entropy (AAE): This is a process that constantly verifies
that the data and it's corresponding indexes are in-sync. This is done in
the background, in an efficient manner, that should require no intervention
on the user's part.

2) Sibling Support: If allow\\_mult is set to true, meaning you want Riak to
store siblings when there is a conflict, then Yokozuna will index all
siblings. If a search matches any sibling of an object then it will be
included as a result. When an object's siblings are reconciled to one
version then all sibling indexes will be deleted.

To see a full list of changes checkout the Basho blog post linked below or
go directly to the 0.2.0 release notes if you prefer [2].
