&gt; I mistyped that indeed. The correct name is indeed riak-js on npmjs. Sorry!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you published in npm?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; npm install riak is for the mranney version.
&gt;&gt; It appears you mistyped the library name:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; https://npmjs.org/package/riak-js
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; npm install riak-js
