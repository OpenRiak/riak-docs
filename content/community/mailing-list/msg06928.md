Thanks, Sean!

What are the suggestions for solving this issue, except of cleaning data
before putting it to Riak?

&gt; Even if your map function doesn't use the object, the Erlang side doesn't
&gt; know that (Javascript funargs are exceptionally lazy anyway). It will still
&gt; try to serialize the object into JSON to send marshal it into the VM.
&gt; That's where the error is generated.

&gt;&gt; Good day!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As previously discussed here (
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/pull/252#issuecomment-4415767) I am
&gt;&gt; unable to perform MR on my cluster due to wrong encoding in some of my
&gt;&gt; values.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What are the suggestions for solving this issue, except of cleaning data

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why does even this map function fail "function map () { return [1]; }" ? It's
&gt;&gt; not supposed to parse the value.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance for any tips.
