&gt; What does your basho\\_bench config file look like?

&gt; Seeing a low number of ops/sec is usually an indicator that you're
&gt; hitting a bottleneck on the I/O path -- typically due to random reads.
&gt; LevelDB has a number of characteristics that can make this worse --
&gt; what happens if you use bitcask?

&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Here is my setup of Riak 1.1.4
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 5 Nodes
&gt;&gt; ami-a29943cb (EC2 AMI)
&gt;&gt; m1.large (7.5GB Ram, 4 EC2 compute instances)
&gt;&gt; EBS storage
I'd recommend giving ephemeral storage a shot as well. It tends to have 
significantly less variable performance than EBS.
&gt;&gt; LevelDB backend
&gt;&gt; Python Client with Protobuf (on a separate machine)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; While loading data I am getting around 50 ops/sec.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I tried running basho benchmark on the setup and it showed 100 ops/sec
&gt;&gt; throughput.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; After talking to people or Riak IRC, I realized that upwards of 1.5K ops/sec
&gt;&gt; is what I should be getting.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Could anyone help me in figuring out what I am doing wrong?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;
