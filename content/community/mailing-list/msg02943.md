Spent a little time poking at this today... Kind of surprised that there was
no message defined for PingReq or for listing buckets.

I realize these messages really have no usable payload, and just sort of
have a tag and length, but for completeness it kind of feels like they
should be there.

Of course I'm not a Protocol Buffers expert in any sense, so I can't say
whether this is a normal kind of choice or not.

&gt; &gt; I've been writing a bit of code in Haskell to push data to Riak, and the
&gt; bindings are pretty easy to use (Thanks Brian!), but getting penetration at
&gt; my company for Haskell is going to take a little time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As such I'm just wondering if anyone knows of anyone working on a
&gt; protocol buffers version of a Riak client in C++, or if this is going to be
&gt; something I'll have to take on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've found a few generic looking C++ projects that use Boost's
&gt; asynchronous IO stuff with protocol buffers to make an RPC system, but I'm
&gt; not sure if any of those are implicitly compatible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Guess I'm just looking for a pointer...
