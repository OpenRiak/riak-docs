To answer my own questionâ€¦

I did a `stop node`, and `mark down` through the Riak Control interface of the 
one stuck at 0.2% data (235) and trying to send files to 234.

leaving 0.2% 0.0% 'riak@10.0.0.235'

Then restarted 234:

leaving 15.6% 15.8% 'riak@10.0.0.234'

And joined it back to the cluster. (it was thinking it was a cluster of 1, 
though not reported as this way through Control or member\\_status.

Now it thinks it is back and ready for duty.

I'm pretty sure I had done both of these things before (marking as down, 
restarting, etc), but I guess the time wasn't right.

That is fine. At least the cluster is blowing chunks back and forth again like 
a good little party animal.

Hi All,

The following is about leveldb, riak (1.1.1 2012-03-07) RedHat x86\\_64, and one 
riak newbie known as me!

I had this problem over the weekend whereby two nodes are leaving and they are 
both stuck trying to send transfers from one to the other.

I had backed them up with tar, and after they became stuck, I tried launching 
new instances with those levedb tar file backups. But those new hosts, 
although listed in connected\\_nodes, are not in the ring\\_members.

Are there any work arounds to resolving the stuck ownership handoff between the 
two leaving nodes? I tried different scenarios of marking them as down. That 
didn't seem to help. ring\\_status indicated it wanted them down, then it wanted 
them back online. etc.

I don't really need either one. I'd like to eject them both from the cluster 
and have it rebalance onto the new nodes.


Both these were asked to leave:
Owner: riak@10.0.0.235
Next Owner: riak@10.0.0.234

ring\\_status output:
