&gt; Hi all,

&gt; I had a 4 node cluster (riak 1.0.2) on which I removed one node using
&gt; "riak-admin leave".
&gt; My node is now with the status "leaving", is it possible to cancel the
&gt; previous leave and have everything back to the way it were before?
&gt;

This isn't possible. You'll have to sit tight and let the node
complete the leave.
