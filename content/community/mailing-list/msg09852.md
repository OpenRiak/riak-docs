&gt; Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way that's as simple to do
&gt; pipe mapreduce jobs. I'll ping people and see if we can't get you all
&gt; some code that's slightly easier to use.

Pipe-based mapreduce is encapsulated in the `riak\\_kv\\_mrc\\_pipe` module.
Instead of `C:mapred...`, use `riak\\_kv\\_mrc\\_pipe:mapred...`. Note that
the next release of riak drops the `riak\\_client`, luke-based version,
and only the pipe-based version remains.
