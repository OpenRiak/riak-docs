Hi guys,
I've enabled Riak Search on my Riak 1.2.0-1 ring, put a schema on a bucket and 
pumped some data into it.

When I do a search, I receive a responseHeader that has a maxScore. That's 
great, but the score for the individual documents doesn't show. How do I get 
the score for the individual documents listed in my search? I want to use this 
to display to my users 1-5 stars of how well they matched.

Secondly, if I add a postfix \\* to any of my search terms, it searches fine, but 
maxScore says 0.00000e+0. Why is this?

And finally, if I add a weight after my postfix \\*, i.e. ^5, I get "Unable to 
parse request: {badmatch, {error, { lucene\\_parse, "syntax error before: 5.0" } 
} } Why is this? As far as I can understand from the docs, a query such as 
"title:listening\\*^5" should be fine?

Med Venlig Hilsen / With Kind Regards
