I installed riak v1.1.2 via the 64bit deb package a few days ago.

I have done almost nothing with it, there is only one server. But beam.smp
has already used up 15 mins of CPU according to 'top'.
When I watch 'top', beam.smp seems to be using up 0.01 second of the cpu
every second. This doesn't seem to happen with other databases.
