Jason,

You can't currently change the timeout on individual phases, just on the entire 
job. We're reprioritizing MapReduce to receive some extra love in the near 
future, so if that is a critical feature for you, be sure to file a bug on 
issues.basho.com.

&gt; Hi Sean,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks. Also, is there anyway to increase the javascript reduce phase
&gt; timeout? Doing some test M/R jobs, and the reduce phase doesn't seem
&gt; to honor the timeout passed in? Thought playing with streaming would
&gt; help that, but looks like not. Thank you in advance.

&gt;&gt; If your query has "keep":true on multiple phases, that phase key lets you

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; When running map/reduce in streaming mode, since the results are from
&gt;&gt;&gt; the last phase (reduce) what is the significance of the phase key?
&gt;&gt;&gt; (e.g. {"phase":1,"data":[3]} )
