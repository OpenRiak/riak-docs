&gt; Afternoon, Evening, Morning to All -
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a great Recap to take you into the weekend: blog posts, slides,
&gt; videos, new code, and more.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, to all our Riak users who happen to be on the East Coast of the
&gt; US this weekend: stay safe.
&gt; 
&gt; Enjoy.

&gt; Riak Recap for August 22 - 26
&gt; ======================
&gt; 
&gt; 1) A video of Rusty Klophaus' Secondary Indexing Talk from OSCON made
&gt; it onto Youtube. (The video quality is not the best, but it gets the
&gt; job done.)
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Watch here ---&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uExMXa4t8eg
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Joseph Lambert has two new Riak-related repos up on GitHub that are
&gt; definitely worth keeping an eye on. (He should also get some points
&gt; for one of the better GitHub nicks I've seen in a while.)

&gt; 
&gt; 3) Cody Soyland and Sean Cribbs collaborated to put together a Riak
&gt; Post Commit Hook that send writes to ZeroMQ.
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Details here ---&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 4) The slides from the talk I gave on Wednesday night at the Seattle
&gt; Scalability Meetup are now online.
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Check them out here ---&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 5) Adam Schepis wrote a script to update Riak Config Files (and turned
&gt; it into a blog post). He was also looking for some feedback on itâ€¦.

&gt; 
&gt; \\* Work with Node.js, Linux, Riak, and more
