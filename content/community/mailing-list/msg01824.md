Hi,

Actually, they're not timeout error but Not Found errors for a bunch
of keys that have been stored without error while the cluster is
rebalancing.

Is it "normal" to see Not Found errors while the cluster is
rebalancing? If not, what is my problem here? Is it a problem to
insert new keys while the cluster is rebalancing?

Again, I cannot find any error report other that riak-admin failing
with a timeout as described below.

Any help/hints approciated, thanks!

Colin

&gt; I just added a 4th node in my 0.10.1 + innostore cluster and I am
&gt; seeing all kind of timeouts both for retrieving objects and trying to
&gt; execute riak-admin status which gives me:
&gt;
&gt; RPC to 'r...@x.x.x' failed: {'EXIT',
&gt;                                     {timeout,
&gt;                                      {gen\\_server2,call,
&gt;                                       [riak\\_kv\\_stat,get\\_stats]}}}
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Also, the CPU load has seriously increased on the original 3 nodes.
&gt; The data rebalancing is quite slow.
&gt; I am not seeing anything wrong in the log files.
&gt;
&gt; Is this an indication that something is going wrong?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Colin
