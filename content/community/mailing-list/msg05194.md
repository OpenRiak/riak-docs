2011/10/18 Greg Stein :
&gt;&gt; "The unicode problem"[1][2]
&gt;&gt; makes it rather unusable for me with Python 2.7. :( (Not due to your
&gt;&gt; changes, but the Riak Python client in general)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; [1]: https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=649
&gt;&gt; [2]: https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/issues/32
&gt; What is it about 2.7 that makes the problem worse for you? Are you
&gt; using Unicode keys or bucket names?

(I just noticed I somehow managed to only send my response to Greg, so
reposting)

No, I'm not using unicode names at all. It's just that the json
implementation in Python 2.7 always yields unicode objects (unlike
simplejson with sometimes gives str objects and sometimes unicode
objects). Let me extract some code examples that triggers it.

(A little later)

Hrm.. Maybe my use cases are odd ball. Anything that involves Riak
search is busted[1], and it seems all the code I've been messing with
lately was using Riak Search in some way or form, so it feels very
debilitating. To work around it, I've hacked the riak client to
str()ify these things, which works great for me, since I know I'll
never do unicode keys or buckets, but I understand it's not generally
applicable.
