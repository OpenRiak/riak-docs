Hi, James.

Actually, Riak can store all Erlang terms: lists, tuples, numbers,
binaries, etc.

But if you use, for example, PHP or Python, you can just use your own
serialization format. So there are no problems here for any other
languages as well.

&gt; Hi guys,

&gt; Is there any plan for supporting more than opaque blobs as values in
&gt; the future? Â For example, lists, sets, hashes etc, including
&gt; server-side support for operating on those data-types?
&gt;
&gt; In the meantime, I am curious about the feasibility of putting
&gt; riak\\_core in front of Redis, and supporting a richer API in the layers
&gt; above (which I suspect would need to be heavily modified to support
&gt; additional value manipulation functionality).
&gt;
&gt; Also, is anyone aware of anyone attempting such a project?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
