If you can't wait for native geo-spatial indexes, there are also numerous
techniques for creating them over distributed hash tables (like Riak). In
some limited use-cases, you could create flat indexes directly in Riak,
where the keys are named for the distance along a space-filling curve (like
Hilbert, Lebesgue/Z-curve or Peano). The flat-index technique plays nicely
with Riak's existing MapReduce query system.

&gt; As you noted, we're sorta busy with the existing features for the next
&gt; major release. :) Insofar as counters go, we've had some discussion
&gt; about how to do them and may take a look at it after the release -- a
&gt; lot depends on customer needs.
&gt;
&gt; Can you elaborate on what you mean by offline/batch processing? We're
&gt; working on improving the usefulness of MapReduce w/ very large jobs,
&gt; but I'm not sure if that aligns with what you're asking about.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; D.
