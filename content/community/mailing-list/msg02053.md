Greetings All,

It is my understanding the only backend that is compatible with Riak Search 
indexes is the merge\\_index\\_backend.

I am wondering if merge\\_index backend has a similar memory footprint as 
bitcask; i.e., must the keydir structure for merge\\_index fit entirely in RAM as 
is the case with bitcask?

Many thanks!
