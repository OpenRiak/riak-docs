If you are a Java programmer who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and 
are interested in contract work, I invite you to apply for an opening we 
have at HP Labs in Palo Alto.

We are using Riak via the Java API, and have combined it with other 
interesting technologies such as the Play Framework and JQuery Mobile.


Thanks,
