Gareth,

On 0.10 you can execute this sequence of commands from the console (or 
riak-admin attach) of any node, to remove the node you want:

1&gt; {ok, Client} = riak:local\\_client().
2&gt; Client:remove\\_from\\_cluster('r...@10.1.5.37')

Of course, replace 'r...@10.1.5.37' with the name of the node you want to 
remove. Then use Ctrl-D to quit the shell but keep Erlang running.

&gt; so im performing a rolling upgrade from 0.10 to 0.11 and have found a problem 
&gt; with the transition document found here
&gt; http://hg.basho.com/riak/raw/efc290fd9c23/TRANSITION
&gt; 
&gt; long story short, section 1.2.2 says i need to run "riak-admin leave" but 
&gt; this is not an option for me. 
&gt; the release notes for 0.11 say "142 - riak-admin leave restored" which im 
&gt; guessing means that 0.10 isn't supposed to have that functionality
&gt; 
&gt; so because im using innostore at the moment, i figure i can update to v0.11 
&gt; without changing any config files and then when the node is at the correct 
&gt; version i can then hit the "riak-admin leave" button, switch the backend over 
&gt; to bitcask and then rejoin the cluster.
&gt; 
&gt; does that sound correct?
&gt; 
&gt; cheers, 
&gt; gareth stokes
