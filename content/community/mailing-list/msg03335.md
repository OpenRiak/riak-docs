Hi, Mike.

Assuming that the cluster is using the default storage engine
(bitcask) then the backup story is straightforward. Bitcask only ever
appends to files, and never re-opens a file for writing after it is
closed. This means that your favorite existing server filesystem
backup mechanism will Just Work.

Other means exist, but that is the simplest and often the best.
