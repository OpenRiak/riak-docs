Ahmed,

I think you'll find this resource useful, it contains some examples of how
to use PBClusterConfig:

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt; I currently have an app that uses the RiakClient/RiakObject interface
&gt; (fetch(),store(),etc) in lieu of the
&gt; IRiakClient/IRiakObject/FetchObject interface.
&gt;
&gt; Is there any way for me to continue using my code with
&gt; PBClusterConfig? It looks like I need to move to using IRiakClient in
&gt; order to take advantage of PBClusterConfig, is that so?
&gt;
&gt; Any insight would be appreciated, thanks!
