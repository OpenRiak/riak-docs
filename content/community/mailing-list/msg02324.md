Riak maintains a single value per key and provides mechanisms (vector
clocks) to detect/resolve conflicting values. In the proposed use case the
multiple copies would overwrite each other and Riak, by default, would
return a single value for a requested key.

Behind the scenes Riak determines the appropriate value per key using vector
clocks. More information about vector clocks is available here:

&gt; something reasonable regardless of cluster partitioning? And is this a
&gt; common usage scenario?
