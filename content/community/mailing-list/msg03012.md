The largest known riak cluster != the largest possible riak cluster. ;-)

The inter node communication of the cluster depends on the data set and usage 
pattern, doesn't it? Or is there some constant overhead that tops out at a few 
hundred nodes? I should point out that we'll have big data, but not a huge 
number of keys.

The number of vnodes in the cluster should be equal to the ring\\_creation\\_size 
under normal circumstances, shouldn't it? So when I have a one node cluster, 
that node is running ring\\_creation\\_size vnodes... File descriptors probably 
isn't a problem -- these machines won't be doing anything else, and the limits 
are set to 65536.

Thinking about the internode communication you mentioned, that's probably where 
the resource hog is.. socket buffers, etc.

Anyway, I'd also love to hear more from basho. :)
