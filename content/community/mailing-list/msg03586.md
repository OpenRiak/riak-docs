Hi all,

One of the things we've got cooking at Basho HQ is a plan to roll the
functionality currently in the riak\\_search project into the default
Riak distribution. This means that using riak\\_search will become a
matter of flipping a configuration switch versus running a whole
separate instance. This will make it easier to use and deploy .

As part of this merging process, we've realized that while having
Java-based analyzers is useful in some circumstances, it also imposes
a lot of overhead per search-query (if you're using it) and adds an
unwieldy dependency on the JDK to the Riak server. All the deployments
we're aware of do NOT use the Java-based analyzers; i.e. the default,
Erlang-based analyzers provide the necessary functionality with much
lower overhead.

So, I'm soliciting YOUR feedback on the removal of Java-based
analyzers in riak\\_search. Are you using it in production and would you
miss it if it was gone?

Thanks,

D.
