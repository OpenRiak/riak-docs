Thanks for all the suggestions. I will take some time to review and try
them out. I'll get back to this thread when I do.

&gt; Hi Matt,
&gt;
&gt; For stopping and starting rather than rebooting, you need to use
&gt; elastic IPs inside of Amazon's virtual private cloud[1] which allows
&gt; for persistent static private addresses.

&gt; &gt; A quick update on this subject.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Using an Elastic IP won't help with AWS since that only binds to the
&gt; public
&gt; &gt; interface - not the internal private one. The hostname command still
&gt; returns
&gt; &gt; the same internal IP address as before, which is what's seen by Riak.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In AWS an internal IP address will actually persist across reboots. It
&gt; does
&gt; &gt; not persist across shutdown and startup.
