Hi All,

I apologize if this has been covered already.

In the wiki it says "If keys=stream, the response will be transferred using 
chunked-encoding, where each chunk is a JSON object" (on 
http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/REST+API)

This doesn't seem to be the case, sometimes a json object is broken into 
several chunks. Is this behavior correct?

Thanks,

Adam
