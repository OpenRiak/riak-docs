Sean and All -

Some questions about the riak test server, as launched via the Ruby client...

Is there any problem having a test server running on the same machine as a 
normal riak server, as long as the port number's don't collide? Assuming 
single-server setups, do we need to be concerned about any ports other than the 
http\\_port and pb\\_port?

If in a Ruby program I start a Riak test server, then shell out to an 
executable (using system or ``), will the server be responsive and available 
while the parent program is waiting for the shell command's return?

Is it possible to persist a test server's data to a file, say, a JSON file, and 
then load it on startup? If so, how?

Thanks,
Keith
