&gt; Hey Ripple users,
&gt;
&gt; An awesome new feature is coming in Riak 0.14 (and already available on
&gt; master) that lets you filter keys in a MapReduce job before feeding them to
&gt; the query phases. Kevin Smith detailed their purpose and how to use them in
&gt; this presentation from the October Riak meetup in SF:
&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/hemulen/riak-mapred-preso
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to support them in riak-client by the time 0.14 is released, so
&gt; I'd appreciate your feedback on how the syntax should look/feel. I've
&gt; created a gist with some possibilities below, and I'm open to other
&gt; suggestions as well. Please comment!
