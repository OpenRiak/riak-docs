Set your R value equal to your N value when you read from Riak. Or if 
you want to know while you are writing, consult the W/DW values. -

Hi,

Is there a way that an application can know that a read document has 
reached consistency?


I assume that a value has reached consistency when the following are 
true:

1. All nodes are available.
2. All reached nodes agree on the version of the document.
3. There is no new document in a queue on a node that still needs to 
be submitted and is not consulted during reads.


The I see is that (3) can only be known by either consulting all 
nodes, or receiving a signal when the new document is being copied 
to another node.


Knowing about consistency allows to add caching on the client. This 
greatly boosts performance for many types of applications and 
especially web sites.


Kind Regards,
