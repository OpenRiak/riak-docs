&gt; You are right, I am using the default-one-node development cluster. After 
&gt; decreasing the ring size to 8 as mentioned by you, everything works fine.

Fantastic. I'm glad it worked out.

&gt; I will post your answer unter my question at Stackoverflow, if it is ok for 
&gt; you?

Please be my guest. I have little interest in maintaining an account
there myself.

Cheers,
Bryan
