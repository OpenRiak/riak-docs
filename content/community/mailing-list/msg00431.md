AFAIK, Riak's web client uses WebMachine, so maybe this is a bit
redundant. Nevertheless, check the Riak's sources, there should be
plenty of pointers to get you going..

&gt; I am new to Erlang but would like to give running Riak from Webmachine a try.
&gt;
&gt; I have been able to run the Erlang client from the shell based on this
&gt; documentation :  http://riak.basho.com/edoc/basic-client.txt
&gt;
&gt; But, I haven't found information on running the client from an
&gt; application like Webmachine.
&gt;
&gt; It may be as simple as placing some riak files in a directory, running
&gt; some commands, and declaring riak from the webmachine resource.  But,
&gt; as I'm still a newbie, not sure exactly how to approach it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for any assistance.
