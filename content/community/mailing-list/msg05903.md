Hi everybody

I've read an article of an erlang developper talking about his experience
with riak, and I'm a bit afraid on his conclusions because in the final, he
recommanded to use sql dtabases in kv-mode instead of riak!!!

here is the original russian link
http://lionet.livejournal.com/98362.html?utm\\_source=feedburner, and the
English Google translated link
http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Flionet.livejournal.com%2F98362.html%3Futm\\_source%3Dfeedburner

What do you think about that?
