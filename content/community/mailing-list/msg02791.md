Yes, the question is, what would you need to change in that initial setup to 
have something that would migrate, still running to some larger number of nodes 
on other machines? A larger number of partitions?

"devrel" is not a version. It's a makefile setting that makes 3 installations
with the correct cinfig settings such that the 3 can be joined together.

For the general and common cases of testing - ie development,
verifying application and cluster behavior in case of failures etc a
simple "make devrel" works fine for me. I run Riak directly on my MBP.

As others have pointed out - load testing and tuning for production is
another story.


What would have to be changed from the devrel version to get something where
you could simply add other nodes to migrate to production - and maybe
eventually remove the originals?
