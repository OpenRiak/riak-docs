I'd like to chime in here by noting that it would be incredibly nice if 
the client could distinguish between a record that is missing because 
the vnode is unavailable, and a record that truly does not exist. My 
consistency-repair system was running during partition handoff, 
determined that several thousand users were "deleted", and removed their 
following relationships.

Hello riak users!

I have a 4 node cluster that started out as 3 nodes. ring\\_creation\\_size
= 2048, target\\_n\\_val is default (4), and all buckets have n\\_val = 3.

When I joined the 4th node, for a few minutes some GETs were returning
'not found' for data that was already in riak. Eventually the data was
returned, due to read repair I would assume. Is this expected? It seems
that 'not found' and read repairs should only happen when something goes
wrong, like a node goes down. Not when adding a node to the cluster,
which is supposed to be part of normal operation!

Any help or insight is appreciated!
