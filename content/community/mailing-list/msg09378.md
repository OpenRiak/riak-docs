&gt;Alex,

&gt;The eleveldb backend creates a CRC for every item placed on the disk.
&gt;You can activate the test of the CRC on every read by adding:
&gt;
&gt; {verify\\_checksums, true},
&gt;
&gt;to the "{eleveldb " portion of app.config. With riak 1.2, you must
&gt;manually monitor each vnode directory for the lost/BLOCKS.bad file
&gt;changing size. It only increases upon read operations detecting a CRC
&gt;and/or compression corruption error.
&gt;
&gt;Manually monitoring the BLOCKS.bad file is tacky (my apologies). The
&gt;upcoming 1.3 release will populate riak admin with a counter of errors
&gt;seen. But that code is still weeks from release.

Thank you for working on this feature!

This is great to hear. A few questions about the new 1.3 functionality:
- What will happen to the read when this occurs?
- Will this trigger a read repair when it happens?
