I worked on different ways of making the new ulimit stick, and by far the best 
way I found is to create the file "/etc/default/riak" with the ulimit -n 
command in it:

ulimit -n 100000

This file gets sourced by the riak init script at startup, ensuring that the 
shell from which riak gets started has the appropriate ulimits set.

&gt; When i run this:
&gt; 
&gt; riak attach
&gt; return: Node is not running!
&gt; 
&gt; ulimit -n
&gt; return:1024
&gt; 
&gt; any hints to fix this?
&gt; Thanks a lot for helping.
