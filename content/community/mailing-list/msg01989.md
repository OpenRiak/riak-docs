&gt; Yes. Need to enable multi-backend in config file and then change bucket 
&gt; properties. It's in the wiki somewhere I think.
&gt; 

http://wiki.basho.com/Configuration-Files.html#app.config and scroll down a bit.

&gt;&gt; Hi, guys,
&gt;&gt; For example, log data (in log bucket) can store in bitcask-backend,
&gt;&gt; it's OK. But some data, such as session info which in session bucket,
&gt;&gt; should be better store in memeory.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So, can diverse store-backends be config to support different buckets?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Best regards
