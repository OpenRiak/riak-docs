Hi,

 Is it possible to store the whole database in memory?
 In a similar way as Redis does.

 I'm really interested in the distributed map reduce done by riak ("bring
processing to the data, instead of data to processors), but I need faster
writes/reads that a memory-only database could provide.
 In case you don't support memory-only storage (no disk touched / all keys
and data fitting the memory in all nodes) yet, do you plan on implementing
it?

Thank you,
Michael
