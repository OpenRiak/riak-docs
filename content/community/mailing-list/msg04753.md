&gt; Great, so if we build riak 1.0.0pre3 and enable riak search in app.config 
&gt; (per RELEASE-NOTES.org) and switch to 
&gt; {storage\\_backend, riak\\_kv\\_eleveldb\\_backend} then we'll be using leveldb for 
&gt; the kv backend and riak search will be in effect?

&gt; Craig,
&gt; 
&gt; Just in case I misinterpreted your question, I want to clarify. The search 
&gt; indexes themselves are stored in a merge\\_index backend, and in the future we 
&gt; may also support a leveldb backend for those search indexes. In terms of what 
&gt; storage backends work with search, all of them do.

&gt; All backends should support Riak Search, as the index is populated by a 
&gt; pre-commit hook.

&gt; Does the leveldb backend support riak search, or will it support it soon?
