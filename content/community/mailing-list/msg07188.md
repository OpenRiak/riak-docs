Thanks for the link; this is precisely what led me to believe that
PBClusterConfig only supports IRiakClient, so I thought I'd ask around
...

Also, if we create a RiakClient with a single host (and others exist),
is there any auto-dicovery that goes on to balance the requests across
ll ring members, or will that one host process all the app requests?

&gt; I think you'll find this resource useful, it contains some examples of how
&gt; to use
&gt; PBClusterConfig: https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/wiki/ClientFactory

&gt;&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I currently have an app that uses the RiakClient/RiakObject interface
&gt;&gt; (fetch(),store(),etc) in lieu of the
&gt;&gt; IRiakClient/IRiakObject/FetchObject interface.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is there any way for me to continue using my code with
&gt;&gt; PBClusterConfig?  It looks like I need to move to using IRiakClient in
&gt;&gt; order to take advantage of PBClusterConfig, is that so?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any insight would be appreciated, thanks!
&gt;&gt;
