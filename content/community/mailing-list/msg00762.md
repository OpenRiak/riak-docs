I don't want to have it constantly replicating, just when my application
needs it. I have an application where I will need to push a large chunk of
public data to, and Riak (and CouchDB) have already solved the hairy
replication issues for me, so I don't have to worry about determining
changes, etc. It does seem like Riak solves a more complex problem than
CouchDB in this way, or perhaps in a more elegant and robust way, which in
my case might be overkill.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt; &gt; Since this is running via Android Script Engine I assume this is
&gt; &gt; simply CouchDB running on erlang running on Android. Would this work
&gt; &gt; for Riak as well? Being able to replicate a store to a device fits
&gt; &gt; really well into an application I am working on.
