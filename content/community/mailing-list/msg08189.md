Hi,

I have yet to do MR for querying data but I am assuming I can query
across several buckets. This leads me to the question, can I have a
formated date as part of a bucket and when it comes time to to MR then
something like this

mybucket:2012\\_11\\_10
mybucket:2012\\_11\\_11
mybucket:2012\\_11\\_12

For keys, I am using uuid

Now, just MR on e.g. just mybucket:2012\\_11\\_11 and mybucket:2012\\_11\\_12?

I ask this for the following, I will log a ton of data, while at the
same time limiting search space, and also having the ability to drop
or archive data by bucket. I also want to limit my spend on storage.
If this is silly, what are best practice for dealing with time stamped
buckets?

Thanks
