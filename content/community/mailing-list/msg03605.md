as far as i can tell, bitcask c\\_src is using the murmurhash2 algo, which has
a known flaw ( https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/murmurhash2flaw )..
while this is not \\*likely\\* to cause an issue, I was wondering if there was a
reason that it does not use murmurhash3 ?

if this is not the appropriate list for this question, please let me know!
