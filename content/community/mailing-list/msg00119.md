Hi,
Have a look at this thread

http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\\_lists.basho.com/2010-April/000830.html

The issue is that the code needs to be on the riak node. I use the gist here 
http://gist.github.com/351659 from that thread in development to make sure my 
M/R funs are available.

HTH

&gt; I encounter the same problem with this guy 
&gt; http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\\_lists.basho.com/2010-March/000809.html
&gt; where I able to use qfun as fun term in riak/erlang console but failed when 
&gt; execute it from erlang module. It always returning "all nodes failed" error. 
&gt; Fyi, I able to use jsanon/jsfun as fun term and execute it from erlang module.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a workaround 
&gt; http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\\_lists.basho.com/2010-March/000810.html.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of using jsanon/jsfun and modfun as workaround, is there any solution 
&gt; if I still want to use qfun?
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Abe
