4. Add the concept of ordering (without having to fall back to
map/reduce). It's difficult to do paging without ordering, and most
webapps require it. In general, paging in RIak is hard, since
there's no concept of a range of results from a secondary index.

I thought there were range queries for secondary indices

I don't think that it guarantees ordering but you can grab a range.
In order to do paging, you really need a way to grab a set number of 
items in order. For example, give me the first 25 documents that match 
this secondary index. Or give me 25 documents starting at document 50 in 
the ordered list.


Today, we're working around this by grabbing all of the items and doing 
the paging client side (in javascript). That obviously won't scale past 
a few hundred items, however.
