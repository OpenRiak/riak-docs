Riak Recap for 6/25-6/27

1) grncdr and seancribbs had a brief conversation in #riak about using
MapReduce to move data from bucket to bucket.

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/455825

2) As acts\\_as pointed out in #riak, wiki.basho.com got a syntax
highlighting upgrade, as seen here ---&gt;
http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Erlang+Client+PBC

(h/t to Dan Reverri for making this happen!)

3) drev1 and BrianTheCoder talked a bit about schema design over the
weekend in #riak. The information is somewhat use-case specific but
still worthwhile for anyone trying to wrap their head around best
practices for schema design in Riak.

4) Q --- Anyone here that can tell me why when using links I could
only get 128 links on an object? (from hassox via #riak)

 A --- This is most likely problem with the HTTP Client. Many HTTP
implementations will fail in the face of very long header lines, and a
riak object with many links will result in a large "Link" header in
the response." If possible, check it with a Protocol Buffers client
and see if you still have the same problem.

5) @c141charlie has started work on a Riak Client for Google's "Go"
Language. (Thanks for putting some time against this, Charles!)

Github repo is here ---&gt; http://github.com/c141charlie/riak.go

Added to the Community Projects page on the Riak Wiki here ---&gt;

6) For anyone in (or wanting to be in) Portland, OR - @wbruce will be
talking Riak at the upcoming Devnation Portland, taking place on July
10th. From the talk's description: "This session will look at how Riak
is put together, some important characteristics that make it suited
(and not suited) for different problems, and how to get it
up-and-running quickly in a real application, with examples in Ruby
and Javascript."

More information and registration info here ---&gt; http://devnation.us/events/10

7) Fresh on the heels of his Java PB Client for Riak, the awesome
@drkrab posted a blog about getting Riak to play nice with Erjang.
Definitely worth the read...

8) Basho's own Rusty Klophaus has been hitting the conference trail
pretty hard as of late. He took a few minutes to write up his thoughts
on how to practice for technology talks. Definitely a good read for
all of you who are planning on giving Riak talks. (You will all be
giving talks on Riak, right?!)
