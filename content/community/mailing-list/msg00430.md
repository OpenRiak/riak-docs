I am new to Erlang but would like to give running Riak from Webmachine a try.

I have been able to run the Erlang client from the shell based on this
documentation : http://riak.basho.com/edoc/basic-client.txt

But, I haven't found information on running the client from an
application like Webmachine.

It may be as simple as placing some riak files in a directory, running
some commands, and declaring riak from the webmachine resource. But,
as I'm still a newbie, not sure exactly how to approach it.

Thanks in advance for any assistance.
