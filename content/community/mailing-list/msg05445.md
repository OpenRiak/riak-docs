RE: large ring size warning in the release notes, is the performance

is it best to keep ring sizes at 64 for best performance?

&gt; As we've mentioned earlier, the 1.0.2 release of Riak is coming soon. Like 
&gt; we did with Riak 1.0.0, we are provided a release candidate for test before 
&gt; we release 1.0.2 final.
&gt; 
&gt; You can find the packages here:

&gt; The release notes have been updated and can be found here:

&gt; Thank you, as always, for continuing to provide bug reports and feedback.
