+1 for a solid book on advanced Riak usage.

&gt; At this point Riak has been deployed thousands of times. This is excellent, 
&gt; but as you can imagine we here at Basho feel this is just the tip of the 
&gt; iceberg. We want everyone to be running Riak. The software obviously needs to 
&gt; solve enough problems for people to want to deploy it. However, we need to 
&gt; get the software into developers' hands before this happens. So the question 
&gt; is:
&gt; 
&gt; What can we be doing better?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not talking so much about features in Riak itself. I'm more interested in 
&gt; the other resources, tools, docs, processes, etc., that you think we need to 
&gt; put in place or refine to take the Riak community from 1000s of users to 
&gt; 100,000s of users. By virtue of being on this list, you've all spent some 
&gt; time using or investigating Riak. As such, you're opinions and experiences 
&gt; would be very valuable.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments, ideas, or thoughts you had would be great. On or off-list will 
&gt; work. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your time. Long live the vnode!
