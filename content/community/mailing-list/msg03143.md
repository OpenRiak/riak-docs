Riak Recap for April 22 - 24
=====================

1) Kresten Krab Thorup (@drkrab) released riak\\_btree\\_backend, a
backend for Riak based on couch\\_btree.

\\* Repo on GitHub here ---&gt; https://github.com/krestenkrab/riak\\_btree\\_backend

Thanks, Kresten!

2) Bob Ippolito (@etrepum) and Mochi Media released some new code
called "Statebox" which is an "Erlang state "monad" with
merge/conflict-resolution capabilities. As the README explains,
"statebox is a data structure you can use with an eventually
consistent system such as Riak to resolve conflicts between siblings
in a deterministic manner."

\\* On GitHub here ---&gt; https://github.com/mochi/statebox

Thanks, Bob!

3) Jean-Baptiste Barth (@jbbarth) wrote another great blog post on
Riak. This one is called, "Basic usage of Riak in Rails."

\\* Read here ---&gt; http://jbbarth.com/archives/2011/4/23/basic\\_usage\\_of\\_riak\\_in/

Thanks, JB!

4) Basho is sponsoring an event called "GeekSessions 2.1: Data
Scalability - SQL or NoSQL?" This is happening Tuesday, May 03, 2011
at 6PM. Come out and have a few drinks on us while debating databases.

\\* Registration and event details here ---&gt; http://gs21-estw.eventbrite.com/

5)There is still time to register for Dan Reverri's Riak Search talk
at the Bay Area Riak Meetup. It's happening Wednesday, 4/27, at IGN in
Downtown San Francisco. (Not that it matters to anyone, but the beer
and pizza will of course be on us...)
