Hi,

My 5-node cluster exhibits a strange spike on one particular node.

Overall, the mean get time is about 1ms. This node occasionally shoots up to 
40ms.

During those times, %iowait is still the same as it is before the spike. No 
error. Console log shows many lines like the below, which I don't think 
relevant to the spike.

2012-05-30 21:29:50.591 [info] 
&lt;0.72.0&gt;@riak\\_core\\_sysmon\\_handler:handle\\_event:85 monitor long\\_gc &lt;0.938.0&gt; 
[{initial\\_call,{riak\\_core\\_vnode,init,1}},{almost\\_current\\_function,{gen\\_fsm,loop,7}},{message\\_queue\\_len,0}]
 
[{timeout,185},{old\\_heap\\_block\\_size,0},{heap\\_block\\_size,2584},{mbuf\\_size,0},{stack\\_size,55},{old\\_heap\\_size,0},{heap\\_size,804}]

The cluster is set up uniformly. Ubuntu 64bit, m2.2xlarge instance. Riak 1.1.2 
with LevelDB backend.

What would be the best course of actions for me?

I plan to:

- riak-admin leave on that node
- set up new instance
- riak-admin reip the new instance
- riak-admin join it to the cluster

Cheers,
Nam
