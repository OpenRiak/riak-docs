&gt; I’m trying to use the output of a secondary index as the input to my

&gt; you've enabled Secondary Indexes, the list of inputs can also reference a
&gt; Secondary Index query'. However, I couldn’t find anywhere that explained

Hi, Barry. That wording is a little confusing … instead of a list, the
"inputs" field should be a JSON object like:

 {"bucket":"mybucket",
 "index":"myindex\\_bin",
 "key":"my exact match"}

or

 {"bucket":"mybucket",
 "index":"myindex\\_int",
 "start":0
 "end":100}

More complete examples are near the bottom of
