Riak Recap for Feb. 4 - Feb 6.

1) Basho Hacker Sean Cribbs wrote a great piece on Friday all about
spinning up local Riak clusters with Chef and Vagrant.

\\* Blog here ---&gt;
http://blog.basho.com/2011/02/04/creating-a-local-riak-cluster-with-vagrant-and-chef/

\\* In case you don't read the comments on that post, Susan Potter
posted her Vagrant and Chef config as an alternative. Check it out
here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/812241

2) seancribbs and mulander had a converasation in #riak that started
with "Is riak a good choice for collecting and analyzing device
readouts?"

\\* Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/814884

3) herewego and seancribbs had short chat in #riak that started with
"Anyone know if you can run multiple reduce phases in a map/reduce
query"

\\* Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/814901

4) Basho is organizing a monthly event called "KillDashNine." The
first one is happening this Wednesday, February 9, in San Francisco.
If you're in the area, and have Wednesday night free, come have a
drink on Basho's dime.
