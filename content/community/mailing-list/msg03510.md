Gordon,

Great news! Much appreciated.

&gt; Hey we are testing a fix now.  If this works I will send you a copy of the 
&gt; update file.

&gt;&gt; Hi Gordon,
&gt;&gt; Thank you for sharing the information.  We are seeing the same exact
&gt;&gt; type of behavior from our search cluster.  I have tracked the
&gt;&gt; problem(s) though the query system.  It looks like the mailboxes we
&gt;&gt; are both seeing are "abandoned" and / or the messages are never
&gt;&gt; matched within the Erlang code (it\\_op\\_collector\\_loop,
&gt;&gt; riak\\_search\\_op\\_utils.erl); the messages are then never processed,
&gt;&gt; therefore the resources they utilize never released.  This is a major
&gt;&gt; problem.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have been debugging this for some time and I wish I could say it was
&gt;&gt; going well.  The implementation is convoluted -- have you gotten
&gt;&gt; through it?  Can you verify the same cause?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We have been internally discussing the possibility of removing this
&gt;&gt; query processing implementation completely and replacing it with
&gt;&gt; something built in-house because the problems we have uncovered trying
&gt;&gt; to debug the "abandoned mailbox" problem are related and systemic:  1)
&gt;&gt; indeterminate and possibly very large data structures created and
&gt;&gt; manipulated for intermediate and final sets of results, 2) very poor
&gt;&gt; or non-existent ability to gain any insight into what is executing
&gt;&gt; within the "plumbing" of the current query execution system without
&gt;&gt; "herculean" effort (in my opinion), and 3) unacceptable performance
&gt;&gt; (predictably or subjectively) from the merge\\_index riak\\_search
&gt;&gt; backend.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are there any other backends available for riak\\_search with the
&gt;&gt; Enterprise Riak offering?  I really like the design of riak\\_search but
&gt;&gt; the performance seems to be only a very small fraction of our
&gt;&gt; equivalent SOLR installation, even with several times the amount of
&gt;&gt; resources "thrown at it" -- it does not seem to use resources we
&gt;&gt; "throw at it" well, either, or in the mailboxes case, responsibly.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I will quickly admit I may be doing something wrong.  Is there a
&gt;&gt; user-error situation in which mailboxes should be abandoned taking up
&gt;&gt; memory?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does anyone else have experiences with equivalent riak\\_search vs. SOLR
&gt;&gt; installations?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks again for sharing Gordon.  Your results make me feel like this
&gt;&gt; may not be entirely stupidity on my part.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Howdy Gilbert,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I reproduced the issue this morning and then ran the command that you
&gt;&gt;&gt; specified on two of the non-empty mailboxes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The output from that is posted here:
&gt;&gt;&gt; https://gist.github.com/1000735
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please let me know if this corresponds to the issue that you are seeing.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Gordon,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you try:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; erlang:process\\_info(list\\_to\\_pid("&lt;0.16614.32&gt;"), [messages,
&gt;&gt;&gt; current\\_function, initial\\_call, links, memory, status]).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; in a riak search console for one/some of those mailboxes and share the
&gt;&gt;&gt; results? I am curious to see if you are having the same systemic
&gt;&gt;&gt; memory consumption I am experiencing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Howdy Gang,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; We are having a bit of an issue with our 3-node riaksearch cluster.  What is
&gt;&gt;&gt; happing is this:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cluster is up and running.  We start testing our application against it.  As
&gt;&gt;&gt; the application runs the erlang process consumes more and more memory
&gt;&gt;&gt; without ever releasing it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; In trying to investigate the issue we ran the riaksearch-admin cluster\\_info
&gt;&gt;&gt; command.  It appears that the bulk of this memory is being consumed by a
&gt;&gt;&gt; bunch of mailboxes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have posted both the output of the cluster\\_info command and the app.config
&gt;&gt;&gt; from one of the nodes here:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; https://gist.github.com/996419
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would be very grateful if someone from Basho would take a look at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; cluster\\_info and see if they can spot anything obvious.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Each machine in the cluster has an 8-core Xeon and 16GB RAM.  I believe all
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the platform details, etc., are in the cluster\\_info dump.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many thanks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
