Malka,

the most likely reason is that the JavaScript file is not properly accessible 
to Riak on some of the nodes in your cluster.

Have you checked that the file is properly distributed throughout the cluster 
and js\\_source\\_dir is set accordingly, and Riak is restarted on all nodes?

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I have some modules with js functions for named MR.
&gt; But for some keys, I get the message that my module is undefined:
&gt; {"lineno":1,"message":"ReferenceError: GetTotal is not 
&gt; defined","source":"unknown"} 
&gt; If it's defined for some keys why it's not for the others (although they have 
&gt; same values)?
