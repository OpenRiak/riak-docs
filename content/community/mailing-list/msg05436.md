&gt; &gt; eventual consistency whereby some other node sees A and B but not the
&gt; &gt; cleanup key because it hasn't propagated yet, and therefore thinks the

&gt; If cluster-to-cluster replication is in play, there will be a problem

&gt; independent of the write order.

You're talking about a W + R &lt;= N case? I am not sure, but my proposal 
probably only works if causal consistency can be guaranteed (provided it works 
the way I think it does).
