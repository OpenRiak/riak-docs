I'd recommend to set up at least tree nodes even for the test environment.
I'm quite sure your n\\_val
has
default value=3.
That means riak stores three copies of all data on the same node, even if
you have only one node running. That causes a lot of i/o, you'll exceed
open files limit, etc.
Please correct me if I'm mistaken.

Cheers
Vladimir
