What about a forum? Right now the mailing list is mainly limited to
discussions that's pretty technical. A forum would allow newbies to ask
intro questions as well as putting up showcase and what not without getting
the whole mailing list covered.

(Forum is more casual, imo)

&gt; At this point Riak has been deployed thousands of times. This is
&gt; excellent, but as you can imagine we here at Basho feel this is just the
&gt; tip of the iceberg. We want everyone to be running Riak. The software
&gt; obviously needs to solve enough problems for people to want to deploy it.
&gt; However, we need to get the software into developers' hands before this
&gt; happens. So the question is:
&gt;
&gt; What can we be doing better?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not talking so much about features in Riak itself. I'm more interested
&gt; in the other resources, tools, docs, processes, etc., that you think we
&gt; need to put in place or refine to take the Riak community from 1000s of
&gt; users to 100,000s of users. By virtue of being on this list, you've all
&gt; spent some time using or investigating Riak. As such, you're opinions and
&gt; experiences would be very valuable.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments, ideas, or thoughts you had would be great. On or off-list
&gt; will work.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your time. Long live the vnode!
