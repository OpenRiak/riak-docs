Statebox ( https://github.com/mochi/statebox/ ) can help with
counters, though they will take a handful of space. There's also a
branch named "counters", but I'm not sure about its status.

Anyway, I totally agree that having native distributed counters would
be super awesome, no matter with using statebox or whatever.

Thumbs up!

&gt; Hello Registered Voters!
&gt; It's early stage election season and like all good election seasons you need
&gt; a candidate you can get behind. A candidate you want to have a beer with. A
&gt; candidate that can go all... the... way. And that is why today, I bring you
&gt; Distributed Counter. You may have heard about Distributed Counter around the
&gt; way but I am here to set the record straight.
&gt; I'm not gonna blow smoke in your general direction and say that Distributed
&gt; Counter will cure cancer and put money in your pocket. Nevertheless, if you
&gt; feel better and can take your sweetheart to the movies this weekend I'm not
&gt; gonna say that Distributed Counter was not responsible for that. Because
&gt; Distributed Counter may very well have been! Not only does Distributed
&gt; Counter have the right stuff when it comes to domestic issues large and
&gt; small but Distributed Counter groks foreign relations. Distributed Counter
&gt; is loved by our allies the world over. Especially in Europe. Also, Asia.
&gt; And so, without further ado I give you the opportunity to pull the lever for
&gt; Distributed Counter!

&gt; Top 10 Reasons Why You Want Distributed Counter In Your Riak:
&gt; 10. Bucket Deletion may be your front runner but anyone can loop over a key
&gt; list.
&gt; 9. It is a great feature add for Riak.
&gt; 8. You are OCD and you need to count everything. Twice.
&gt; 7. You have a large jar of jelly beans on your desk and you always wanted to
&gt; know how many were in there. You know this can help you... somehow.
&gt; 6. You know you want to.
&gt; 5. You wrote a background process android pedometer app but you don't trust
&gt; local storage :(
&gt; 4. It is one of the reasons you use Cassandra and would rather not.
&gt; 3. Redis has become a single point of failure for you.
&gt; 2. You think I'm awesome and if I had a bridge to sell you you would buy it.
&gt; 1. Those slackers at Basho have nothing better to do since they unleashed
&gt; secondary index.
