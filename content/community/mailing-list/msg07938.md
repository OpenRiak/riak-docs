I would like to store JSON documents in a Riak 1.1.x bucket (using bitcask), 
and would like to search for them via REST using JSON property values.

E.g. JSON docs with typed properties like this:

{
 "type": "whatever",
 "owner": 123456,
 "text": "Blah blah blah",
 "enabled": true
}

However, the query response (/solr/mybucket/select?q=enabled:true&wt=json) 
returns each doc's properties as JSON strings, and not the original JSON type:

{"responseHeader":{
 "status":0,
 "QTime":1,
 "params":{
 "q":"enabled:true",
 "q.op":"or",
 "filter":"",
 "wt":"json"
 }
},"response":{
 "numFound":1,
 "start":0,
 "maxScore":"0.353553",
 "docs":[
 {
 "id":"Obdoy3XbJe3kdh1T2bfxJgISCCL",
 "index":"rest",
 "fields":{
 "enabled": "true",
 "owner": "123456",
 "text": "Blah blah blah",
 "type": "whatever"
 },
 "props":{}
 }
 ]
}}


This makes the results unusable for me, and I'm concerned I'd have to fall back 
to N calls back to retrieve each original doc, which is not feasible.


I'm used to CouchDB+Lucene which behaves "correctly" to me.

Is there some way to do what I'd like? E.g. another query method or option?

Thanks
