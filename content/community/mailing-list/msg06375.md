Hi,

I've recently been discussing the possibility of working on a gora-riak
store for the Apache Gora project [1]. As gora is written in Java we would
use the riak-javascript-client API for the Riak logic, the aim being to
provide all the goodies that Gora offers to the Riak community...

Would something of this nature be a valuable asset?
