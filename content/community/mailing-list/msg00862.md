Hi Mark,

The option "default\\_gossip\\_seed" is not a Riak option; at least not one I
have seen. You are correct that it does not appear in the Riak source code.
If this was an option it has been removed.

To form a Riak cluster you must tell a node about another node in the
cluster using the "riak-admin join" command. A node only needs to be told
about one other node in a cluster; Riak learns about other cluster nodes via
gossip.The seeding process would look as follows:
riak start
riak-admin join ot...@node


Currently, removing a node must be done via Erlang. Bug 571 has been filed
to request a "remove" command:
https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=571

Removing a node via Erlang:
1. Attach to a riak node
riak attach

2. Get a local client
{ok, C} = riak:local\\_client().

3. Remove the node
C:remove\\_from\\_cluster('n...@host').

4 Detach from the node using CTRL+D
^D


Thanks,
Dan

&gt; I'm playing around with setting up and tearing down clusters and I had
&gt; a few questions:
&gt;
&gt; Looking at the chef recipe for riak sets an option in riak\\_core
&gt; 'default\\_gossip\\_seed'; apparently this is intended to cue a newly spun
&gt; up node where to look to join the cluster. But for the life of me I
&gt; can't get it to work, and I can't find any mention of it in the
&gt; source.
&gt; What's the recommended way to seed a freshly spun up node with a seed
&gt; machine?
&gt;
&gt; I'm also trying to figure out how to evict a node from the ring. If
&gt; you have access to the machine, you can do 'riak-admin leave' but what
&gt; can you do if you don't? I'm imagining a usage pattern where you are
&gt; running a bunch of vhosted machines. One dies, and you spin up a new
&gt; machine, with a new node name to replace it. How do you get that old
&gt; machine out of the ring?
&gt;
&gt; The natural way to name nodes in ec2 is to do something like
&gt; r...@ec2\\_internal\\_ip. But once an instance is terminated, there is no
&gt; way to get that ip back. I suspect I'm doing things wrong here, so
&gt; suggestions for better configuration patterns are very welcome.
