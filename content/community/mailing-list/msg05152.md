Thanks for the mail, though I thought I was using the latest client. The
client\\_lib/README file points to https://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-python-client
and from there I ran the suggested command 
(hg clone https://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-python-client) 
to get the code. 

However, I found at least part of the problem, though I still don't quite
understand the root cause. In my riak-1.0.0 build directory, 
./deps/protobuffs/ebin/protobuffs.beam is 12692 and includes the string
next\\_field\\_num. However, ./rel/riak/lib/protobuffs-0/ebin/protobuffs.beam
is only 7536 and does not include that string. It appears that
the "rel" version is being built without the full protobuf code.

When I run the server using the larger "deps" version, my test client works.

&gt; It looks like you're using version 1.2.2 of the client. I suggest trying
&gt; 1.3.0 or the master branch from github.

&gt; &gt; Trying to upgrade from 0.14.1 to 1.0.0...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This python program works with 0.14.1:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ====================================================================
&gt; &gt; import riak
&gt; &gt; client = riak.RiakClient(port=XXXX, host="YYYY.ZZZZ",
&gt; &gt; transport\\_class=riak.RiakPbcTransport)
&gt; &gt; test\\_bucket = client.bucket('test')
&gt; &gt; x=test\\_bucket.new('0-0-0','hello6')
&gt; &gt; x.store()
&gt; &gt; ====================================================================
&gt; &gt; However, with the server running 1.0.0, I get:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ====================================================================
&gt; &gt; Traceback (most recent call last):
&gt; &gt; File "./bench/client.py", line 6, in

&gt; &gt; format(nmsglen))
&gt; &gt; riak.RiakError: 'Socket returned short packet length - expected 4'
&gt; &gt; ====================================================================
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When this happens, console.logg gets:
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Both 0.14.1 and 1.0.0 work with the HTTP interface, but I want to use
&gt; &gt; the PB interface.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suspect I'm just missing something simple, but I haven't been puzzling
&gt; &gt; over this for some time and haven't been able to find anything yet!
