Hi Peter,

Thanks for the email re: PBS -- it's quite interesting stuff.

&gt; Thus far, in addition to general Dynamo-style replication analysis, we've

&gt; and are interested in potentially working to integrate PBS analysis into
&gt; additional data stores like Riak, which can also benefit from PBS analysis

Can you describe the class of changes you had to make to Cassandra to
gather the information? We already track a fair bit of latency
information across percentiles -- are there any other inputs you need?

Thanks,

D.
