Hi,

I am using riak control now. I just booted up 5 nodes with no data. I use chef 
to boot up the cluster and when booted I ssh into the machine and run 
riak-admin cluster join riak@111.111.111.111 where 111.111.111.111 is a 
randomly chosen ip address in the group.

I go to riak control and this is what I get.

1) I see two green lights
2) On of the green lights has 100% of the partitions
3) The other three have a status of joining.

I waited and waited, and tried riak control on other machines. Same story.

How do I resolve?

Thanks
