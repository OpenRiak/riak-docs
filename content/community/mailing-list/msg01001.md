Hi Carlos,

Actually, we are doing just that for sorted indexes. We have small indexes
in an index bucket, where the key is a related to our user, and the value is
the binary tree of sorted entries. We do this because there are a lot of
users, but the trees will never be very large. I don't have any performance
results on how fast that is compared to other methods yet though, but there
are methods built in to do sorting and slicing. Look at
http://hg.basho.com/riak\\_kv/src/tip/priv/mapred\\_builtins.js for the
reduceSort and reduceSlice functions and in
http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak\\_kv/src/tip/src/riak\\_kv\\_mapreduce.erl.
