Generally when the node doesn't crash and the rest of normal operations are
still working, you don't have to worry. Note that the bug you mention has
been fixed and will be available in 1.0 when released. I understand there
will be some preview-release packages you will be able to try for several
weeks before the final release is out.

&gt; Hi Sean,
&gt;
&gt; I have the same issue as mentioned here :
&gt; http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\\_lists.basho.com/2011-June/004639.html
&gt; It happens few time every day, the node doesn't crash, I'm not sure if I
&gt; have to be worried about this or not.
&gt;
&gt; I have plenty of memory available on this server.
&gt;
&gt; Here's the output of erlang.log
&gt; I'm having difficulty to decipher this stack trace.... any howto available
&gt; ? :)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
