I am using a (protobuf) client library to connect to my RIAK cluster, however I 
am at a loss as to how to make the right connection. All of the client examples 
only specify one node to connect to. My question is, what happens if the ONE 
node specified for the connection happens to be down? Am I missing something? 
Any clarification is appreciated.
