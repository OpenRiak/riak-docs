Sorry for being dismissive, I do understand what you're after. I'm just saying 
that if your application needs those semantics, build them in -- don't expect 
Riak's vector clocks to do the work for you. Keep a list of the most recent 
"change" events either in that object or alongside, or keep a copy of the 
last-seen version in your object -- whatever works to make those kinds of 
merges possible.

Interestingly, multiple people have explored the SCM-on-top-of-Riak thing, so I 
know it's doable; the key difference there is that multiple, independently 
written objects are used to represent the history of a single conceptual 
"object". Once written, nothing is overwritten, only new objects are created.

&gt; I'm not missing the point you think I am. Riak already has the
&gt; ability to store more than one value for a key/value pair. I'd like
&gt; an option - possibly named something new, that used this to store a
&gt; limited amount of history so that clients could be presented with a
&gt; common ancestor when that was required.
&gt; 
&gt; In the case that I gave you, if the common ancestor is:
&gt; 
&gt; {
&gt; "name": "Jane Doe",
&gt; "occupation": "secretary"
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; then a standard three-way merge would say that she got married and the
&gt; correct result should be:
&gt; 
&gt; {
&gt; "name": "Jane Blow",
&gt; "husband": "Joe Blow",
&gt; "occupation": "n/a"
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; while if the common ancestor is:
&gt; 
&gt; {
&gt; "name": "Jane Blow",
&gt; "husband": "Joe Blow",
&gt; "occupation": "n/a"
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; then a standard 3-way merge would say that she dumped the jerk and got
&gt; a job resulting in:
&gt; 
&gt; {
&gt; "name": "Jane Doe",
&gt; "occupation": "secretary"
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; Without the common ancestor you know what changed, but not which
&gt; direction the changes are going, and so have no sane way to resolve
&gt; the conflict.
&gt; 
&gt; Given the non-atomic nature of reads and writes in Riak, it is likely
&gt; that neither of the two clients that wrote that data was in any way
&gt; aware of the existence of the other write. This makes your suggestion
&gt; of escalating to the user impossible. And there is no particular
&gt; reason to believe that the third user to come along will necessarily
&gt; know anything either.
&gt; 
&gt; (Besides, I spent enough years maintaining batch systems to be wary of
&gt; escalating to users at the drop of a hat. The "user" may well be a
&gt; complete moron on autopilot.)

&gt;&gt; I think you're missing a key point here, and that is that the vector clock

&gt;&gt; to give you if you don't have the value. Vector clocks are essentially 
&gt;&gt; opaque to clients.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; That said, I think the use-case you gave is one that can clearly bubble up 
&gt;&gt; to the user, e.g. "Someone else changed this record while you were editing 
&gt;&gt; it. Can you resolve the differences?" (Give the other person's name perhaps, 
&gt;&gt; highlight the fields that are different.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Riak's small\\_vclock, big\\_vclock, young\\_vclock, and old\\_vclock
&gt;&gt;&gt; parameters already give control over pruning behavior. If there isn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; enough history to compute a common ancestor, then return nothing for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the common ancestor.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; The use case here really isn't an SCM. The use case is when two
&gt;&gt;&gt; clients get simultaneous (within, say, 50 ms) requests to write to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same object. When a third one tries to read the data 5s later, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be nice to have a way to figure out what to do. For this use
&gt;&gt;&gt; case you can limit the amount of history quite severely without loss.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's take a practical example of conflicting data structures:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; {
&gt;&gt;&gt; "name": "Jane Doe",
&gt;&gt;&gt; "occupation": "n/a"
&gt;&gt;&gt; },
&gt;&gt;&gt; {
&gt;&gt;&gt; "name": "Jane Blow",
&gt;&gt;&gt; "husband": "Joe Blow",
&gt;&gt;&gt; "occupation": "secretary"
&gt;&gt;&gt; }
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; What should it be resolved to? Perhaps Jane just got divorced and
&gt;&gt;&gt; went to work as a secretary. Or she could have gotten married and
&gt;&gt;&gt; left her job. If you give me the common ancestor I can tell which
&gt;&gt;&gt; scenario to believe. Without it I can only guess badly. I don't want
&gt;&gt;&gt; to keep a history here. I want to resolve the discrepancy the next
&gt;&gt;&gt; time I see it (and log it somewhere important if I can't resolve it).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but vector clocks are for resolution of race-conditions and network 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; partitions, not to provide an SCM history. Imagine how much space would 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be consumed by the history long enough to disambiguate an object that has 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been updated normally 1000 times, followed by one bad client that decides 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write to it without fetching the vector clock first.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Coda Hale put it well in his talk at the recent Riak Meetup: your data 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; needs to be logically monotonic so that writes (and reads) can be retried 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; until resolution is reached.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, we've found that assigning the client id to something that is 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relevant to your domain, e.g. real people, will help reduce surprises (and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; degenerate cases like sibling explosion) when it comes to vector-clock 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resolution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I actually had a question about that page. Why is it that when there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a conflict we can only get the conflicting versions of the data?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I'm going to try to resolve the conflict intelligently, I really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want the common ancestor as well so that I can try to do a 3-way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; merge.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good call. If an ancestor were available it would make counting and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; merging orthogonal changes \\*much\\* simpler.
