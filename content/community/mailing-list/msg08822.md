Im looking for explanation what exactly r, pr, w, dw, pw, rw stands for.

Im sorry if this was already posted but I cannot find anything on
that. I tried wiki.basho.com/Riak-Glossary.html,
http://wiki.basho.com/HTTP-API.html#Bucket-Operations,
http://wiki.basho.com/Buckets.html but it only describes N, R, W.

do I understand correctly that W property is only considered when
updating value and for first store N value is used? or is it:
replicate data N times but return success if it was persisted to W
vnodes.
if DW is durable write then what W really means? can I get successful
response after write operation without object being persisted to
durable storage??

I must admit Im quite confused here.

And second question, If I set r, pr, w, dw, pw, rw in app.config for
every configured node in cluster those values will not be added to
gossiped information, right?

pozdrawiam
