Hey Matthew,

Sorry for the delayed response.

What are the specs of the hardware are you're running on? How much data do
you have in your five nodes?

&gt;&gt; Hi Basho,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We have a running cluster of 5 nodes which accidentally was configured
&gt;&gt; with a default setting
&gt;&gt; "{ ring\\_creation\\_size: 64 }".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As suggested in documentation we cannot scale this cluster more than 6
&gt;&gt; machines,
&gt;&gt; so the only option is to migrate to a new cluster with a
&gt;&gt; larger ring\\_creation\\_size value.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What is the best way to perform the migration?! And btw why 64 is still
&gt;&gt; the default value?!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; -Matthew
