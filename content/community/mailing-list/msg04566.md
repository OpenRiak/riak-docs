Hi Giancarlo,
I really appreciate the contribution, but this code has been in master since 
20th July 2011[1][2]

Are you working from an older commit? If so I really recommend you work from 
the latest master since the development of the client continues towards a v1.0 
release soon.

If you find any other omissions or bugs then I'd be grateful if you submit 
patches using github's pull request feature.

Thanks again,

Russell

&gt; Hi developers,

&gt; This is a simple patch for retrieving contentType on RiakObject. Maybe it's 
&gt; useful.
