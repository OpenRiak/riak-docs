It's a good start, thanks. One particular case of conditional PUT that I
would find very useful is "put only if this bucket/key does not already
exist", which I can achieve using HTTP via "If-None-Match: \\*", and now via
the new if\\_none\\_match on RpbPutReq. It seems weird to transplant the
relevant HTTP header names to the protobuf specifications of RpbPutReq and
RpbGetReq, though, as those names make no sense outside of a HTTP context,
and they don't mirror the HTTP semantics anyway. If if\\_none\\_match was
if\\_missing, for instance, that would reduce the cognitive dissonance.
