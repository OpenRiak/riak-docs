A node won't adapt its settings when it joins the cluster. It is recommended to 
have the same settings for options like the storage\\_backend as well as any 
specific settings for the backend (such as in the case of Innostore) to provide 
consistency across the cluster, but settings like "riak\\_wep\\_ip" will differ 
between nodes.
