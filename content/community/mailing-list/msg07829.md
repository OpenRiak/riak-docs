Hi Andrew,

Those were added to be part of the 1.2 release, which is in testing/QA
phases now. You can expect the release sometime next month. If you intend
to use the .proto files in your client application, be aware that they may
not be supported on the server yet (in fact, 1.1 and earlier will likely
dump the connection).
