Hi,

Can some one please help me in setting up RIAK. I am getting the below 
error at start up.

And we used " riak-1.2.0-1.el5.x86\\_64.rpm" latest rpm to setup the riak.

[BL]# riak start
Attempting to restart script through sudo -H -u riak
pthread/ethr\\_event.c:98: Fatal error in wait\\_\\_(): Function not 
implemented (38)
pthread/ethr\\_event.c:98: Fatal error in wait\\_\\_(): Function not 
implemented (38)

Error reading /etc/riak/app.config

Thanks in advance.
