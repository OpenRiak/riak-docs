The `badfun` is a new error. That wasn't in your original email. I'm not
sure why you are seeing that. Are all your Riak nodes using 1.2.0-rc1?
 Can you give me more information on your cluster setup? Are there any
other errors in you logs? The more information the more I can help.

The repair "command" is not actually available from the command line yet.
 You need to attach to the Riak console to access it. The APIs are
`riak\\_kv\\_vnode:repair(PartitionNumber)` and
`riak\\_search\\_vnode:repair(PartitionNumber)`.

&gt; Ryan,
&gt; Increasing "ulimit -n" (current value is 4096, I have tested from 1024 to
&gt; 200000) does not change anything, always the same errors :
&gt; {timeout,range\\_loop}
&gt; lookup/range failure:
&gt; {{badfun,#Fun},[{mi\\_server,iterate,6},{mi\\_server,lookup,8}]}
&gt;
&gt; I cannot find the command "repair" that you talk about in your email (on
&gt; riak1.2.0-rc1), is it a function directly in an erlang module and not
&gt; accessible yet with riak-admin ?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Arnaud,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The 'stream\\_timeout' and 'emfile' should be correlated. Whenever you see
&gt;&gt; the 'emfile' you should see a corresponding timeout. The index server
&gt;&gt; errors causing the result collector to timeout later. First, adjust your
&gt;&gt; file descriptor limit and then go from there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For the 1.2 release a "repair" command has been added to rebuild KV or
&gt;&gt; index data for a given partition. In releases before that you must reindex
&gt;&gt; all your data. You don't have to worry about removing the current indexes
&gt;&gt; as merge index will garbage collect that for you as it merges. As I said,
&gt;&gt; first I would fix the 'emfile' issue and then see if further action is
&gt;&gt; needed.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; -Z
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; P.S. If you want to be absolutely sure what your FD limit is in Riak you
&gt;&gt; can `riak attach` and then `os:cmd("ulimit -n").` Make sure to use Ctrl-D
&gt;&gt; to exit from the Riak shell.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Friday evening one of our riak node has reach his disk space limit
&gt;&gt;&gt; during indexing in riak-search. Then after adding some nodes, some requests
&gt;&gt;&gt; fail, and it is impossible to find the correlation between requests with
&gt;&gt;&gt; error or those who succeed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The errors are :
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; {{nocatch,stream\\_timeout},[{riak\\_search\\_op\\_utils,gather\\_stream\\_results,4}]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; {timeout,range\\_loop}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; and sometimes (not always) :
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; {{badmatch,{error,emfile}},[{mi\\_segment,iterate\\_by\\_keyinfo,7},{mi\\_server,'-lookup/8-lc$^1/1-1-',4},{mi\\_server,'-lookup/8-lc$^1/1-1-',4},{mi\\_server,lookup,8}]}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; So anyone else has experienced these errors ? Is it possible that they
&gt;&gt;&gt; come from the disk over limit error ? How can I try to repair merge index
&gt;&gt;&gt; data ? If it is not possible, what is the good process to delete entirely
&gt;&gt;&gt; all the indexes (only indexes, keeping riak datas).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards.
