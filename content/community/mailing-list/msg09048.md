Thanks,

That worked, though not performing as fast as I'd like.

&gt;&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm after some newbie help with ripple. I've created secondary indexes on
&gt;&gt; a property in my document class and have confirmed that I can query the
&gt;&gt; index via the browser. I've also confirmed the indexes are there as 
&gt;&gt; Ripple.client.get\\_index("test\\_riak\\_data",
&gt;&gt; "type\\_bin", "foo") works and returns the keys of the documents.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My document class is extremely simple:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; module Test::Riak
&gt;&gt; class Data
&gt;&gt; include Ripple::Document
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; property :type, String
&gt;&gt; index :type, String
&gt;&gt; end
&gt;&gt; end
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; However, when I try Test::Riak::Data.find\\_by\\_index(:type, "foo") I get
&gt;&gt; an ArgumentError: No index has been defined for property 'type' of type
&gt;&gt; 'Test::Riak::Data'.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm probably doing something wrong but I'm not sure what. Any help would
&gt;&gt; be appreciated.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Chris
