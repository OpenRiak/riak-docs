Actually meant to reply earlier, but got side tracked. I'll look deeper
into it, but I think it may have been an artifact of the testing warming up
the cache, and then the wildcard searches responding more quickly. I
looked at the source, and saw the a wildcard is simply transforms to a
range query, which makes sense. Might need to add more notes to our
cluster to get the performance we need in EC2.
