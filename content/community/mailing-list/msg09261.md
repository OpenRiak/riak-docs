This is well-documented in our docs [0]. Please note that this is
\\*not\\* recommended for production use (as the page states). I took a
quick look at the CorrugatedIron docs [1] and didn't find any details
on how to do this which means that either a) I missed it or b) OJ and
Jeremiah saved you a lot of production pain by not implementing it. :)
