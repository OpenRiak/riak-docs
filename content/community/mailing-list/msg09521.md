What about the other paths? 

 {platform\\_bin\\_dir, "/usr/sbin"},
 {platform\\_data\\_dir, "/mnt/datadrive/riak/data"},
 {platform\\_etc\\_dir, "/etc/riak"},
 {platform\\_lib\\_dir, "/usr/lib64/riak/lib"},
 {platform\\_log\\_dir, "/mnt/datadrive/riak"}

If I change the log directory what log files does it affect? Is this the
right place to change the data directory (where the database is persisted)?
Do I have to worry about other configuration settings once I change these?
Thank you.

Look under 'lager' in app.config for the logfile paths.
