@jeff -- both the pre-packaged binary from basho.com and the version
installed by brew exhibited identical behavior.

That said, I did run into a few issues with the brew installer for riak on
my "old" Macbook Pro, which seemed be fixed by installing HEAD erlang +
HEAD riak (living on the edge!).

@mark -- It's ummm... "magical" and "resolutionary" [?]
Seriously though, the things I'm most appreciative of is the 16GB RAM +
250GB SSD. The display is just bonus. ;)

&gt; Ages ago, .4x time, I started out using brew and had issues so I switched
&gt; to pulling from github. May be worth a try.
