 Greetings all! I'm a riak newbie, trying to figure out the details of
setting up a cluster in my environment.

We have machines in different data centers and no VPN between them. I'm
a little confused by the details of the required ports, and would love
to see a concrete example from someone who has a setup that uses ssh to
tunnel between nodes in a riak cluster.

Jeremy
