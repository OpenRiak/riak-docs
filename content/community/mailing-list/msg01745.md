Hey Ripple users,

An awesome new feature is coming in Riak 0.14 (and already available on master) 
that lets you filter keys in a MapReduce job before feeding them to the query 
phases. Kevin Smith detailed their purpose and how to use them in this 
presentation from the October Riak meetup in SF: 
http://www.slideshare.net/hemulen/riak-mapred-preso

I'd like to support them in riak-client by the time 0.14 is released, so I'd 
appreciate your feedback on how the syntax should look/feel. I've created a 
gist with some possibilities below, and I'm open to other suggestions as well. 
Please comment!
