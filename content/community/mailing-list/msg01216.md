Riak Recap for Oct 4-5

1) Looks like Franck Cuny and the awesome team at Linkfluence pushed
out the 0.9 version of their Perl driver "Net-Riak."

Latest code here ---&gt; http://search.cpan.org/~franckc/Net-Riak-0.09/
Changes here ---&gt; http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/FRANCKC/Net-Riak-0.09/LICENSE

2) michei, seancribbs and bingledac had a brief convo in #riak that
started with "With riak's map/reduce, does that emit results over the
network as they are found?"

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/613702

3) Q --- Are there are any speed tests (r/w ops sec with x clients),
for bitcask? (from hazmat via #riak)

 A --- http://bitbucket.org/basho/basho\\_bench . Make sure to bench
it on your target platform.

4) kagato, drev1, benblack and and moonpolysoft had a lengthy
conversation in #riak that started with "Knock, knock. Can somebody
give me a primer on ring\\_creation\\_size?"

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/613725

5) grantr, benblack and jdmaturen had a chat in #riak about
implementing a queue with Riak.

6) Rusty Klophaus (@rklophaus) gave a presentation at the CUFP
conference last week in Baltimore. There was a tidy little write up of
it here on the Functional-Orbiz Blog.
