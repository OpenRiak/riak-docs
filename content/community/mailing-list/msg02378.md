We use the java client, mostly in groovy. In terms of wish list

1: Protocol buffer support, this is addressed in the 0.14 version.

2: make the httpconnection max client setting work. I couldn't get this to work
no matter what I do. It always only open 1 connection.

3: support no-data flag. I noticed in python client, you can pass a
no-data returned
flag when doing a PUT to riak. I can't find the same thing in java.
This would be
very useful in bulk upload situation.

4: it'd be nice if we can write map/reduce functions in groovy. :)

&gt; Short answer -- we're working on it and would love your input. :)
