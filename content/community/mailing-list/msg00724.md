I doubt it. Nothing in riak is guaranteed to be ordered, afaik. Best bet is 
when using allow\\_mult=true, enabling siblings in buckets, is to order the multi 
response by last modified date in your application.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; We're trying to sort out a conflict resolution strategy and are
&gt; wondering if we can rely on the order of the conflicted values in a
&gt; document for it. So for example, for a given document we might end up
&gt; with the values:
&gt; 
&gt; [ "Wednesday", "Tuesday", "Thursday" ]
&gt; 
&gt; From doing a little testing, the last value in a multipart document is
&gt; the first, so "Thursday" in this case, can we assume that this will
&gt; always be the case? And is it a good idea to base conflict resolution
&gt; on this?
