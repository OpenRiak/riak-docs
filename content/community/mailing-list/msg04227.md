This is just me theorizing, so someone can feel free to correct me:

Riak KV isn't good for time series databases because writes are random; there's 
no sequential access order.

Secondary indices in all databases increase query performance because there is 
a predictable order and structure making it quick to look up data. If Riak were 
using some kind of monolithic (non-distributed) index I could see this feature 
as being useful for time series applications.

However, since it looks like secondary indices are data local (See slide 53 
http://www.slideshare.net/rklophaus/querying-riak-just-got-easier-introducing-secondary-indices),
 you'll still run into many of the same issues of non-data locality that you 
would run into trying to perform a MapReduce operation to only query 10% of 
your data - even with key filters you still have to scan all keys in memory.

TL;DR - indexes are hard, let's go shopping.

&gt;&gt; So, here is what we generally caution \\*against\\* using Riak for:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1) It's not a graph database
&gt;&gt; 2) Time Series apps (it's doable but not optimal)
&gt;&gt; 2) Stuff that is analytics-heavy or requires a lot of adhoc queries.
&gt; 
&gt; Will the upcoming index support make it suitable for time series data with 
&gt; range queries?
