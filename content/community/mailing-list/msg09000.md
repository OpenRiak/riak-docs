Hi Felix,

Riak Search uses the same interface/port as the normal Riak HTTP
operations, so look in your app.config file for the {http, [ ... ]}
line to find the host/port combination. There's no UI exported from
that interface, but you should be able to use Solr-like URLs to
perform queries and modify the indexes.

&gt; I’ve searched around on the web for this but am coming up short. How do I
&gt; turn on the web-based search interface which is documented here?
&gt; (http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/Riak-Search---Settings/#Default
&gt; Ports)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Using “netstat -a | grep 8098” I can see that there’s definitely nothing
&gt; listening on that port.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I do have search enabled in app.config for each of my four nodes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
