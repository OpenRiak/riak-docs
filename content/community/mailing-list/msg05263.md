2011/10/24 shared mailinglists :
&gt; During the run, I use iptables to simulate a network partition in which one
&gt; node in the cluster is disconnected from the other four (but all five remain
&gt; connected to the client). To disconnect from node A, for example, I run:
&gt;
&gt; sudo /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s  -j REJECT
&gt; sudo /sbin/iptables -A OUTPUT -d  -j REJECT

This will not simulate a network partition. It will simulate Riak not
running on the given node. REJECT means a response is "sent back" to
the requestor, saying that the connection was rejected. Using DROP as
your target would more closely mimick a network partition as any
attempts to contact the node in question will be met with silence.
