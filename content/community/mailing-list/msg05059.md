I was reading through this documentation after a colleague mentioned
getting not\\_found while stopping and starting nodes to mimic failures.
 His experience corresponds with the behaviors described on this wiki
page:

http://wiki.basho.com/Eventual-Consistency.html#Failure-Scenarios

However, when I try to mimic the same failures in 1.0, I get successes
when trying to read and write after taking a node down. I noticed the
notfound\\_ok parameter exists now in the HTTP documentation which I
assume has something to do with this. Has the fail-over code been
improved to hide the not\\_found responses in the face of failure?

Thanks,
Eric Moritz.
