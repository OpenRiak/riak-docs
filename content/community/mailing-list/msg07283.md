&gt; In order to do paging, you really need a way to grab a set number of 
&gt; items in order. For example, give me the first 25 documents that match 
&gt; this secondary index. Or give me 25 documents starting at document 50 in 
&gt; the ordered list.
&gt; 
&gt; Today, we're working around this by grabbing all of the items and doing 
&gt; the paging client side (in javascript). That obviously won't scale past 
&gt; a few hundred items, however.


For best performance and scalability, think different about paging.
Most of the times, a paging method without a specific count of items will suit 
a Riak architecture better.

It's easy to implement paging through endless scrolling (like Facebook or 
Twitter) without limiting your MapReduce jobs (which is quite slow):
- Use timestamps as secondary indexes and do range queries on a specific time 
frame and sort those values.

If you really need to implement paging in the traditional way, just use 
something like Redis to keep a sorted list of your keys.
