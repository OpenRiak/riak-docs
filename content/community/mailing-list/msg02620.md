Hi Saurabh,

The protocols buffers interface does not currently support server side
generated keys. Bug 485 has been filed for this issue:
https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=485

In the mean time you can generate a unique key on the client side. You can
use the code on the server side as a reference for generating unique keys:
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_core/blob/master/src/riak\\_core\\_util.erl#L131

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I was going through riak's documentation and I saw that through the rest
&gt; API, if a key for an object is not specified, riak generates one for you.
&gt; Can I do the same when storing objects through the riak erlang pb
&gt; client programmatically ?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt;
