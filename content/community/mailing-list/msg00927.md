I used different Key for C:get but the same mapred is invoked with the
BucketKey I passed at start. I also checked value count for that BK is
1. riak\\_object:value\\_count(RObj).

&gt; I have a riak mapred function which calls {ok, C} = riak:local\\_client and
&gt; then C:get (B,K) which is of different key than the incoming one,
&gt; however I noticed that same mapred is called whenever there is C:get (I
&gt; have 2 gets and 2 times mapred is called), I checked by removing C:get then
&gt; things worked as expected. Is that of correct behavior?
