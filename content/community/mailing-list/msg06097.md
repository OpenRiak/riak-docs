Thank you Mark : )

BTW
&gt; &gt; Set bucket:
&gt; &gt; curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \\
&gt; &gt; '{"props":{"n\\_val":5}}' http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; curl -v -d 'this is a test' -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \\
&gt; http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test/keys

This is needed instead:
curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \\
'{"props":{"n\\_val":5}}' http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test/props

&gt; Also, quite excited to see lisp bindings. :)
I noticed yesterday that you guys already list the bindings I made (and
am updating):
http://wiki.basho.com/Community-Developed-Libraries-and-Projects.html
Mine are the Racket (which is a lisp dialect) ones. 

Thanks,
Jordan

&gt; &gt; I am working on bindings for the HTTP API for lisp, the docs list new and
&gt; &gt; old URLs for requests, but it appears that not all of the new URLs are
&gt; &gt; implemented yet? I am using 1.0.2 is there a planned release number for
&gt; &gt; supporting all of the new URL formats?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Looks like you've caught an error in the wiki. The new URL formats are
&gt; supported, but we neglected to provide the full URL in the docs. You
&gt; are missing a "/keys" from the end of those URLs. The URLs in line
&gt; below should work for you.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll push a fix to the wiki today if I have a few minutes. Sorry for
&gt; the confusion. Also, quite excited to see lisp bindings. :)

&gt; &gt; These don't seem to be working with the new URL format:
