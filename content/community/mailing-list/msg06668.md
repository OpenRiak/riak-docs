We at Braintree (http://www.braintreepayments.com/) open sourced our 
Riak ORM for Ruby called Curator. It follows a repository pattern rather 
than an ActiveRecord or Ripple pattern.


You can check out the code on github:
https://github.com/braintree/curator

We also released a blog post that explains our pattern:

Comments welcome.

Thanks,
Paul
