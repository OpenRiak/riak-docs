I would like to use bucket names to determine default bucket props
such as hooks. For example, if all buckets matching foo\\* should have a
certain post-commit hook, I don't want to have to set those bucket
props before I can put keys in the buckets.

My preferred solution would be a config option that takes a mod/fun
instead of a proplist.

In riak\\_core\\_bucket, instead of always treating
app\\_helper:get\\_env(riak\\_core, default\\_bucket\\_props) as a list it would
also look for a tuple {M, F} and in that case call M:F(Name) which
would return a list.

Sound crazy? :)
