Hi Mike...

No, this is a red herring (on Redhat, haha). The mismatch is a result
of the Erlang build we currently have on the Fedora buildslave not
complying with some packaging requirements in Fedora. We are actively
working on addressing this, but in the interim I've uploaded a manual
build on Fedora 13:

http://downloads.basho.com/riak/CURRENT/riak-0.14.0-1.fc13.x86\\_64.rpm

I'm not sure if that works with Fedora 12 -- if it doesn't let me know
and I'll spin up a Fedora 12 system and try again. :)

Thanks!

D.
