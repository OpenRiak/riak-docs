Hi Jeremy,

You are correct; the remove\\_links function was not removing links correctly.
A fix has been pushed.

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; I was taking a look at wriaki and noticed a potential bug. In wobj.erl the
&gt; remove\\_links/3 function looks like it supposed to remove the links from the
&gt; object that match the Bucket and Tag. It does the opposite though, it keeps
&gt; only the links matching the Bucket and Tag (as per the logic in the
&gt; link\\_filter/2 function). Is this a bug or am I misreading this function's
&gt; intent?
