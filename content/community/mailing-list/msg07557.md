&gt; It'll be interesting if you can write a filesystem on top of Riak.

&gt; That would be a cool project to see on github :P

&gt;&gt; Hello Everybody!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have read abundantly over the web that Riak is very well suited to
&gt;&gt; store and retrieve small binary objects such as images, docs, etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In our scenario we are planning to use Riak to store uploads to our
&gt;&gt; portal which is a Social Network. Uploads are mostly images with maximum
&gt;&gt; size of 2 MB and typical size ranges between few KBs to few 100 KBs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does this usage pattern fit Riak? What are the caveats if any?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thank you!
&gt;
