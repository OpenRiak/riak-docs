Hi,
I have some questions about Riak Search.

I stored just one entry to RS: http://pastebin.com/2b5tybD1

My bucket has following schema: http://pastebin.com/dtnM3diL

1. I need to get all objects where "storylink": "
http://www.toolboxrecords.com/fr/product/12834/dubstep-grime-ukg/ruff-11/"
When I try to get it by query -
http://localhost:8098/solr/myfeed13/select?wt=json&q=storylink:"http://www.toolboxrecords.com/fr/product/12834/dubstep-grime-ukg/ruff-11/"
, I get nothing.
When I try to make query
http://localhost:8098/solr/myfeed13/select?wt=json&q=storylink:"\\*www.toolboxrecords.com\\*"
, all works correctly and I get content.
Could you please describe how can I get content through first query?

2. I get my object by query
http://localhost:8098/solr/myfeed13/select?wt=json&q=knownentities\\_type:"Country"
or
http://localhost:8098/solr/myfeed13/select?wt=json&q=knownentities\\_relevance:"0.914286
"
But I can't get they by
http://localhost:8098/solr/myfeed13/select?wt=json&q=knownentities\\_count:
"1"
or http://localhost:8098/solr/myfeed13/select?wt=json&q=knownentities\\_text:
"UK"

Why does it happen? However, all these fields are described similar in
schema.

3. I try to get my entry -
http://localhost:8098/solr/myfeed13/select?wt=json&q=categoryscores\\_business:"0.\\*
"
But result is nothing.

As you can see "business" is nested field for "categoryscores" field.
How can I get this entry?
