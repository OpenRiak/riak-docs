Hi,

Does the bucket name have any affect on the list-keys process?

Assuming I wish to store user information for some 200M users, and create a 
bucket per user. Each user bucket will contain several dozen objects.
- Will list-keys on such a user bucket be a reasonable action?
- Is list-keys isolated to a bucket?
- Is it reasonable to expect Riak to hold 200M buckets?

Kind regards,
Izhar.
