Hi All,

We've been spending a lot of time trying to prioritize work on our
client libraries. Some of our client code needs non-trivial
enhancements and because of that we are increasing work in most areas.
One client library we've been debating spending less time on is the
Riak JavaScript client [1].

As should be apparent from the commit log on the repo, we haven't made
any changes to the client since March of this year. Based on the lack
of squawking we've heard from the community about this client being
out-of-date, it doesn't look like too many of you are using this in
production. If you are, it's likely you've written some code to
augment the client.

The current plan is to make a final commit to the Repo and update the
README to reflect that Basho is no longer going to support the
JavaScript client. The final commit will remove all files except the
README. This is to discourage people from using it, but source will
obviously still be available via older revisions.

If anyone is opposed to Basho removing our stamp from the client,
please tell me. As I said above, due to the lack of activity from the
community related to this client, we don't suspect too many people
will be opposed. I could be wrong.

Thanks,

Mark
