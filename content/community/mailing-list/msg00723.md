Hello, Misha.

It is not really a good idea to base conflict resolution on the order
that Riak presents the siblings. While in simple cases you may see
predictable behavior, there is no guarantee of determinism in the
order they'll be stored in.

I suggest instead that if you need an interesting conflict resolution
strategy, you might do well to store the information needed for that
strategy explicitly in the object along with the content.

I hope that this helps. Please do ask more if this doesn't clear it up for you.
