I just put out a post on using map/reduce to sort.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I'm thinking to use riak as database for my next project but I don't
&gt; know how to deal with sorting and retrieve ordered/sliced data.
&gt; 
&gt; Use of map/reduce for simple queries to retrieve ordered data seems
&gt; complex for me, so I'm curious about to use an extra bucket to
&gt; implement a binary search tree using links for the buckets I need
&gt; ordered/sliced data. But I've found nobody using this strategy. Am I
&gt; missing some point ?
