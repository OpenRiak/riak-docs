I'm building an app in which Riak will (at least ideally) serve as both a 
database and object/blob store. 

I considered running a single
Riak cluster and installing Luwak, then dumping the large amounts of binary 
data alongside my JSON data, but the Luwak part of my cluster will grow much 
faster than the other sets of data. (I'm hoping to use Luwak as the storage 
engine behind a small CDN.) 

Two questions:

Is there a way to somehow separate my Luwak data from my regular K/V data? If 
so, I would like to put higher performance disks in the machines hosting Luwak 
nodes. 

If there isn't a solution to Q 1, then maybe I can run two clusters: one for my 
K/V data, and the other for Luwak alone? If I chose to go this route, does 
running Riak for Luwak alone cause any problems I should be aware of?

Thanks for your assistance. 

Nicholas
