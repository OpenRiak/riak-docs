We've used haproxy and have no complaints.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking to put a load balancer in front of my riak cluster but not
&gt; sure which one will work. I'm using both the HTTP interface and the
&gt; protocol buffers client. My connections from the PB client are kept open
&gt; for a long time, in fact they are pooled in my app and reused.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any recommendations for a load balancer for the PB client?
