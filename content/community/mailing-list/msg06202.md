Around 5% of the keys on that bucket are missing from the search
results. Not reassuring.

2012/1/10 francisco treacy :
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I am running (still) 0.14.2 in production, and using Riak Search to
&gt; index certain buckets. Those buckets have the Riak Search pre-commit
&gt; hook enabled.
&gt;
&gt; Once in a while I get complaints of missing documents from my clients,
&gt; and it just happened.
&gt;
&gt; I checked and the document:
&gt;  - is correctly stored in Riak
&gt;  - doesn't show up on the search query results \\*anymore\\*
&gt;
&gt; My workaround before was to go through every key in the bucket and
&gt; save it again, as to trigger the search hook. Of course, this is less
&gt; than ideal.
&gt;
&gt; Should I be looking for something specific in the logs? What could be
&gt; going on here?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Francisco
