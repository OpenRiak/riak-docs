Sorry to self-reply...I've been reading and have a short term answer to your 
3rd point, please see inline below. 

However I do think it could be baked into the API more clearly.

&gt;&gt; no-data returned
&gt;&gt; flag when doing a PUT to riak. I can't find the same thing in java.

When you store using RiakClient.store(RiakObject, RequestMeta) you can set up 
RequestMeta with arbitrary query params like

 RequestMeta requestMeta = RequestMeta.writeParams(3, 
3).setQueryParam(Constants.QP\\_RETURN\\_BODY, Boolean.toString(true));

then

 myClientInstance.store(myRiakObject, requestMeta);
