Mikhail,

I'll add something to virtualized option. If you start the vm's from a
snapshot vm that is already running, but with riak stopped, you could
possibly get it started and running in a couple of minutes or less. If
that is reasonable for your test suite, that seems like a good option.

&gt; that certainly sounds possible, but would extend the run time of your test
&gt; suite quite considerably, e.g. when you start a fresh set of virtualized
&gt; instances on every run.
&gt;
&gt; An alternative would be to always leave a Riak cluster running for testing
&gt; purposes and reset it after or before every complete test run, i.e. stop the
&gt; Riak processes, wipe the data, and start them up again.
&gt;
&gt; Ripple (Ruby client for Riak) and riak-js (Node.js client) both include a
&gt; test server that runs a Riak instance with an in-memory backend, maybe that
&gt; would be an alternative to go with?

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As part of our test suite I'd like to start a three node cluster for the
&gt; &gt; testing purposes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Could anyone [please! :)] comment on feasibility/possibility of such a
&gt; &gt; thing?
