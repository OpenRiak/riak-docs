Hi Wilson,

There is no official changelog available at the moment but you can get an
idea of the changes by reviewing the commits and files changed between the
versions:
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/compare/riak-client-0.11.0...riak-client-0.14.0

It looks like protocol buffers was added but there is no documentation.
There is an extremely minimal test here:
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/basho/riak/pbc/Test.java

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I noticed riak java client have been updated to 0.14, but there are no
&gt; info beyond the
&gt; original 0.11 version changelog. Any place I can find out what the changes
&gt; are?
&gt;
&gt; also, any more progress on protocol buffer support yet?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
