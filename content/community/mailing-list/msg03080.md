I actually had a question about that page. Why is it that when there
is a conflict we can only get the conflicting versions of the data?
If I'm going to try to resolve the conflict intelligently, I really
want the common ancestor as well so that I can try to do a 3-way
merge.


Good call. If an ancestor were available it would make counting and 
merging orthogonal changes \\*much\\* simpler.
