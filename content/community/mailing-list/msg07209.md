&gt; Thanks to your message and many months of requests for the same thing,
&gt; weâ€™ve decided to open up our prototype C/C++ client[1]. Please be warned
&gt; that this client library is incomplete and is not officially supported for
&gt; production use. That said, we will do our best to review bugs and
&gt; pull-requests in a timely manner.
&gt;
&gt; As with all of our open-source software, it is licensed under the Apache
&gt; 2.0 license and available on Github. We encourage everyone who is
&gt; interested to contribute.
