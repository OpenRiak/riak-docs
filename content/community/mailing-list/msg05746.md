Hello,

Try to use legacy mapred mode instead of pipe one(it's default in new riak
versions)? Maybe it's a finger into sky, but still may hit it :)

WBR,
Leonid

&gt; Hi!

&gt; I upgraded to riak-1.0.2.
&gt; I'm using the erlang client to execute a map/reduce on a bucket. In the
&gt; anterior version of riak I was using, this map/reduce was working very
&gt; well. But after the upgrade, it takes much time to end. When I attached the
&gt; riak node, I git this errir
&gt;
&gt; {undef,[{riak\\_kv\\_keys\\_fsm,start,[125220437,{&lt;&lt;20
&gt; bytes&gt;&gt;,[]},60000,mapred,3.000000e-05,&lt;0.409.0&gt;]}]}
&gt;
&gt; what changed in the erlang client map/reduce call ??
&gt;
&gt; PS: I'm using riak\\_pb\\_socket:mapred\\_bucket().
