I installed the binary kit of riak on my ubuntu 9.10 system.
I checked that the config files in /etc/riak were how I wanted them.
I typed "riak start". It says
 Attempting to restart script through sudo -u riak
 mkdir: cannot create directory `/var/run/riak/': Permission denied

Did I miss something? Does it want me to create a user named "riak"?
The installation instructions say nothing about this.
