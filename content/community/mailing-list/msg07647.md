That sounds like the perfect solution, design/POJO wise will allow the 
developer to use whatever Number  type while inside it is always a 
BigInteger. Very well thought out.

The problem with long on Java is that it's a signed 64 bit int which doesn't 
fully solve the issue; there would be someone out there that would send in a 
bug saying that when you hit 2^63 it rolled over.

The plan (if my memory is working, I have this written down on an ever growing 
todo list) is to switch to using BigInteger internally in RiakIndex with the 
interface / annotations allowing for any of the types to be passed in.

I would say just to add long and Long for indexing (So it that it supports 
Long, Integer and their respective natives), using BigNumber subclasses have a 
different semantic and would restrict the developers when designing the Riak 
POJOs.

All points to 32 bits, at least for the Java client side (indexes can be of 
type Integer, not Long which is the 64 bits) Look for RiakIndex.java, that will 
give you some answers.

That's a mistake on the part of the client developer at that time (me). They 
should probably be BigInteger, since integers can be arbitrarily large in 
erlang. I'm pretty sure Brian Roach (the new, smarter, Java developer) is 
addressing this https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/issues/112

I don’t know the exact answer though.

I would say yes... Probably, if you're on a 64bit system. . Unless you're 
shifting stuff through JavaScript in which case I doubt it. Cause last I 
checked, js don't speak 64bit int.

I apologize for asking this question if it's an FAQ or is documented somewhere,

in 2i:

I certainly could dive into to source code to answer this question, but in case 
someone here knows, what's the size of an integer index in 2i? I'm hoping that 
the answer will be that it's 64 bits…

Thanks,
