Super happy about this one, right what I need for tomorrow's trip to
EuRuKo. Thank for your awesome work Mathias-san! Rephrasing the song,
"You're awesome and you know it!"

Best,
Vlad

&gt; Hey there!
&gt;
&gt; Just thought I'd let you guys know that I just released a new version of the 
&gt; Riak Handbook, a free update if you already bought it. It comes with more 
&gt; than 40 pages of new content, focussing primarily on use cases and usage 
&gt; scenarios (data modelling, access patterns, pros and cons), operations (lots 
&gt; of details on monitoring, load-balancing and network placement of nodes), 
&gt; pre- and post-commit, plus a whole slew of little additions and fixes. Also, 
&gt; the book now comes as a man page for easy reading on the command line.
&gt;
&gt; You can read all about what's in the release here:

&gt;
&gt; To celebrate, the book is 25% off through next Monday:

&gt;
&gt; Cheers, Mathias
