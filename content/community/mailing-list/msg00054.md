I'll rephrase my question:

Is it possible to call external http services from a map function in
JavaScript and/or Erlang? Any comments/pointers appreciated.

Thanks,
Colin

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I am trying to figure what the fastest way would be to send a
&gt; mapreduce result set for indexing into a searchengine system like
&gt; elasticsearch.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, the trivial way to do it would be to simply gather the
&gt; result set and push it back into the indexer using their http/rest
&gt; api.
&gt;
&gt; Now, elasticsearch is distributed by nature and will allow parallel
&gt; queries for document insertion for indexing. One way to leverage this
&gt; would be to actually directly push a document from within a map
&gt; function into the indexer using their rest api. This would completely
&gt; distribute the index creation process and leverage the parallelism of
&gt; elasticsearch.
&gt;
&gt; Would this be possible?
&gt;
&gt; Is this something I could do using the JavaScript mapreduce? and/or Erlang?
&gt;
