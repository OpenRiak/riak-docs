I've only just now noticed that I have missed the "Planning Parameters"
section in: http://wiki.basho.com/LevelDB.html#Configuring-eLevelDB.

According to the information there and using the Excel calculator, it seems
that I'm 12% short on memory. I'll try to play around with the parameters in
order to get better memory allocation, but I would appreciate your advice as
to which parameters affect which function (write throughput, read
throughput, MR latency).

Thanks,
Shahar
