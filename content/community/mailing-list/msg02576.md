&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible to create a client to cluster of nodes instead of a
&gt; single node in the Riak Java API.
&gt; RiakClient riak = new RiakClient(config);
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the documentation, I have not found any method where I can specify
&gt; multiple URLS to the RiakClient and generate a client to a cluster.
&gt; 
&gt; So I am just confirming is this supported?

Not at present.

You could use haproxy between your Java client and the Riak cluster.

(Like Bob Feldbauer does

)

&gt; If not it would be a good feature to have.
