Thanks for the response Sean! Making the timestamp RFC 822 compliant did
indeed work. However, playing devils advocate, MDN documentaion states this

"Alternatively, the date/time string may be in ISO 8601 format. Starting
with JavaScript 1.8.5 / Firefox 4, a subset of ISO 8601 is supported. For
example, "2011-10-10" (just date) or "2011-10-10T14:48:00 (date and time)
can be passed and parsed. Timezones in ISO dates are not yet supported, so
e.g. "2011-10-10T14:48:00+0200" (with timezone) does not give the intended
result yet."

So is this b/c the version of Spidermonkey that Riak uses does not support
this? What version of Spidermonkey and Javascript does Riak use?

Thanks,
Ryan
