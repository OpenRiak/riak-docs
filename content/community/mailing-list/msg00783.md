It was a 32 bit version of R14B04, built from source.

The issue was caused by trying to install a 64 bit version of basho bench on
top of it.

Anyway, I realized that this was silly, and then installed a 64 bit R14B04
build of erlang.

Unfortunately now when I run make, basho bench complains that the version of
reltool &lt; 1.52, even though it's listed in the lib folder as reltool-0.5.3.
