Hey there,

I am considering Riak for a new project. One possible show stopper
for me is I believe Riak is not recommended for use on a VM which
would make cloud deployments (e.g. rackspace, ec2, etc) a no go. Also,
I read somewhere else the minimum EC2 deployment recommendation was 3
large instances which would run over $700 / month. Is it possible to
run Riak in the cloud and if so what is the minimum recommended
configuration?Â  Also, I'd be interested in hearing any recommendations
for initial configuration in a cloud environment.

Thanks!
