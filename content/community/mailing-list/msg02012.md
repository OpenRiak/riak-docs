I can find no documentation anywhere for the desired format for date fields in 
riak search.

I've looked at Lucene documentation thinking that it should be the same. From 
there I can see that Lucene made a significant transition at some point with 
respect to dates, but the documentation

http://lucene.apache.org/java/3\\_0\\_3/api/all/org/apache/lucene/document/DateTools.html#dateToString(java.util.Date,%20org.apache.lucene.document.DateTools.Resolution)
 
 
seems to suggest that the format is yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS. I tried this, but no 
joy.

I've tried using seconds since 1970, but at best this is only a stop gap 
because I have dates before 1970 that I need to consider.

I also tried using a standard field, hoping that lexographical ranges would 
work for me. Alas, I think the tokenizer is not indexing my dates because they 
don't look like useful things to index.

I am grateful for any hints.

Thanks,

PS -- Thanks to: Joseph Lambert and Rusty Klophaus for help with the numeric 
field issue; Jeremiah Peschka, and Runar Jordahl for helping with my question 
for sorted records, and Eric Moritz for pointing me towards Riak Search as the 
solution to that last issue.
