Hi Florian,

riak\\_object is the module used by the native Erlang client and was used
before the protocol buffers interface existed.

riakc\\_obj is used by the Erlang protocol buffers client and does not depend
on any Riak KV code.

Re-factoring the code to use a single module seems like a good idea; pull
requests are always welcome if you want to give it a shot.

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Hi All,

&gt; I am using the erlang protocol buffers client which uses riakc\\_obj to
&gt; handle riak objects. As I understand riak uses riak\\_object internally.
&gt; Looking at the functions the modules look almost identical. Why is it done
&gt; that way?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
