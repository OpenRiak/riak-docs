Excited for an overhaul. Something brought up in discussions with other PHP
devs, is the need to separate each class into it's own file.
Also, separating out the actual transport logic would be a good move.

And yes, 5.3+ minimum would be a good step forward. Anyone on 5.2 could just
stick with the current client if they're intent on 5.2. No need to ignore
5.3 features or bloat the client due to supporting 5.2 \\*and\\* 5.3.

&gt; Riak 1.0 is coming soon.
&gt; Now would be a good time to overhaul the PHP client.
&gt;
&gt; Goals
&gt;
&gt; - Add support for Protocol Buffers
&gt; - Add support for new Riak 1.0 features (2i, pr, pw, client\\_id, etc)
&gt; - Add performance benchmarks
&gt; - Improve network performance
&gt; - Improve tests
&gt; - Add support for streaming results
&gt; - Add automatic read-before-write
&gt; - Add support for retries and sibling resolution
&gt; - Discourage expensive operations by throwing warnings
&gt;
&gt; I also think it's time the client required PHP 5.3+
&gt;
&gt; - Namespacing for better class organization
&gt; - Late static binding for looser coupling and greater extensibility
&gt; - Anonymous functions for inline retries and sibling resolution
&gt;
&gt; Is there anyone using PHP 5.2 in production with Riak that hasn't upgraded
&gt; to PHP 5.3?
