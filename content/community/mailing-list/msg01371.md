The \\_rsid\\_ bucket keeps the transformed/indexed document around for use 
when returning results (regardless of whether the indexing precommit hook is 
installed); so yes, you'll have some duplication of data when using Riak Search 
for both your normal storage and your search indexing needs.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; While playing with Riak Search through the Solr interface, I noticed
&gt; that my documents are automatically written in bitcask under the
&gt; bucket "\\_rsid\\_". Is it a feature of the Solr interface and is
&gt; there a way to prevent the document being indexed to be stored ? If I
&gt; use a Riak K/V hook, I guess that the documents are not stored twice
&gt; in bitcask ?
