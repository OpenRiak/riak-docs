Hello,

I have a Riak cluster that is up and accepts PUTs and GETs. I'm trying to use 
the search features and it looks like the Erlang processes for search are not 
running. I keep getting 'noproc' errors. Search has always been enabled on this 
cluster, I did not add search later on. The search feature appears in 
"riak-admin status", so the code has at least been loaded by Riak. Riak is not 
leaving any logs besides crash.log, which contains the same error message that 
search-cmd printed.

How can I get search working? Thanks.
