Sean,

I understand that they are still used when provided. The more fundamental
question is: as good Riak citizens, should we consider Client IDs
deprecated, and stop using them in new projects?

&gt; Client IDs are still used if the riak\\_kv / vnode\\_vclocks setting is false.
&gt; If it is true, the client ID will simply be ignored. For compatibility's
&gt; sake, it's best to send/set them still.

&gt;&gt; I guess the fundamental question is: In new clusters unaffected by
&gt;&gt; pre-1.0 shenanigans, should we \\*ever\\* be using client-provided ClientIds
&gt;&gt; in our vector clocks, or is this method deprecated?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I ask because I was deep into figuring out how to do this efficiently
&gt;&gt; with the Riak PBC API for PUT requests, when I realized that the
&gt;&gt; documentation for HTTP PUT no longer even mentions 
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; .
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If client-id isn't totally deprecated, I will probably start finding a
&gt;&gt; way to shoehorn it into individual PBC PUT requests, as keeping a
&gt;&gt; per-connection client id is very onwieldy. Please advise. :)
