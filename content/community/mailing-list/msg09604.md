I am using the latest github checkouts for both riak and the python
client. Up until the .prepare() part everything seems to be working
fine.

However, the moment I call .start() the process enters an infinite
loop in wait\\_for\\_erlang\\_prompt(). It appears that there is constantly
newline output coming from self.\\_server.stdout()

Does anyone have any ideas what is wrong here?
