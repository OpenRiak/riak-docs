Please give me a link from which i can find full luwak documentation. I 
want to see the metadata of a file stored in Luwak but could not find 
any way to retrieve it..
https://wiki.basho.com/Luwak.html this link does not provide details in 
depth. Please guide me... I want to use it as a redundant file server so 
need all these information immediately...
