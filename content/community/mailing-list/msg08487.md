Hey Antoine,

Sorry for the delay here. Just for the sake of completeness, can you
provide the MapReduce job that's not running?

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I'm a complete newbie in the riak world, and I'd like to understand a basic
&gt; thing.
&gt;
&gt; I'm testing and trying to query riak with a basic map, which is \\*very\\*
&gt; similar to the basho fast-track first example
&gt; (http://wiki.basho.com/attachments/simple-map.json)
&gt;
&gt; The thing is that I can't seem to manage to make this work with riak-defined
&gt; keys.
&gt;
&gt; Here's a gist to illustrate my problem : https://gist.github.com/3636321
&gt; 1 - I POST data with cURL (the content of the two lines are identical except
&gt; for the keys)
&gt;
&gt; 2- I try to MapReduce (currently without any filters)
&gt;
&gt; 3- the Output I get, the first one's got an error that I cannot (yet)
&gt; understand :)
&gt;
&gt; Could anyone help me to make my first steps in MapReducing ? :-)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
