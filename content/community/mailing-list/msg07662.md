Riak Users,

As some of you have noticed we have been committing small changes here and 
there to help support building Riak on BSD's. We have now gone taken the next 
step to officially support a BSD with packages in a release. I wrote up a 
short blog post about our coming support for FreeBSD in the next major Riak 
release here http://basho.com/blog/technical/2012/06/11/Supporting-Riak-on-BSD/

Please send any comments, suggestions, hate mail my way.

Thanks,
Jared
