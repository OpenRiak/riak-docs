&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently using riak\\_kv as a reference of how to implement riak\\_core and 
&gt; see that whenever a new coordinator process is needed, a new one is created 
&gt; via their supervisor. But in the case of the get and put coordinators, the 
&gt; supervisor is not used.
&gt; 
&gt; Besides eliminating the supervisor as a potential bottleneck, is there any 
&gt; reason why the supervisor is not used?

AFAIK it is only that (eliminating a potential bottleneck.) It is an 
optimisation added to the kv code in the last few weeks.
