I was thinking of using memcached for cheap, fast storage to share
between servers. I need to store stuff like user preferences,
permissions, session etc. But memcached (I think) requires you to
define which servers you want to use for storage. Ideally I don't
care. I want my core/auth server to write preferences and permissions
to the cache and let tornado on other servers pull those keys out. I
think Riak could perform this in theory, but is Riak fast enough?


Memcached lets you set up a group of servers and configure the clients to know 
about all of them. After that, distribution is handled automatically over the 
set, but you can't count on the storage being persistent - that is, a server may 
fail or values may be evicted, and the clients need to be able to retrieve them 
from a slower db and replenish them in the cache. Membase uses a similar 
interface but does provide persistent storage.
