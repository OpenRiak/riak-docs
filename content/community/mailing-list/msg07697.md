Welle is an expressive Clojure client for Riak with batteries included.

1.1.0 is a small release: a bug fix and two minor features:

 \\* core.cache implementation no longer depends on compilation order
 \\* A new convenience function for deleting objects via 2i queries
 \\* Cluster client support for both HTTP and PBC transports
