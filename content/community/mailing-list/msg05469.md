Hi, guys

 I am using luwak as dfs, right now we have couple riak nodes like 10
there. Here is the problem we encountered, after write file success, the
next read operation always fail. it happens when that is a little bit big
file size. is there any way to get rid of that. because we want the user
can get that file which is uploaded by him real time. For example, write
file to riak node 3 should always guarantee the next read operation on that
file to riak node 3 should be success.

thanks

Fisher
