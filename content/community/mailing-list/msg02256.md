Francisco,

This is great. I was just to write a bunch of stuff based on my example, but I 
am now happy to use your new branch instead. It works on my end, but I would 
suggest that you add 'sort' as another element in Meta.queryProperties as well.

Thanks again,

&gt; Gary,

&gt; Check out the 'search' branch on github:
&gt; https://github.com/frank06/riak-js/blob/search/src/http\\_client.coffee#L133
&gt; (follow development instructions on the README to work with the bleeding edge)
&gt; 
&gt; I'd love to hear some feedback. Docs updated at http://riakjs.org.

&gt;&gt; I am using riak-js for connecting with riak from within node.
&gt;&gt; However, riak-js does not support any search APIs. I wrote a small
&gt;&gt; example in node.js to show how to hit the SOLR interface, which I've
&gt;&gt; shared with the developer of riak-js with the hope that he runs with
&gt;&gt; it. Nonetheless, some of you may find this gist helpful:
