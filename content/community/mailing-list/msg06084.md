Ryan,

Thanks for the timely answer.

Yea, faceting in code doesn't sound like the right solution. :)

In the talk 'Riak Search Explained,' Daniel Reverri described how Riak
Search integrates with Riak KV via a Pre-Commit Hook. If you were to
roll your own search (Solr Cluster), is the recommendation to initiate
a indexing process from a Pre-Commit Hook as opposed to a Post-Commit
Hook?

Thanks again,
Simeon

&gt; There are currently no plans to implement faceted queries.  The first
&gt; thought is that you pull back all results and do the faceting yourself, but
&gt; what's the point of that, right?  I think other than that some Erlang would
&gt; need to be written for Search to properly support faceting.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In the meantime, is there a recommended alternative way to build
&gt;&gt; facets with Riak-Search?
&gt;&gt;
