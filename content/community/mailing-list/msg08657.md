Hey list,

I'm upgrading to Riak 1.2 and moving over to the latest Python bindings at
the same time. What's the current recommended install process for this? I'd
(obviously) like to use pip for simplicity - but it seems that's not
currently working (details below). I recall manually installing protobuf
once upon a time, but I thought we were beyond this now?

Thanks y'all
