&gt; Hi,

&gt; Assuming I'm understanding your use case correctly, the first option seems 
&gt; like your best bet. 
&gt; 
&gt; Primary key lookups are where Riak really shines, and if you're only GET-ing 
&gt; one key and then manipulating the associated json-dict with some app code, 
&gt; things should perform quite well (assuming your objects aren't huge). 
&gt; 
&gt; Does that make sense? Or did I misunderstand things?
I think so. I am basically trying to find out what is faster for largish 
buckets (hundreds of millions of json blobs, but each relatively small -- 
around 500 to 700 bytes or so):

\\* single level link walking
\\* secondary indexes where there is only ever one possible result for a given 
index value
\\* a separate bucket where a store a key as a value/'pointer', which would 
correspond to another key in another bucket (basically a self-roll of one of 
the above).
