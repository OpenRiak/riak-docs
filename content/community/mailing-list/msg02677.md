Right, I remember now. At the moment I'm inclined toward leaving the job of 
load balancing to a load balancer (like haproxy.)

I guess it is feasible to add something like this to the Java client, maybe 
with naive (RR) load balancing, but done as a strategy so more sophisticated 
load balancing could be contributed. 

The Riak cluster is an elastic thing and adding/removing nodes is operationally 
normal; load balancing is a problem in its own right. At the moment I'd say it 
is only a tentative yes for some future version. Of course a barrage of +1s 
would encourage a re-think.
