Thanks Alexander,

Is there any facility in riak that enables me to do something like this:

UPDATE obj set link=nil where link='Blah';

Kind regards,
Joshua

&gt; Riak links are unidirectional and non-reciprocal. If you did not
&gt; explixitly set a link on the child to the parent then it does not
&gt; exist. If you did set links on the children then a traversal/loop will
&gt; work but remember to include the body (value) in the rewrite. Write
&gt; links + body or you lose the body.

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a link between Parent object and Child objects
&gt; &gt; e.g:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Parent
&gt; &gt; -- Child1
&gt; &gt; -- Child2
&gt; &gt; -- Child3
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now when I delete Parent, I want the links from Child to Parent to be
&gt; &gt; removed as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can traverse/loop through all the Children that Parent have and remove
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; link one by one, but I was thinking if there is a more elegant way to do
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; in Riak that I don't know.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am using the Ruby Riak/Ripple library.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Kind regards,
&gt; &gt; Joshua.
