HA! I just ran into this limit!

5,000 links like /tablet\\_users/whoever riaktag=following will cause your 
user objects to take upwards of 4 seconds to return, on our beefy 
cluster, with a variance of ~3 seconds. (Over HTTP, ruby riak\\_client.) I 
had to move them into the JSON body, which makes things much faster. 
Hundreds of links seems just fine.

Hi,

Sorry for the Lil Kim reference on the subject line, I couldn't help it :-)

In the links documentation on wiki.basho.com , it
says:
"this can substitute as a lightweight graph database, as long as the
number of links attached to a given key are kept reasonably low"

What's considered reasonably low here? tens? hundreds? thousands? millions?

Has anyone published benchmarks or stress-testing results of this
anywhere for me to take a look?

Thank you,
