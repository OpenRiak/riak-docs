Hi,

I'm thinking to use riak as database for my next project but I don't
know how to deal with sorting and retrieve ordered/sliced data.

Use of map/reduce for simple queries to retrieve ordered data seems
complex for me, so I'm curious about to use an extra bucket to
implement a binary search tree using links for the buckets I need
ordered/sliced data. But I've found nobody using this strategy. Am I
missing some point ?
