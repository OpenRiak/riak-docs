Hi

I would like to use Riak, but counters is a must in this project. They are so 
handy :-)

I tried to build the riak-dt, but the build-system seems broken. I get this 
when i do make devrel:

ERROR: generate failed while processing /Users/petter/erlang/riak/rel: 
{'EXIT',{{badmatch,{error,"luke: : Missing application directory."}},
 [{rebar\\_reltool,generate,2,[]},
 {rebar\\_core,run\\_modules,4,[]},
 {rebar\\_core,execute,5,[]},
 {rebar\\_core,process\\_dir0,6,[]},
 {rebar\\_core,process\\_dir,4,[]},
 {rebar\\_core,process\\_commands,2,[]},
 {rebar,main,1,[]},
 {escript,run,2,[{file,"escript.erl"},{line,741}]}]}}

Any clues?

The riak-dt does also seem a little bit forgotten - no commits in a couple of 
months. Is it still planned?

Cheers,

Petter
