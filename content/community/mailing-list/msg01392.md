Hi Guys,

I just put the wikipedia riaksearch solr index ready XMLs to the: 

 http://rapidshare.com/files/427591191/wikipedia350.tar.gz 

you can download from there. 

there is also a small keyword list for benchmark test.

We can put bigger documents later ie 3 million wikipedia doc. 

Let us know your test results. I used Apache Jmeter to send 10 clients queering 
to the clusters (3 machine)

Best Regards

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; We have prepare wikipedia database output ready to submit RiakSearch. It is
&gt; &gt; XML and described format for solr submit. Each file has 20.000 Document and
&gt; &gt; totaly 15 xml files. Each file around 44 MB.
&gt; &gt; You can submit all XML 's = bin/search-cmd solr wikipedia
&gt; &gt; /wikipedia/content-xml-out/wikipedia\\_1.xml
&gt; &gt; So you only need to submit this files to the riaksearch and than make a
&gt; &gt; benchmark test/tune and share your experience.
&gt; &gt; I would like to ask Riak Admin guys is there any place that I can share
&gt; &gt; these files for public access to start collaborative tests ?
&gt; &gt; Second phase I can put 3 million wikipedia XML sets to ready to submit
&gt; &gt; riaksearch. So All we have some common benchmark and tuning parameters.
&gt; &gt; I hope this will help the riaksearch community to better understanding its
&gt; &gt; capability.
&gt; &gt; Best Regards
&gt; &gt;
