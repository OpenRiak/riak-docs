Good to hear that the package arrived safely. (I think what I'm most pleased
about is that you were able to decipher my handwriting on the note.)

Read the TOS on that t-shirt carefully, btw. By accepting the delivery, you
agree to wear it every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and are required to
wear it to any technical talks/presentations where your coworkers/colleagues
happen to be presenting on non-Riak data storage technologies. :)

Enjoy.

&gt; Got home from work today to find a package waiting for me from Basho
&gt;
&gt; Consisted of a Riak/Basho t-shirt, a variety of Riak & Basho stickers, and
&gt; a quite-nice-note-on-the-back-of-his-business-card from Mark Phillips :-)
&gt; Definitely a welcome surprise, as receiving packages always makes it feel
&gt; like Christmas for me, lol.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers to Mark and all at Basho, thanks for the gifts!
&gt;
&gt; Gotta love a company that gives out swag to it's community members, eh? Not
&gt; like I wasn't already, but now I'm definitely such a fanboy that I'm afraid
&gt; I'll get a Rasho :-D
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again!
