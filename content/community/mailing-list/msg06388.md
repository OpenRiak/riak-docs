Hi Carl,

The URL on the Wiki is incorrect. It should be:
http://host:port/buckets/mybkt/keys

I will make sure the Wiki is updated.

Thanks,

&gt; I am trying to write a record with Riak supplying the key. According to
&gt; the information at
&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/HTTP-Store-Object.html the following should work:
&gt;
&gt; curl -X POST -d "foo" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" http://host:port
&gt; /buckets/mybkt
&gt;
&gt; But when I try it I get a 404 "Not found" error. Adding "/keys/k1" to the
&gt; end of the URL makes it work. Is the wiki page incorrect?
