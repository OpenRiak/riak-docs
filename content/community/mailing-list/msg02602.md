&gt;&gt; Is this intentional?  It seems like odd default behavior.

&gt; Most databases, including Riak, do not write to a file every time you
&gt; do a GET, SELECT, or other query as appropriate.
&gt;
&gt; This is because the additional disk I/O of an access log imposes a
&gt; performance cost that many do not wish to pay.  As you note, it can be
&gt; turned on -- but we believe that by default production users generally
&gt; are happier with it off and do not expect such a human-readable log
&gt; for database accesses.
&gt;
&gt; I agree that the way to turn it on should be clearly documented.  I
&gt; would add that we should make sure that the documentation warns people
&gt; not to turn it on except in testing/debugging scenarios.
&gt;
&gt; Best,
