Hi Rusty ,

Thanks

I already tried. :) but it give error and trying to teach me sytnax as in help 
:) 

It is accepting : bin/search-cmd solr testwiki /root/DATA/output/ 

but gives error for : 

bin/search-cmd solr testwiki /root/DATA/output/\\*.xml 

As you aware We are trying to do some benchmark test on riaksearch. We have 
customers have billions of doc. Working with current lucene / Solr is a 
operational nightmare ( yes it is).

So we are looking for a replacement for those customers. This is why we are one 
of the early tester of the RiakSearch. 

Best Regards

Prometheus

&gt; Hi Prometheus,
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, you can either put the files into a directory and then provide a command 
&gt; line pointing to the directory, ie:
&gt; 
&gt; bin/search-cmd solr index path/to/directory
&gt; 
&gt; Or you can specify a wildcard using '\\*':
&gt; 
&gt; bin/search-cmd solr index path/to/directory/\\*.xml
&gt; 
&gt; Best,

&gt; Hi ,
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anyway to submit more than one file in :
&gt; 
&gt; "search-cmd solr INDEX abc.xml ? "
&gt; 
&gt; it is not accepting \\*.xml or 1.xml 2.xml in the same command line..
