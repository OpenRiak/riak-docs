You can disable Nagle on the riak side (at least on 0.14 and later). Put this 
in the riak\\_core section of app.config:

{disable\\_http\\_nagle, true}


Shouldn't that be the default if clients are able to cache connections? 
 You'll normally get the delay if your protocol isn't a strict serial 
handshake and you need to send a small packet with data already 
outstanding (like at the end of a request where the socket isn't being 
closed).
