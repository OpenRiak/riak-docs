Hello Riak Users!


I am working on a testing Riak cluster and have some questions about 
disks on nodes.


1 - How big or small disk arrays we should use with riak nodes when we 
have 1GBS network between nodes and have 8GB ram on each nodes. Does 
nodes have limitations like ram cpu, bandwith while storing too big data 
consist of many small files.


2 - Is it ok to use different size of disks with riak nodes. For exaple, 
100GB for 1st node , 300GB for second node, 500GB for third node etc. 
How will Riak handle the data distrubition and replication in this 
situation in a large cluster of nodes. (if we have 20 or 50 nodes in 
the cluster)


3- When disk on one of nodes become full, what will happen ?

 Node will continue serving files but it will not accept any new 
data, Node will accept any read, delete request but will not accept any 
write request so new files will be written to another node with enough 
disk space ?
 Node will stop serving files and will go dead. So the files in that 
node will replicated to another node ?

 We can mount new disks to that node to increase total disk volume ?
 Which condition is ture ?

4- Is Riak support multiple disks for data storage, if yes have can we 
make this?

Thanks,
Yusuf
