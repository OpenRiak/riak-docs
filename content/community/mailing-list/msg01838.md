Morning, Afternoon, Evening to All,

For today's Recap we have more Spring/Grails work from Jon Brisbin and
various Q & A.

Enjoy.

On an administrative note, I won't be writing a Recap this Friday on
account of the holiday, but if someone wants to step up and write one,
please feel free. If not, regularly scheduled Recaps will pick back up
on Monday, 12/27.

Happy Holidays to everyone. (Remember to give the gift of Riak this year.)

Riak Recap for Dec. 20 - 21

1) For any of you Vector Clock fans out there, a project called
"goclock" just surfaced, which aims to provide full vector clock
support for Google's Go. The post references a few Basho blogs on
vector clocks that some of you might recognize.

2) More Spring/Grails awesomeness from Jon. Brisbin

\\* Related tweet from @wmacgyver that's worth passing along - (because
we agree :) http://twitter.com/wmacgyver/status/17340803990953985)


3) Q --- Are there any open issues on ripple that people can work on
who have a good knowledge of Ruby but are new to Riak?

 A --- There sure are. Feel free to pick any one that interest you.
See https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/issues#issue to get involved.

4) SamuraiJack\\_\\_ posted this in #riak on 12/20:

"I thought someone from this channel may find this interesting:
http://joose.it/blog/2010/10/11/introducing-kiokujs/ It has no Riak
backend at the moment, but should be trivial to realize,

5) @peschkaj gave an interview about why is he spending more of his
time these days on NoSQL DBs. Riak gets a few shout outs.

6) This question appeared on Quora yesterday:
http://www.quora.com/Databases/When-would-you-use-Riak-HyperTable-or-MongoDB

(@ericflo took an admirable stab at it but it could definitely use
some fleshing out if anyone is feeling brave. )
