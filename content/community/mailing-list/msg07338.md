&gt; We are beginning to use Riak Core and I noticed there are no edocs for the

&gt; eyes on it having more documentation would be a big win. Edocs would
&gt; probably be a pretty quick and easy start. For example, having basic
&gt; documentation around methods like `riak\\_core\\_vnode:reply/2` and types like
&gt; `sender()` & `sender\\_type()` would be a big help. I suppose we could
&gt; generate them ourselves but having something officially kept up to date and
&gt; hosted by Basho would be awesome.

Here's a Friday gift for you:

http://basho.github.com/riak\\_core/

Caveat: these aren't perfectly up to date yet. We'll be updating
them incrementally (and also publishing them for other repos) but there
will be a bunch of comments that are out of date at the moment.

Enjoy. Contributions Welcome. :)
