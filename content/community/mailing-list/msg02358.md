I have a sneaky suspicion it's the json encoder. I used json myself to
encode the data before passing it to bucket.new() (not even sure if
this is valid!) and the cpu usage dropped to 1%.

&gt; Sorry, I should have been more clear. Â The Python client depends on
&gt; "protobuf&gt;=2.3.0" in setup.py, so people are already most likely using
&gt; protobufs-2.3.0.

&gt; Hi Andy.
&gt;
&gt; I am not quite sure what you mean, is the protobuf library included with
&gt; riak-python-client? Or are you talking about the version of the protobuf
&gt; compiler that was used to create riakclient\\_pb2.py from
&gt; riakclient.proto?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,

&gt; python-riak-client already uses version 2.3.0. Adventurous types
&gt; might want to check out https://github.com/Greplin/fast-python-pb,
&gt; which wraps the C/C++ protocol buffers library.

&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt;
&gt; perhaps you can try to upgrade the protocol buffers library to at
&gt; least
&gt; version 2.3.0. This is from the changelog for that version:
&gt;
&gt; Python
&gt; \\* 10-25 times faster than 2.2.0, still pure-Python.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; Will do when I get time. Would the REST API be any faster?

&gt; I would highly recommend looking in to the cProfile and pstat
&gt; module and
&gt; profile the code that is going slow. If your using the protocol
&gt; buffer
&gt; client it could possibly be related to the fact that python
&gt; protocol buffers
&gt; is extraordinarily slow and is well known to be slow. Profile
&gt; until proven
&gt; guilty though.

&gt; I added some code to my system to test writing data into Riak.
&gt; I'm
&gt; using the Python client library with protocol buffers. I'm
&gt; writing a
&gt; snapshot of my current data, which is one json object
&gt; containing on
&gt; average 60 individual json sub-objects. Each sub object
&gt; contains about
&gt; 22 values.
&gt;
&gt; # Archived entry. ts is a formatted timestamp.
&gt; entry = self.\\_bucket.new(ts, data=data)
&gt; entry.store()
&gt;
&gt; # Now write the current entry.
&gt; entry = self.\\_bucket.new("current", data=data)
&gt; entry.store()
&gt;
&gt; I'm writing the same data twice; the archived copy and the
&gt; current
&gt; copy, which I can easily retrieve later. Performance is lower
&gt; than
&gt; expected; top is showing a constant cpu usage of 10-12%.
&gt;
&gt; I haven't decided to use Riak; this is to help me decide. But
&gt; for now
&gt; are there any optimisations I can do here? A similiar test
&gt; with
&gt; MongoDB shows a steady cpu usage of 1%. The cpu usages are for
&gt; my
&gt; client, not Riak's own processes. The only differences in my
&gt; test app
&gt; is the code that writes the data to the database. Otherwise
&gt; all other
&gt; code is 100% the same between these two test apps.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions appreciated.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Mike
