Hi,

I just started with learning documentation and playing with Riak so I have
few questions:

1. Can I set custom HTTP headers for HTTP API?
2. Can I enable e.x. just HTTP GET requests?


And general question:
e.x. I have list of zip codes and want to expose that data via REST(just for
reading).

Is it good idea to use riak for such task?

Best regards,
Anton Podviaznikov
