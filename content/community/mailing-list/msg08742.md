probably it was mentioned before but all I can goolge is the post about
python client. I couldnt find it anywhere on github's wiki.
Reading readme for legacy pb java client I found that that client was
thread safe. and if that implementation was used later as base for curent
riak java pb client I guess it should have same capabilities.

I assume that riak client implementations are thread safe but created
bucket (with execute call) and store/get operation are not and should be
instantiated per thread.

thanks for clearing this out
