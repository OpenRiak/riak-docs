Those random keys are not as random as you may think they are at first blush. 
If you look at the actual code, 
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_core/blob/master/src/riak\\_core\\_util.erl#L131, you 
will see that it is a base62 encoded sha hash of a unique reference within the 
erlang runtime, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Erlang\\_Programming/Terms, and 
now(), aka. the time.
