Hi,

I'm trying to upgrade my Riak 0.14 nodes and encountered some problems.
After installing the riak-1.0 rpm and trying to start the node I'm getting the 
following error message:

riak start
Attempting to restart script through sudo -u riak
pthread/ethr\\_event.c:98: Fatal error in wait\\_\\_(): Function not implemented (38)
pthread/ethr\\_event.c:98: Fatal error in wait\\_\\_(): Function not implemented (38)
Error reading /etc/riak/app.config

When installing the riak-1.0 rpm I'm getting the following output:

sudo rpm -Uvh riak-1.0.0-1.el5.x86\\_64.rpm

in addition, I noticed that the app.config did not update as it should on the 
installation process.


Can you please advise what could be the cause of this error?

Thanks,
Tom.
