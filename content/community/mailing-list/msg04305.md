Hmm. Not that I know of. Afaik, the memcache server itself is
standalone.


Yes, that's the point - there's no constraint on how many you have and 
they don't need to replicate (but they also aren't reliable for persistence)



Any distributed magic happens at the client level via some
circular hashing voodoo or sharding pixie dust. Keep the client mojo and
swap memcached for redis.


The distribution works because it is strictly key/value so the key 
hashing is all you need. But, it also works because someone has spent a 
lot of time making it work reasonably when some of the servers fail. 
You'd have to repeat that work for anything else and then it still 
probably wouldn't cache better than memcache.
