Hi,

I tried the below for testing to see if riak was running on a node but
I get connection failed.

check process riak matching "/usr/lib/riak/erts-5.8.5/bin/beam"
 group riak
 start program = "service riak start"
 if failed host localhost port 8098
 protocol HTTP request "/" then alert

What in lieu of a pip, what is best practice for using monit with riak?

will a ping suffice? e.g.

service riak ping
Attempting to restart script through sudo -u riak
pong


Thanks
