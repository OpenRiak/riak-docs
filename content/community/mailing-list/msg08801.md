&gt; I want to create a model that I can save to its own bucket, but also be able

&gt; 
&gt; Specifically I want to create a Message model, that I can save and lookup 
&gt; easily. I also want to embed a copy of that class in a ReceivedMessage 
&gt; class. I would like to work with these models as such:
&gt; 
&gt; message = Message.new
&gt; message.body = 'foo'
&gt; message.save!
&gt; 
&gt; received = ReceivedMessage.new
&gt; received.messages &lt;&lt; message
&gt; received.save!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; By doing this I know I have 2 copies of the message, but I'm alright with 
&gt; that. I'm optimizing for reads not storage space. 
&gt; My endgame is that I want to look up messages without looking through the 
&gt; recieved messages, and I want a user to quickly view all received messages 
&gt; without looking up each individual message.
