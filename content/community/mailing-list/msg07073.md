&gt; &gt; &gt; I just wanted to take a second and share some details on a new Riak-based

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; \\* Large Object Support
&gt; &gt; Does it mean the the retired Luwak was replaced with something that is
&gt; &gt; not going to be available in an open-source version?
&gt; We've talked about our motivations for writing a new large file storage
&gt; component before on the mailing list [1][2]. The Luwak code [3] will
&gt; continue to be available and open source, and anyone who is ambitious and
&gt; determined is invited to take over the code and continue its development.
&gt; I'll happily include your changes in the Recap. :)
&gt; 
&gt; The new large file component does not share a single line of code with
&gt; Luwak. Our commitment to open source remains as strong as ever and, in
&gt; addition to the many libraries we maintain [4] and contribute to, we'll
&gt; continue to release new code as rapidly as our product road map allows.
The bottom line -- "yes" :) Thanks, Mark.
