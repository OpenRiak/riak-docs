Hi Nitish,

If you rebuild the cluster with the same ring size, the data will
eventually get back to the right place. While the rebuild is taking place
you may have notfounds for gets until the data has been handed off to the
newly assigned owner (as it will be secondary handoff, not primary
ownership handoff to get teh data back). If you don't have a lot of data
stored in the cluster it shouldn't take too long.

The process would be to stop all nodes, move the files out of the ring
directory to a safe place, start all nodes and rejoin. If you're using
1.1.x and you have capacity in your hardware you may want to increase
handoff\\_concurrency to something like 4 to permit more transfers to happen
across the cluster.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; We have a 12-node Riak cluster. Until now we were naming every new node as
&gt; riak@. We then decided to rename the all the nodes to 
&gt; riak@,
&gt; which makes troubleshooting easier.
&gt; After issuing reip command to two nodes, we noticed in the "status" that
&gt; those 2 nodes were now appearing in the cluster with the old name as well
&gt; as the new name. Other nodes were trying to handoff partitions to the "new"
&gt; nodes, but apparently they were not able to. After this the whole cluster
&gt; went down and completely stopped responding to any read/write requests.
&gt; member\\_status displayed old Riak name in "legacy" mode. Since this is our
&gt; production cluster, we are desperately looking for some quick remedies.
&gt; Issuing "force-remove" to the old names, restarting all the nodes, changing
&gt; the riak names back to the old ones - none of it helped.
&gt; Currently, we are hosting limited amount of data. Whats an elegant way to
&gt; recover from this mess? Would shutting off all the nodes, deleting the ring
&gt; directory, and again forming the cluster work?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt; Nitish
