I know Bitcask has the expiry\\_secs option for expiring keys, but what about 
LevelDB? We're thinking of using Luwak as a file cache frontend to S3, and it 
would be nice for older entries to be deleted in LRU order as we store newer 
files. This could be implemented as a storage quota also (high/low water mark).

Thanks,
Nate
