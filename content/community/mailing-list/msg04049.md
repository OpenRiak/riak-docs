Hey all,

Just wondering... is anyone using, or have tried out riak-ql?
https://github.com/frank06/riak-ql

Not because I developed it -- but I'm regularly making use of it and I
think it kicks ass. Especially in the repl in combo with riak-js.

What do you guys think?

Francisco

ps: really curious/excited about the upcoming Secondary Indices functionality
