It was mentioned in an old webinar recap, that JS functions could be stored
in Riak as a objects in a bucket, and then executed via mapreduce.
While this was mentioned as possible, no example was provided, and Google
is turning up nothing useful for me.

Could someone please provide an example of how JS functions stored in a
Riak bucket could then be used against results of a map or reduce phase?

Recap article:

(over halfway down, mentions that functions could be stored in
bucket/key)


Thanks!
