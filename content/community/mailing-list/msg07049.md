Hi Jonathan,

&gt; It was mentioned in an old webinar recap, that custom JS functions could be

&gt; While this was mentioned as possible, no example was provided, and Google is 
&gt; turning up nothing useful for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Could someone please provide an example of how custom JS functions stored in 
&gt; a Riak bucket could then be used against results of a map or reduce phase?
&gt; 
&gt; Recap article: 
&gt; http://basho.com/blog/technical/2010/07/27/webinar-recap---mapreduce-querying-in-riak/
&gt; (over halfway down, mentions that functions could be stored in bucket/key) 

There is an example in the wiki documentation here 
http://wiki.basho.com/MapReduce.html#Map, it describes the specification

 {"map":{"language":"javascript","bucket":"myjs","key":"mymap"}}

You'd need to store an object who's value was a valid javascript phases 
function at 'myjs'/'key'.

Cheers

Russell
