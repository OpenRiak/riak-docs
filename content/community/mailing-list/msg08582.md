Hi,

Could anyone provide a basic working example using a map/reduce
combining "starts\\_with" and "tokenize" so that I can see if my syntax is
wrong or if something else brings me the famous
"{"error":"map\\_reduce\\_error"}"

still can't figure out how to make it work :

Hi,
Seems to have been indeed a problem in the map/reduce query (which 
wasn't easy to point out, because the JSON itself was correct but not 
the M/R query). Problem solved thanks to David M.'s help :)
