&gt; &gt;&gt; Does this mean there is still an intention to support storing larger
&gt; &gt;&gt; values in Riak in the future?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Or is this something the client libraries should implement?
&gt; 
&gt; You could certainly implement the necessary chunking and such in client
&gt; libraries. However, it's a pretty big set of functionality and getting it to
&gt; work right with in partitioned circumstances (i.e. with
&gt; siblings) can be a challenge. As such, I don't expect that to be part of the
&gt; standard client libraries anytime soon.
&gt; 

I think this pretty much kills why I started playing with riak in the first 
place; local version of S3.

To me it seems that this is turning into another simple database, for which 
there are way too many right now. I had wrote my own storage engine prior to 
finding riak which basically stored files and made sure it was replicated to x 
additional nodes (as well as s3) and the index was stored in a replicated mysql 
database. It was my hope that this would be the replacement for that.

So, I guess I'm saying that, in my opinion, this project is going in a 
direction that no longer really supports my needs/goals. I think it has 
potential still, but it needs to find a clear direction.
