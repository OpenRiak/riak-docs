Thanks Sean. I understand as I am seeing the github that so many changes are
being pushed to master. I can wait for few more days leaving you guys focus
on 1.0 release. It looks like I figured out the index specs and prepared for
new changes :)

&gt; Things are in great flux at the moment on master. If you can hang on for a
&gt; few more days, we can answer that a little better later in the week when the
&gt; dust has settled.

&gt;&gt; It looks like riak\\_kv\\_index\\_backend has been removed in the master. I
&gt;&gt; tried, instead, with riak\\_eleveldb\\_backend and noticed there are some
&gt;&gt; changes to the index meta data. Is it possible to brief the changes? I am
&gt;&gt; using riak:localclient and try to understand the new Index query spec.
&gt;&gt; Earlier it used to be [{QueryType, Index\\_Field, [Index\\_Value]}] .
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Senthil
