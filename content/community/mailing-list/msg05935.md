If you're just interested in later finding documents you've stored, would 
secondary indexes be a good fit? Is there a common property by which you'd 
like to load this list of documents?

It gets you out of the business of managing contention for updating the list of 
documents, but still allows you to find them.



There is also the potential I've completely misunderstood your question.

Subject: Store a list of another document?

Hi,

Is there a way to store an array of key or something to other documents? By 
that I have a key and that maps to an array that contains references to many 
other documents/object?

Thanks.

Shuhao
