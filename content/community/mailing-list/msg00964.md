Riak Recap for 8/25 - 8/26

1) For all of you in testing phases, @moonpolysoft offered up some
code that helps when you're clearing out buckets.

Check it out here ---&gt;http://gist.github.com/404645

2) Another snippet for you... If you need a trace of riak\\_client
activity and don't want to change any code, this might help.

3) Basho hacker Kevin Smith (@kevsmith) was on Webpulp.tv to talk
about Riak. This episode hasn't been promoted yet, but it's public, so
I figured I would pass it around.

Check it out here ---&gt; http://vimeo.com/14463521

4) It looks like @roidrage finally made good on his promise to present
on Riak at the Berlin RUG. If you're in or around Berlin on Sept. 2,
go check it out (and bring him a cupcake).

Info here ---&gt;

5) For anyone in Paris, Montreal, or NYC: the awesome team at
Silentale is hiring!

You can also ping @lfp on twitter for more details.

6) @lusis updated his Padrino sample app that uses Riak and Ripple.

For those of you who aren't familiar with Padrino ---&gt; http://www.padrinorb.com/

7) Q --- Anyone using Riak with Rails 3? (from mheld via #riak)

 A --- There are quite a few people, in fact. Take a look at the
contributors on the github project ---&gt;

8) Can you find the Riaks here --&gt; http://www.opscode.com/signup2/

9) Q --- Do you have any production server spec. recommendations?
