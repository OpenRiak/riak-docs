Hi,
I wonder if there is a way to customize the weighting (aka. scoring)
scheme used by Riak Search to sort matching documents, as it is the
case with Xapian for instance (http://xapian.org/docs/sorting.html) or
even Lucene (Similarity class).
As I am not indexing textual documents, I am not interested in a
default probabilistic or VSM model. A basic weighted boolean model
should be much more appropriate.

Cheers,
Emmanuel
