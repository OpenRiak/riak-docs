If someone was to enable m/r jobs in clojure that could be an outstanding 
integration, exactly because clojure represents code as data .. the 
intergration could be so smooth. With JavaScript you have this ugliness of 
putting scripts inside strings that makes it so painful.

Perhaps using clojurescript (clj-&gt;js compiler) w/runtime library installed 
inside riak could do it.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there using Riak with Clojure in some capacity? Or wanting
&gt; to use Riak with Clojure? I was hoping I might borrow a few minutes of
&gt; your time for the betterment of Riak and Clojure. (I'm not afraid to
&gt; use stickers and t-shirts to make it worth your while.)
&gt; 
&gt; If this is you, please email me off-list.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
