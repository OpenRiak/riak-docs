Iirc, "sort()" is by default lexographic in JavaScript so an added 
function is not necessary. The added function is specifically intended 
for a custom sort, ie. numerical.


You could simply do something like:

return v['key'].sort()

Try that out and lemme know if it works as you expect.

Your compare function will need to return a -1, 0 or 1 for less than,
the same or greater than. Luckily javascript allows you
to strings lexicographically so the function is a nice two liner:

function(a, b) {
 if(a == b) return 0;
 return a &gt; b ? 1 : -1;
}

Application:

var reduceSort = function (v, args) {
 return v.sort (function(a, b) {
 if(a['key'] == b['key']) return 0;
 return a['key'] &gt; b['key'] ? 1 : -1;
 });
};

Thank you so much! :-) Worked like a charm.
