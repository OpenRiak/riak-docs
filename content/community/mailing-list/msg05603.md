Hi Elias,

Thank you, this is excellent feedback. I am literally minutes away
from sending out an email to this group soliciting 2i feedback to
help us focus our efforts.

We have a rough idea internally of what we would like to do going forward,
but I'd prefer to gather feedback first before saying too much more.

Thanks,
Rusty

&gt;
&gt; We are currently using search for indexing as we need to perform compound
&gt; queries. After some testing I found that if we could use i2 we probably
&gt; see 4-5x improvements in insert throughput and and 1.5-2x in querying
&gt; times, depending on the query. We can work around the lack of an
&gt; intersection operation (AND), by implementing the filtering in a MR phase.
&gt; My testing shows that is sufficiently performant in many cases. But we
&gt; are in a bind by the lack of a union operation (OR). Executing multiple
&gt; individual exact matches introduces too much latency given that we may have
&gt; hundreds of exact matches in a single query.
&gt;
&gt; A more general solution to the lack of a union operation would be to allow
&gt; multiple "inputs" statements to a MR job, although the the job may have to
&gt; perform some deduplication or just accept dups, depending on how the inputs
&gt; are structured.
&gt;
&gt; If would also be rather handy if the key filter language could be applied
&gt; to matching secondary indexes.
&gt;
