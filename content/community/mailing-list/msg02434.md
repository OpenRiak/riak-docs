How did you install Erlang? It is often broken into several packages and you 
need to have all of them installed (with the exception of wx) for Riak to build 
properly. If you installed Erlang from source we'll look into other 
possibilities.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I was hoping to give riak a try but ran into an odd Erlang issue. I was 
&gt; following the "Fast Track", but got hung up when compiling riak.
&gt; 
&gt; I cloned riak from github, did "cd riak", then "make all". A few modules 
&gt; appeared to compile correctly, but then I received the following error:
&gt; 
&gt; ERROR: compile failed while processing /home/luke/riak/deps/skerl: 
&gt; {'EXIT',{function\\_clause,[{lists,thing\\_to\\_list,[{error,bad\\_name}]},
&gt; {lists,flatmap,2},
&gt; {lists,flatmap,2},
&gt; {rebar\\_port\\_compiler,default\\_env,0},
&gt; {rebar\\_port\\_compiler,compile,2},
&gt; {rebar\\_core,run\\_modules,4},
&gt; {rebar\\_core,execute,4},
&gt; {rebar\\_core,process\\_dir,4}]}}
&gt; make: \\*\\*\\* [compile] Error 1
&gt; 
&gt; I'm running Erlang R14B. I know I'm supposed to have R13B04 or later, but 
&gt; maybe R14B is too new? Also, I'm on Fedora 14, if that's relevant. Any 
&gt; ideas would be appreciated, as I'm really hoping to getting into trying out 
&gt; riak.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Luke
