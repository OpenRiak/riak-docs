Hi all,

Is there difference between "MapReduce in Hadoop" and "MapReduce in RIAK"?
I tested these performances and there were difference even in the same 
machine, same data.

I'd like to know the difference like:

- Version? Which is newer or branched?
- Does RIAK build in on source level or binary?
- Number of performance tuning parameters?
- What else?

Regards,

Ken.
