&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Here is my setup of Riak 1.1.4
&gt; 
&gt; - 5 Nodes
&gt; - ami-a29943cb (EC2 AMI)
&gt; - m1.large (7.5GB Ram, 4 EC2 compute instances)
&gt; - EBS storage
&gt; - LevelDB backend
&gt; - Python Client with Protobuf (on a separate machine)
&gt; 
&gt; While loading data I am getting around 50 ops/sec.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried running basho benchmark on the setup and it showed 100 ops/sec
&gt; throughput.
&gt; 
&gt; After talking to people or Riak IRC, I realized that upwards of 1.5K
&gt; ops/sec is what I should be getting.
&gt; 
&gt; Could anyone help me in figuring out what I am doing wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; 

are your riak nodes located in the same DC?
