We have always intended to have the ability to query multiple indexes at
once, but the feature is not pinned on the roadmap yet. I'm sure there will
be an announcement preceding its release.

&gt; Writing these queries yourself should be pretty trivial. Just spin up n
&gt; threads, query n indexes, and then use some join algorithm [1] to merge the
&gt; result sets together to produce the key list that you need to perform your
&gt; lookups.

&gt;&gt; Are there any plans for allowing Riak to query multiple indices in one
&gt;&gt; operation? If there are, how will these queries work?
