If you've been in security that long, you know that every security measure
has a cost associated. In general, Riak is deployed deep in infrastructure,
and secured in ways that are almost always already in-place for other
purposes. It is almost never exposed to the outside world. The lack of
authentication/authorization/etc has more often been an annoyance
factor than a deal-breaker for our customers.

And if you think we only have startups as customers, you haven't looked
closely -- many of our customers are "big enterprises" and that segment is
the one growing fastest.
