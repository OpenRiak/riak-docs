&gt;&gt; The default for a bucket is to use quorum writes, but you should be able

&gt;&gt; specify that you only want to write to one Riak node as a parameter to the
&gt;&gt; write. So you don't necessarily have to adjust the nval.

&gt;
&gt; Does the client directive actually control the number of writes or just the
&gt; number of acknowledgments it waits for (i.e. does the server side still
&gt; attempt the writes configured for the bucket)?
&gt;

It's acknowledgements I believe. The n\\_val will still control the number of
replicas it tries to make.
