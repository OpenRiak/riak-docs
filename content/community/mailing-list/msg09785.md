Hi Matt,

For stopping and starting rather than rebooting, you need to use
elastic IPs inside of Amazon's virtual private cloud[1] which allows
for persistent static private addresses.

&gt; Using an Elastic IP won't help with AWS since that only binds to the public
&gt; interface - not the internal private one. The hostname command still returns
&gt; the same internal IP address as before, which is what's seen by Riak.
&gt;
&gt; In AWS an internal IP address will actually persist across reboots. It does
&gt; not persist across shutdown and startup.
