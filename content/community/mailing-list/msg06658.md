Hello Riakers,

I am new to Riak/Riak Core. I would like to learn some small-sized
Riak Core examples to learn different aspects of Riak Core.

I found three old examples in the bolg from the blog (Basho Banjo , 4
examples in "try try try", and riak\\_id), but I would like to try more.
 Are there other recommendations?

Lastly, when I wanted to try Basho Banjo &lt;
https://github.com/rustyio/BashoBanjo &gt;, I cannot find the folder
rel/basho\\_banjo. I noticed that the readme file is not updated after
moving to the new repository. Does some one know what's happing here?

With Thanks
Jiansen
