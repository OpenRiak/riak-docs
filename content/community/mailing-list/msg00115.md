&gt; One of the "other options" that I didn't mention was a graph database. If
&gt; your model seems to beg lots and lots of links, you might be better off
&gt; looking at something that fits the traversal model better, like Neo4J,
&gt; AllegroGraph, etc. You could still use Riak for storing the primary
&gt; objects, but keep your tightly interrelated stuff in the graph DB.
&gt; Remember, nosql is about choice and using the best tool for the job!

Well said and very classy of you to point out.
