Hi Robert,

Is a "log/sasl-error.log" file generated? Can you also try "riak console"
and let us know what is output?

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; I'm having problems running riak on a Sun box, system details are as

&gt; SunOS 5.11 snv\\_121
&gt; Erlang R13B04
&gt;
&gt; I've tried both the package install of 0.14.2 and compiled from source
&gt; and despite building/installing correctly, when I run "bin/riak start"
&gt; nothing happens, no instance of beam and no errors to console or any log
&gt; that I can find.
&gt;
&gt; Note that other erlang apps such as RabbitMQ run fine.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas on where to start looking would be greatly appreciated.
