Great, thanks.

&gt; Sorry that the package was
&gt; misconfigured for your environment! 

Hard to cover every possibility. 
The completely silent failure mode made it hard to get traction,
spitting out some sort of error would be helpful, although reliably
detecting this category of problem is potentially non-trivial :-/

&gt; BASHOriak-0.14.2-1-Solaris10-i386.pkg.gz
&gt; package
&gt; correct?

Yes.

&gt; I'm glad you got it all sorted out with Dan's help.

Ditto... looking forward to rolling riak out!

Thanks

Robert
