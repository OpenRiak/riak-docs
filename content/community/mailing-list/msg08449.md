Do you know X in advance?

If yes: have you considered using a backend with timed auto expiry?
Bitcask and HanoiDB both have that.

Bitcask can't be used when you have very many live keys, so if you 
indeed have zillions then that one's out.

HanoiDB has no such limitation, however.
See
https://github.com/basho-labs/riak\\_kv\\_hanoidb\\_backend#how-to-deploy-hanoidb-as-a-riakkv-backend
for installation instructions.
And feel free to get back to me if you need any further help.

(Also, I have experience with running an app inside the Erlang VM 
alongside Riak; at Trifork we've used that in production.)
