Hey jt

We'll work on making those available again (in some equally-usable
format). For the moment this is your best option:

&gt; Hi,
&gt; There are still links to the riak native client edoc's on the wiki but the
&gt; page itself is redirected back to the index.
&gt; I use the native api in my app and have done for a year or more and have
&gt; recently upgraded to 0.14 and wanted to use the edocs to aid in writing some
&gt; new stuff.
&gt; Yes I am aware of the PB client and no I don't want to use it.
&gt; Please put the edocs back.
