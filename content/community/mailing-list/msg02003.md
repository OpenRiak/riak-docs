I've always gone about it the other way:

dev2/bin/riak-admin join dev1
dev3/bin/riak-admin join dev1

Hasn't failed me yet :-)

Subject: Joining running nodes should be in proper order?
When I join nodes like this:
dev1/bin/riak-admin join dev2@127.0.0.1
dev1/bin/riak-admin join dev3@127.0.0.1

the ring has only 2 nodes: dev1 & dev2. I wait about 30 minutes,
nothing changed.
So I must join the ring nodes in some proper order?
