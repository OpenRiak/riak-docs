OJ Reeves and I are happy to announce that CorrugatedIron (the Riak .NET
client) has reached 1.0. The full announcement is available at
http://corrugatediron.org/blog/v1/, but the highlights are fluent
interfaces for everyone, Riak v1.2.1 feature compatibility, better .NET
Task Parallel Library support, and improved documentation. Get it from
NuGet and give it a whirl!
