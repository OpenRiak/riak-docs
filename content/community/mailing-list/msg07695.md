Hi,

I was testing my application against the latest Riak source from
github (168c2ae67c) and noticed that I'm getting a different response
when putting pre-existing objects into Riak with the if\\_none\\_match
option. The response to riakc\\_pb\\_socket:put(Pid, RiakObj,
[if\\_none\\_match]) was {error, &lt;&lt;"match\\_found"&gt;&gt;} but I'm seeing {error,
{0, &lt;&lt;"match\\_found"&gt;&gt;}}. Is this an expected change? If so what is the
number for (phase or something)?
