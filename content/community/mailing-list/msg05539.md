Hi,
I am trying to install Riak's python client library using Pip. But it
throws an IOError while installing: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or
directory: 'protobuf/setup.py'. Apparently, a lot of guys are facing the
same problem. The problem is that the latest version of Protobuf (2.4.1)
has moved setup.py from /setup.py to /python/setup.py.
There is already an issue raised for Riak:
https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/issues/19.
Any suggestions how to specify correct path of setup.py to Pip?

Cheers
Nitish
