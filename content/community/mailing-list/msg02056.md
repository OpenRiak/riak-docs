Without knowing exactly, I'm gonna go with yes. I happen to be under the 
impression that the merge\\_index\\_backend is a bitcask derivative. But I would 
love to hear otherwise from someone @basho.

&gt; Greetings All,
&gt; 
&gt; It is my understanding the only backend that is compatible with Riak Search 
&gt; indexes is the merge\\_index\\_backend.
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering if merge\\_index backend has a similar memory footprint as 
&gt; bitcask; i.e., must the keydir structure for merge\\_index fit entirely in RAM 
&gt; as is the case with bitcask?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks!
