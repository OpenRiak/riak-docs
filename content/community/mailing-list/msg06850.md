Riak Recap for February 27 - March 1
===========================

1) Basho put out a press release about Bump running on Riak.

\\* Read here ---&gt; http://basho.com/news/riak\\_strategic\\_for\\_bump/

2) Bump picked up some additional Riak-related press from some big sites.

\\* Write up on GigaOM ---&gt;

\\* Piece in Silicon Alley ---&gt;

3) More good news from the Community: Yammer closed $85MM in funding.

4) Jim Downey wrote two great blog posts over the last week that are
worth your time.

\\* Exploring NoSQL and CAP with Riak ---&gt;

\\* Eventual Consistency: How Eventual? How Consistent? ---&gt;
http://jimdowney.net/2012/03/01/eventual-consistency-how-eventual-how-consistent

5) Jim's "Eventual Consistency" post was inspired by a talk Peter
Bailis gave at BashoChats last week in San Francisco. We just posted
Peter's talk on the Basho blog, and it's well worth your 45 minutes.

6) Liam Kaufman put together a blog post about Riak and Node.js.

7) So more Riak love at Erlang Factory to pass along: Jesse Newland is
giving a talk called "Rewriting GitHub Pages with Riak Core, Riak KV,
and Webmachine."
