I'm playing with riak to see what it's good for, so I need to ask:

Sean Cribbs wrote:
&gt; To understand why listing keys is difficult, you have to understand Riak's 
&gt; (and Dynamo's) original design motivations:
&gt; 
&gt; \\* To be basically available at all times for reads and writes, which in turn 
&gt; means to be tolerant of machine and network failures.
&gt; \\* To provide low-latency random access to large data sets. (Note I didn't say 
&gt; an entire data set.)
&gt; \\* To scale linearly with minimal operational complexity.

This begs the question: so how DO people know their keys, in practice?
Apart from trivial cases like including those keys in pregenerated HTML
pages, so when user clicks the link, riak is queried for that key?

Do people generate their keys from some templates, like searching a
bucket "city-zip\\_code" would generate a range of keys like
"london\\_w2qsomething" to "london\\_somethingelse" ?

This may look silly to you, but I'm trying to get to grips with idea how
riak is \\*actually used\\* in querying.
