Hi Matt,

Thanks for your feedback. The node was back after some time and then
crashed again and again, probably something became corrupted.
I solved it by brute force - (a) Forced remove of node from the cluster (b)
Delete of all files under bitcask and ring folders of node (c) restart of
node (d) add node to cluster from Riak Control.
Now it is ok.

Thanks,
 Pavel

&gt; Have you run "riak console" on the server to see what the output is? Could
&gt; you paste that here? I'm no expert, but I may be able to help diagnose a
&gt; problem with the node starting.

&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am running couple of months cluster of 5 Riak nodes on CentOs (Bitcask
&gt;&gt; backend).
&gt;&gt; Till today everything was fine, but today one of the nodes just stopped
&gt;&gt; to work.
&gt;&gt; When trying riak start/stop/ ... it just claims that node doesn't respond
&gt;&gt; to pings.
&gt;&gt; Restart of server didn't help. What should I do to recover this node?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Pavel
