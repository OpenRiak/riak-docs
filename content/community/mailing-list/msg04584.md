Hi ,

I have set\\* r ,w , dw \\*through \\*app.config\\* file . When i display property
of that bucket it's showing me

r ,w, dw at two places i.e

{"props":{"name":"test1","\\*n\\_val":2,"r":2,"w":2,"dw":2\\*,"linkfun":

{"mod":"riak\\_kv\\_wm\\_link\\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\\_linkfun"},"old\\_vclock":86400,"young\\_vclock":20,"big\\_vclock":50,"small\\_vclock":10,
\\*"r":"quorum","w":"quorum","dw":"quorum","rw":"quorum"\\*}}


This is part of my app.config file

%% Riak Core config
 {riak\\_core, [
 //some other part

 {default\\_bucket\\_props, [{n\\_val,2},{r,2},{w,2},{dw,2}]}
 ]},

Is It right way to set r ,w , dw in app.config file ?
