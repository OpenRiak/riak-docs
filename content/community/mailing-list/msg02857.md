I do know about this bug https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=965 though I 
wonder if I'm really encountering it.

I've got 3 nodes running, one of the nodes always answers fine with json output 
- the other two always answers with the
error below (when encountering certain documents I assume):

Expected 200 from Riak but received 500. 500 Internal Server 
ErrorInternal Server Error
=====================

The server encountered 
an error while processing this request:  

```
{error,{error,badarg,
              [{erlang,list_to_integer,["0028,0100"]},
               {riak_search_utils,to_integer,1},
               {riak_indexed_doc,'-to_mochijson2/2-lc$^0/1-0-',2},
               {riak_indexed_doc,'-to_mochijson2/2-lc$^0/1-0-',2},
               {riak_indexed_doc,to_mochijson2,2},
               {riak_solr_output,'-json_response/7-lc$^0/1-0-',2},
               {riak_solr_output,json_response,7},
               
{riak_solr_searcher_wm,to_json,2}]}}
```

I wonder how this could be? Why would one node answer fine and the other two 
not? I've tried changing the schema in various ways and reindexing
all data but I can't seem to work around this issue. Anyone have an idea of 
whats up with this?

Thanks,
John
