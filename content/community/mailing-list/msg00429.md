Riak Recap for 5/21 - 5/23

1) The beginning pieces of a Riak Protocol Buffers Client written in
Ruby appeared over the weekend (h/t to #scootsm for putting this
together!).

Check it out here ---&gt; http://github.com/aitrus/riak-pbclient

Added to the wiki here --- &gt;

2) Q --- Ok fellas, is it completely absurd to be deploying my own
webmachine resource on each of my riak nodes and using
riak:local\\_client() for everything? (from howboutjoe via #riak)

 A --- If it fits your use case, then no, it's not absurd. One thing
that you should take into account, though, are the security
implications of such a design. As you know, Riak exposes an http
interface, so you would either need to make sure that all of Riak
(including your web service) is only accessible internally or else
you'll need to set up a proxy or something in front of Riak that
blocks calls to the existing http interface.

For more on webmachine see --- &gt; http://bitbucket.org/basho/webmachine

3) Q --- Does ripple support many linked associations yet? Is this a
todo list item? (from TheRiffer via #riak)

 A --- Associations are in fact a todo. It's a work in progress at
the moment.

4) jdrowell and bingledac had a great convo in #riak yesterday about
innostore and setting N, R, and W values.

5) The "Weekend Tweet Award" goes out to @argv0 for this gem:
