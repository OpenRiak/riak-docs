Ah, ok - the github project gave me the impression you could bolt it into 1.0.2.
Have built a ring using HEAD and it's working now, thanks.

&gt; changes within riak\\_core for riak\\_control. Control might compile just fine
&gt; (and better! ;-)), but much tof the functionality it would need doesn't
&gt; exist in prior versions.

&gt; Have tried shoehorning this into a 1.0.2 . The github docs seem to assume
&gt; you already know how to extend risk, and I don't.
&gt;
&gt; Even without a t-shirt bribe :) am still curious what I'm missing here.
&gt; https
&gt; listener is up, but I don't have anything under /admin (and riak
&gt;
&gt; have got rebar to build the riak\\_control project, copied the built project
&gt; into the lib/ folder within the riak installation
&gt;
&gt; (
&gt; riak-1.0.2:$ ls -d lib/r\\*
&gt; lib/riak\\_control lib/riak\\_kv-1.0.2 lib/riak\\_search-1.0.2 lib/riakc-1.2.0
&gt; lib/riak\\_core-1.0.2 lib/riak\\_pipe-1.0.2 lib/riak\\_sysmon-1.0.0
&gt; lib/runtime\\_tools-1.8.5
&gt; riak-1.0.2:$
&gt; )
&gt; and added a block to my app.config
&gt; (between the riak\\_core and riak\\_kv config blocks, see below) but the
&gt; module isn't loading up
&gt; after I stop/start the node:
&gt;
&gt; riak-1.0.2:$ ./bin/riak-admin status | grep riak\\_control
&gt;
&gt; is there an extra step?
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; ...
&gt;              {platform\\_log\\_dir, "./log"}
&gt;             ]},
&gt;
&gt; %% riak control bit
&gt; {riak\\_control, [
&gt;              {enabled, true},
&gt;              {auth, none},
&gt;              {admin, true}
