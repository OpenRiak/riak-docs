Riak Search 0.14.0 Release Notes
--------------------------------

The majority of effort during development of Riak Search 0.14 went
toward rewriting the query parsing and planning system. This fixes all
known query planning bugs. We also managed to add quite a few new
features and performance improvements. See the highlights below for
details.

Important Configuration and Interface Changes:

- The system now uses the 'whitespace\\_analyzer\\_factory' by
 default. (It previously used the 'default\\_analyzer\\_factory', which
 has been renamed to 'standard\\_analyzer\\_factory'.)

- Indexing and searching will fail with an error message if the
 analyzer\\_factory configuration setting is not set at either a schema
 or field level.

- The method signature for custom Erlang and Javascript extractors has
 changed.

Highlights:

- Fixed the query parser to properly respect field-level analyzer
 settings.

- Fixed the query parser to correctly handle escaped special
 characters and terms within single-quotes and double-quotes.

- Fixed the query parser's interpretation of inclusive and exclusive
 ranges, allowing an inclusive range on one side, and an exclusive
 range on the other (mimicking Lucene).

- Fixed the execution engine to significantly speed up proximity
 searches and phrase searches. (678)

- By default new installations use all Erlang-based extractors, and
 the JVM is not started. Setting the analysis\\_port in etc/app.config
 will cause the JVM to start and allow the use of Java Lucene-based
 analyzers.

- System now aborts queries that would queue up too many documents in
 a result set. This is controlled by a 'max\\_search\\_results' setting
 in riak\\_search. Note that this only affects the Solr
 interface. Searches through the Riak Client API that feed into a
 Map/Reduce job are still allowed to execute because the system
 streams those results.

- Change handoff of Search data stored in merge\\_index to be more
 memory efficient.

- Added "\\*\\_date", "\\*\\_int", "\\*\\_text", and "\\*\\_txt" dynamic fields to the
 default schema.

------------
Improvements
------------

414 - ETS backend now fully functional (415, 795)
592 - Make parser multi-schema aware
783 - Pass Search Props as KeyData to Map/Reduce Query
788 - Add support for indexing Erlang terms / proplists
839 - Create a way to globally clear schema cache
925 - Change search-cmd commands (set\\_schema, etc.) to use dashes.
