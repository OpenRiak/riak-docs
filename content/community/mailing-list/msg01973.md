It looks like the wiki is a little light on content relating to
security/access control, and it's come up enough times on the list and
in IRC to warrant its own page.

So, I just started a stub for a page called "Deploying Riak" that will
live under the Best Practices section of the wiki. As you'll see it
needs some fleshing out, so if you have any suggestions or content to
add, please offer them up or fork away and add them yourself.

It's in this branch here: https://github.com/basho/riak\\_wiki/tree/deploying-riak
