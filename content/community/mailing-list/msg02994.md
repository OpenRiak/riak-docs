Sean,

The problem seems to have been HTTP overhead, even though I was running 11 
processes. Using procotol buffers yielded a much better (and realistic) 
performance around ~2900 inserts/second. Please see my previous response in 
this same thread for more info.

Thank you,
Jens

Jens,

Based on the numbers you shared for latencies (http://pastebin.com/L1mwThPA), 
it seems you are not maxing out the cluster. I'd suggest running your inserts 
in multiple client processes or on multiple machines to get greater throughput.
