Hi Ted,

Documentation for the REST API can be found here:
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/REST+API


Regarding the failed requests, can you show us the various requests you are
making via curl along with the responses?

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Does Riak have an HTTP API doc ( similar to the CouchDB one found
&gt; here: http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP\\_Document\\_API )?
&gt;
&gt; The closest thing I can find is the Riak Fast Track (
&gt; https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/The+Riak+Fast+Track ). But that
&gt; is in curl only rather than explicit HTTP headers.
&gt;
&gt; In particular, I have a problem with the PUT request in the following
&gt; curl command
&gt;
&gt; $ curl -v -X PUT -d '{"bar":"baz"}' -H "Content-Type:
&gt; application/json" -H "X-Riak-Vclock:
&gt; a85hYGBgzGDKBVIszMk55zKYEhnzWBlKIniO8mUBAA=="
&gt; http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true
&gt;
&gt; I try to convert the command into HTTP headers but the request fails
&gt; when the followin is attempted :
&gt;
&gt; a) include {"bar":"baz"} in the body and set the Content-Type header
&gt; to application/json
&gt; b) same as a) but add another Content-Type header value - this time
&gt; of application/x-www-form-urlencoded ( inspired by the info on the
&gt; -d command found in the following curl manual
&gt; http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html )
&gt; c) same as b) but instead of placing {"bar":"baz"} in the body, add
&gt; ampersand in the url and bar=baz
&gt; http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true&bar=baz
&gt;
&gt; I tried looking for an equivalent to the Live HTTP Headers extension
&gt; on Firefox but which would capture activity from curl commands. Then,
&gt; I could get a better idea of how to formulate the HTTP headers.
&gt;
&gt; Please Help...
&gt;
&gt; if there is an HTTP API doc with explicity header request info
&gt;
&gt; how to formulate this particular PUT request with the HTTP headers
&gt;
&gt; good ubuntu linux utility for capturing http activity even if not from
&gt; browser application
&gt;
