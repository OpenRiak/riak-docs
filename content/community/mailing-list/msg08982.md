So... no answers.
I guess there are no smart minds at Basho working on M/R currently. Too
bad, but I guess a company has to choose its priority.

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; as part of my evaluation of Riak, I am looking at the M/R capabilities and
&gt; I have several questions:
&gt; 1/ the doc states that " Riak MapReduce is intended for batch processing,
&gt; not real-time querying." But as of now, you always get the results and
&gt; cannot automatically store them in a bucket like you would do with MongoDB
&gt; for example. Is taht something that is on the roadmap?
&gt; 2/ Basho blog has two articles from last year on Hadoop on top of Riak. Is
&gt; this project still live? It is on github, so I can always dig it up and
&gt; work on it, but I am wondering if there is something like Yokozuna for
&gt; Hadoop integration.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
