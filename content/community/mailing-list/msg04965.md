Hi,

I just starting to use Riak and have following situation:

I want to store some JSON documents inside Riak. After updating document I
want to save new copy in the same bucket with the link to the "parent"
revision.

Then my task is to retrieve all revisions for the specified document.
However I didn't find any examples how to do this if I don't know the depth
of the tree (amount of revisions), there are just examples hot to achieve
first linked document or second. Do you have any hints?

One more question: are there any patterns for storing versioned objects
inside Riak? Any previous discussion on this list?

P.S. Since probably these question was asked previously can you suggest a
way how to make search over this mailing list? I see archive (
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\\_lists.basho.com/) but don't
know how to search it.

Thank you in advance!

Best regards,
Anton Podviaznikov
