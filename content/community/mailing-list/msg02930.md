Riak folks,

I see that storing an object without a key is supported in the HTTP 
APIs(http://wiki.basho.com/REST-API.html#Store-a-new-object-without-a-key), but 
not  in the PBC APIs(http://wiki.basho.com/PBC-API.html) or the python 
client(http://basho.github.com/riak-python-client/).

Is there a reason why this is so?

We're planning to use the ID generated by Riak as the identifier in the system, 
and ideally wouldn't want to use HTTP APIs for creation, and PBC APIs for 
read/updates.
