Hey Joel,

I can't speak to which templates to use, but the error you are seeing is
happening because you have a line with {boot\\_rel, "freqserver"} but no
corresponding {rel, "freqserver", "x.x.x", []} release configuration.''

Again, I apologize that I don't have a full answer to the questions you are
asking, but hopefully this helps you some in tracking down the issue. You
can find more on reltool.config here
http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/reltool.html if you haven't looked already.

Best of luck,

Jeff

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I've got a riak\\_core application based on 0.13.0 that I'm updating to
&gt; riak\\_core 1.0. In the process, I thought I'd try moving it from framewerk
&gt; to rebar. For my initial attempt I used the riak\\_core template, but when I
&gt; tried to build a release with reltool I got the following error:
&gt;
&gt; [root@rocky:experimental/freqserver]# rebar generate
&gt; ==&gt; rel (generate)
&gt; {"init terminating in do\\_boot","Release freqserver uses non existing
&gt; application freqserver"}
&gt;
&gt; This got me looking at the differences between the riak\\_core template and
&gt; the riak\\_core\\_multinode template. It looks like the riak\\_core template puts
&gt; src in the src/ dir (and doesn't include things like the handoff-handlers,
&gt; etc) while the multinode template puts src in apps/{{app\\_id}}/ and includes
&gt; more things. Could someone shed some light on when to use which template?
&gt; My application is currently deployed on more than one node (84 currently).
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joel
&gt;
