Records inserted into a bucket are not reflected when read in a different
request while using java riak client (even when both read and write are in
quorum level).

Code fragment for Write:
 Bucket bucket = .fetchBucket(table).execute();
 IRiakObject riakObject =
RiakObjectBuilder.newBuilder(table,key).withValue(new
JSONObject(valueMap).toString()).build();
 riakObject.setContentType("application/json");
 bucket.store(riakObject).dw(Quora.QUORUM).execute();


Code fragment for Read:
 Bucket bucket = .fetchBucket(table).execute();
 IRiakObject fetched = bucket.fetch(key).r(Quora.QUORUM).execute();

Number of nodes in riak-server-cluster:3
Riak Client Version : 1.4.0

All the default properties of the buckets are retained as it is.

Am I missing anything else? Kindly help me out.
