&gt; Hey riak-users,
&gt; 
&gt; We've just officially released the official Riak Python Client,
&gt; version 1.5.0, to pypi.python.org. The primary updates in this release
&gt; are related to Riak 1.2 compatibility, so if you're using Riak 1.2,
&gt; this is an important upgrade. Our apologies for the delay on this
&gt; release.
&gt; 
&gt; As always, please report bugs, issues, and enhancements on Github:
