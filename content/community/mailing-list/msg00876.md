4) SamuraiJack, jospeph\\_sh, and nfo had a quick chat about how best to
use Riak's for certain use case

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/521438

5) Q --- Does riak do some crazy automatic updating of links when you
move stuff around? Or maybe when you delete things? or maybe do links
go both ways? (from makmanalp via #riak)

 A --- No updating is done. Links are static, and and they not go both ways.

8) Q --- Does the python client have a list-keys equivalent? I'm
looking to create a maintenance script for nuking a bucket. (from
makmana via #riak)

 A --- There is an open issue to add list\\_keys to the Python
Client. You can track it here ---&gt;
