I believe you need to have mercurial installed. I think rebar looks for it even 
though the primary repos are in git now.

&gt; Did you pull down the riak sources by cloning the github repo or did you just

&gt; &gt; Hi I've been able to get riak funning using brew but getting some glitches

&gt; &gt; any. Here is the error I'm getting:
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Obviously it's looking for something that's not there... what libs need to 
&gt; &gt; be installed or present in the build package for this to work ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,
