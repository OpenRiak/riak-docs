Thanks to everyone who made this possible. I know what I'm doing tonight:
Cool ranch Doritos and RICON videos.

&gt; Hey All,
&gt;
&gt; I was going to put this in the Recap but it didn't seem right...
&gt;
&gt; The first round of RICON videos are now online:

&gt;
&gt; We'll be rolling out four/week for the next five weeks or so - only
&gt; because Vimeo allows us no more than 5GB/week for uploads :(
&gt;
&gt; Enjoy. There are some awesome talks up already, including Andrew
&gt; Thompson's and Joseph Blomstedt's.
