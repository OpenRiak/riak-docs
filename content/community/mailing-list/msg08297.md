Hi Sean,

How soon is "soon"? In other words when can we expect a new
riak-erlang-client with this fix? Will it be tied to a release
of riak or can the client be released separately? Or is it in
the last tagged version (1.3.0), but undocumented?

Thanks,

-Anthony

&gt; &gt; Hi folks,
&gt; &gt; The wiki on client libs (http://wiki.basho.com/Client-Libraries.html) 
&gt; &gt; indicates that the protocol buffer-based erlang library (riakc) only 
&gt; &gt; supports emulated (and not native) search.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can someone explain the difference between 'emulated' and 'native'?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
