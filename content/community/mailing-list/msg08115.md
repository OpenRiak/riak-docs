this is on a single node and my ring\\_creation\\_size is 64.

ring\\_num\\_partitions : 64
ring\\_ownership : &lt;&lt;"[{'riak@127.0.0.1',64}]"&gt;&gt;
ring\\_creation\\_size : 64

Thanks,
Tony

&gt; Hi Antonio,
&gt;
&gt; How many nodes do you have in your cluster? What is
&gt; the ring size ({ring\\_creation\\_size, N} in app.config)?
&gt; Are you seeing 3.6GB of memory used \\_per\\_ machine,
&gt; or total across the cluster?

&gt;&gt; I am using Riak as the persistence data store for a distributed data
&gt;&gt; grid so I really do not care to use Riak's or in my case eLevelDb's
&gt;&gt; cache. The problem I have is that when I load 10 million keys into
&gt;&gt; Riak it is taking 3.6g of memory. I have not set any of the eLevelDb
&gt;&gt; backend configuration parameters therefore I expect Riak to use the
&gt;&gt; defaults specified in the documentation. My bucket name is 7
&gt;&gt; characters and my keys are 7 characters. Any ideas on how to make
&gt;&gt; Riak/eLevelDb use as little memory as possible?
