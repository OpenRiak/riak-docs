This is probably an FAQ but I was unable to find an answer so hopefully
there will be some patient people.

 

The "Quick Start" builds a simple cluster all on the same machine (called
dev1, dev2, and dev3). It assigns the ports, IP addresses, etc. I would like
to do something similar but I would like the cluster to startup
automatically. What do I need to add to the configuration file so that all
of the joins etc. happen on startup? This would be a Ubuntu Server if it
makes any difference.

 

Thank you.

 

Kevin
