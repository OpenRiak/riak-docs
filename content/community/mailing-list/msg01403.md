Hi,

I was wondering if anyone might have an example of how to use a
javascript Map function from Ruby which uses a specific date time.
For example, I'd like to find the accounts which haven't been charged
in over a month.

When I do something like the following:

http://gist.github.com/654246

it looks as if everything on the javascript side is a string. I was
hoping someone might have an example I might learn from.


Thanks!
