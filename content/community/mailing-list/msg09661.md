Jimmy, if you're trying to install via pip, you need to pip install
protobuf first to get things to work. There's a patch in the works
that should fix this shortly.

&gt; Is the http://basho.github.com/riak-python-client/ what you're trying to
&gt; use? What are the problems you're getting when you're trying to compile?

&gt;&gt; Hi guys,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyone using Appfog to connect to riak using python?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am having problems with compilation protobuf when it tried to install
&gt;&gt; the python client.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyway around this apart from using HTTP directly via urllib / etc ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt; James.
