&gt; &gt; Hi Seth,

&gt; &gt; That option is supported by OS X however it is only enabled if
&gt; COMMAND\\_MODE is set as unix2003. This is set by default in Apple's Terminal
&gt; application but not in iTerm:
&gt;
&gt; That's quite interesting. I still think it makes sense to apply a
&gt; small patch since there is nothing essential that -f is doing for this
&gt; purpose and OS X and iTerm are not an uncommon dev environment. I've
&gt; been using that combo for a number of years and this is the first I've
&gt; heard of COMMAND\\_MODE (maybe I'm doing it all wrong :-P ).
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
&gt; + seth
