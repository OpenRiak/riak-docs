Riak Recap for April 20 - 21
=====================

1) Jon Brisbin wrote a piece for the Springsource blog (that
originally appeared on his personal blog) called "Eventing Data With
Riak and RabbitMQ." As you can probably guess, this one talks a lot
about the work he's been doing getting Riak and RabbitMQ to play nice
together and its potential uses.

2) Version 0.15 of the Perl client developed and used by Franck Cuny,
Robin Edwards, and Linkfluence team was just released.

\\* Details here ---&gt; http://search.cpan.org/~rge/Net-Riak-0.15/

3) Some more evidence that Erlang Factory London is going to be
downright amazing: Kresten Krab Thorup will be giving a talk called
"Bringing Riak to the Mobile Platform." Riak Mobile is a component
that can be embedded into your iOS or Android application to make it a
full Riak replication-aware peer...
