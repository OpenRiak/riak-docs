Thanks for suggestions. From what I understand, just use JSON for now, if
needed use PB for performance. Also, which is data format is faster during
Riak Search PB/JSON

I am sorry this is digressing from Riak. But when sending JSON I do have
encode to base64 to send binary data(images etc) which will increase
payload. Is there better way to send binary data between AJAX clients?
