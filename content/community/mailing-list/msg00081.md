I am looking to use Riak as a data store for events in our system.
Namely, I have a handful of event types now and anticipate much more
later.

Consider the following "event":

{
 "type" : "bws.stats",
 "host" : "10.1.55.101",
 "description" : "human friendly description",
 "details" : "string or Object",
 "timestamp" : 1234567890,
 "status" : "SUCCESS|FAIL"
}

A JavaScript client will retrieve events and display them on a webpage
and filter the data based on:

1) show just one event type
2) show all events for a given host
3) show all events for last Wednesday
4) show all events that had a status of SUCCESS
5) show the 10 events before a specific FAIL that matches the same host and type

There are other ways that we plan to query the data, but I think you
get the idea.

The event data payload is flexible if the above is not optimal for Riak.

Thoughts on how to best implement in Riak?
