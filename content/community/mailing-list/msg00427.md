&gt; Hey All,

&gt; As promised, here is the blog post on Riak Search.

&gt; 
&gt; Nice. Thanks for the update Mark. 
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like you're using Java in places (e.g., Lucene analyzers). Is that 
&gt; assumption correct? I saw John mention work of an Erlang NIF to run an 
&gt; embedded JVM. Probably unrelated but one has to wonder.

Yes. We're using Java to avoid reinventing the wheel in certain respects. We 
aren't planning to embed the JVM inside of Erlang. All Java processes will run 
external to Riak.
