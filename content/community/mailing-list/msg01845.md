Hey Bruce,

Without knowing too much about what a JCA wrapper would entail, it
\\_might\\_ be worthwhile to take a quick look at the work that Jon
Brisbin has done with Spring Riak --
https://github.com/jbrisbin/spring-riak. Other than that, I would say
hack away. I don't doubt that there are others who would find this
code useful.

Thanks,

Mark

&gt; Most of my day-to-day programming involves using a Weblogic application

&gt; particular external system like a database.  This would allow the
&gt; application server to manage connections to Riak and make it more efficient
&gt; for programs running within the app server.  That's the theory anyway...
&gt;
&gt; I am experimenting with JCA in general and considered building a JCA wrapper
&gt; for Riak.  I searched the message logs and other resources and it doesn't
&gt; look like anyone else is doing this.
&gt;
&gt; Is there anyone else that might be interested in testing this when I'm
&gt; done?  if it works, I will contribute it.
