Hi Everyone,

I was going to post this in IRC, but thought the mailing-list would be better.


Having Rails 3.0.0 (and Bundler 1.0.0) released, and seeing Sean's nearly 
realtime update of Ripple, I'm inspired to restart working on a shelved Rails3 
+ Ripple project. I've made some good progress, even got my Rails 3 app to 
working with Ripple and Inherited-Resources.

I am now turning to getting my test tooling setup and have a few questions:

\\* Did the "delete all object by bucket" feature make any headway? The specific 
use-case for me is to (quickly) rollback to a fresh, predictable database for 
testing (rspec, cucumber). With RDBMSs, using transactions and not committing 
works nicely. I was thinking of forking and patching 
http://github.com/bmabey/database\\_cleaner to support Riak.

\\* I forked and started playing with http://github.com/seancribbs/riak-qc.js. 
Is there any more documentation or examples (BTW, the example in the README has 
'describe("Property...', I think it ought to be 'define("Property...'). Or are 
there any other tools that could help TDD'ing custom M/R functions?

\\* Is anyone else working on Ripple + Rails 3?

Thanks!
