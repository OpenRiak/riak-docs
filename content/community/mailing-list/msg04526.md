&gt; In an off-list email (as Jonathan knows), I equated it to saying "You should 
&gt; never do RDBMS development without a big enterprise grade server with $500k 
&gt; of SAN behind it." I typically say to build a dev environment that is as 
&gt; close to production as will give you production-like performance. Putting 3 
&gt; nodes on my crappy stock laptop HDD isn't going to give me anything remotely 
&gt; like a production environment (wellâ€¦ there is always EC2 performance).
&gt;
&gt; We see these questions a lot on the list and I don't feel that telling 
&gt; clients "Well, it's gonna suck until you get it into production" isn't the 
&gt; best possible answer. A lot of people seem to be developing on 3-node 
&gt; clusters made out of Mac Minis, HP micro servers, and EC2; but even more 
&gt; people seem to be developing on laptops and wondering why they're seeing 
&gt; horrible performance.

How do you test the inconsistent states you will see in production
when you develop with a one-node cluster? Or, for that matter on a
3-node cluster on the same box where partitioning isn't going to
happen without some unusual intervention to emulate it?
