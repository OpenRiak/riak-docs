Sean -

Thanks for the speedy reply!

Unfortunately, we're not using bundler on this project, and that decision is 
beyond my control.

Yes, changing the gemspec would be great. I have no preference as to whether 
or not to permit the use of builder v2, but I would imagine if it works with v2 
it might as well continue to be permitted.

Not my call, though, and maybe there's a good reason to require 3+.

I just submitted the issue to Github. It's at 
https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/issues/216.

Thanks again,
Keith

&gt; Are you using bundler to manage your dependencies? It should resolve that for 
&gt; you. That said, I'm open to fixing the gemspec such that you don't run into 
&gt; that problem (or requiring &gt;= 3). Please file an issue on the github 
&gt; tracker: https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/issues
