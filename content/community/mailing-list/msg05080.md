There should be an "X-Riak-Deleted" header in the tombstoned object.

Thanks,

&gt; It seems to me that occasional tombstone siblings may occur in the case

&gt; put.
&gt;
&gt; If this is the case, there appears to be no way to differentiate a sibling
&gt; which intentionally has no content from a tombstone. Is that correct?

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Look at the answers to my question "Delete takes 5 seconds in RIAK 1.0
&gt; ??"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And I actually found that the tombstone seemed to be able to live
&gt; forever.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The tombstone is nearly treated as an existing object.

&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: empty sibling after a DELETE then PUT
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What I am trying to model is a concurrent DELETE and a concurrent PUT
&gt; &gt; where both operations use the same source VClock. When I do a GET
&gt; &gt; after those concurrent operations is an object with two siblings; One
&gt; &gt; blank and one with the data.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is the reconciliation of those two values, the responsibility of the
&gt; &gt; application and if so, do we need to treat empty bodies as tombstones?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Eric.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Eric,
&gt; &gt;&gt; What you are seeing is probably a result of some changes we've made to
&gt; &gt;&gt; deletes. After you issue the DELETE, Riak creates a tombstone object
&gt; first
&gt; &gt;&gt; and then removes it. 1.0 now adds a delay of 3s by default. If you do
&gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt; get during that time you should see an X-Riak-Vclock line for the 404
&gt; &gt;&gt; message after the delete.
&gt; &gt;&gt; If you use that vclock with the put then the tombstone will be removed.
&gt; The
&gt; &gt;&gt; feature wasn't well publicized so has not made it into the clients yet.
&gt; &gt;&gt; There should be more info to follow on deletes soon. If you really
&gt; want
&gt; &gt;&gt; the old behavior, add {delete\\_mode, immediate} to the riak\\_kv section of
&gt; &gt;&gt; your app.config

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If I enabled allow\\_multi on a bucket and do I DELETE followed by a PUT
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I am getting a 300 response with one sibling having the body of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; PUT and a second sibling with an empty body. If that the expected
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; behavior?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I wrote a script that would start with a reconciled value. Get the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; VClock of the current value. Then do every permutation of a PUT with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (Pv) and without (P) the VClock and a DELETE with (Dv) and without (D)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the vClock and I see the following result:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Pv Dv 404
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Dv Pv 300
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Pv D 404
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; D Pv 300
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Is it expected that a delete creates a blank sibling like that and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; therefore we should treat empty body's as deleted?
