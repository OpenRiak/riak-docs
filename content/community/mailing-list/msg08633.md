Well, should be something else. I tried both ways and it still doesn't work.
Can be blocked by firewall? I am not Linux expert.

Thanks,
 Pavel

&gt; &gt; If your not directly on the server then you need to change the 0.0.0.0
&gt; to your server actual IP address then put in https://your\\_ip:8069/adminin 
&gt; your local browser - of course after restarting riak.

&gt; &gt; However Riak is running on Linux server without Gnome/KDE.

&gt; &gt; Hi fellows,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have cluster of 2 physical Riak nodes (I know it is not enough)
&gt; running on CentOS 6.
&gt; &gt; Now I am trying to configure Riak control - did everything according to
&gt; instructions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) Enabled HTTPS in app.config
&gt; &gt; {https, [{"0.0.0.0", 8069 }]}
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Don't you need to change 0.0.0.0 to your systems IP adddress?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) Generated SSL certificate using this instructions like a parrot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) Enabled SSL in app.config
&gt; &gt; {ssl, [
&gt; &gt; {certfile, "/etc/riak/server.csr"},
&gt; &gt; {cacertfile, "/etc/riak/server.crt"},
&gt; &gt; {keyfile, "/etc/riak/server.key"}
&gt; &gt; ]},
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4) Enabled riak control in app.config for user guest
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 5) Restarted Riak on same node with riak stop + riak start
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Trying to browse from my PC https://server\\_ip:8069/admin without any
&gt; success.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; With 0.0.0.0 you should try https://127.0.0.1:8069/admin
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what/where can be the problem?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
