Hi Justin,

Thanks for your reply,

I might try wrapping a http api around this erlang implementation of paxos
[1] just for fun.

Kind Regards

Neville

&gt; &gt; Are there any plans for a Distributed Lock Service for Riak, to allow for
&gt; &gt; apps that \\*need\\* locking for some KV ?
&gt;
&gt; It has been discussed and agreed that it would be interesting, but
&gt; there is nothing currently being developed in the short term to
&gt; provide this service integrally to Riak. If you application needs
&gt; locking, some part of it other than Riak will need to provide that
&gt; functionality.
