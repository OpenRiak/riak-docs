Or if I could take a look at your mock system, maybe I could help with
some suggestions for moving in the direction I proposed? We are
generally trying to move toward more well-defined APIs (such as
PBC/HTTP) and to discourage people from using distributed Erlang to
interact with Riak.


Are these going to expose any of the server distribution to clients 
using PBC/HTTP? It just seems odd that an inherently 
distributed/masterless system requires an intermediate load 
balancer/fail over mechanism instead of having clients that know/learn 
how to round-robin and retry on their own.
