I've seen users show concern of Bitcask's space usage overhead. How does
that compare against LevelDB?
Would LevelDB be a good solution for log data?

If using a Level backend, what advantages do we lose of Bitcask? ls
replication & availability an issue at all?

&gt; &gt; and the Google Code page both suggest that it will have a much more

&gt;
&gt; I don't think we've officially measured it; in my own tests, it's
&gt; quite small. A 10GB dataset was within a few MB of what I expected.
&gt; Certainly FAR more efficient than Inno (where I've seen 2-3x).
