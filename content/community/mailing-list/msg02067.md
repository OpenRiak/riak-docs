&gt;As of Riak 0.14 your m/r can filter on key name. I would highly recommend
that your data architecture take this into account by using keys that have
meaningful names.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This will allow you to not scan every key in your cluster.
Is this part true?

I understood that key filtering just means you dont have to fetch the
'value' from the backend (bitcask or innostore). How would it help wrt to
scanning every key? Without a 'secondary index/set' somewhere, you would
still need to scan every key in the cluster to find all the keys that match
your filter.

Kind Regards

&gt; Hi Thomas,
&gt;
&gt; This is a topic that has come up many times. Lemme just hit a couple of
&gt; high notes in no particular order:
&gt;
&gt; - If you must do a list keys op on a bucket, you must must must use
&gt; "?keys=stream". True will block on the coordinating node until all nodes
&gt; return their keys. Stream will start sending keys as soon as the first node
&gt; returns.
&gt;
&gt; - "list keys" is one of the most expensive native operations you can
&gt; perform in Riak. Not only does it do a full key scan of all the keys in your
&gt; bucket, but all the keys in your cluster. It is obnoxiously expensive and
&gt; only more so as the number of keys in your cluster grows. There has been
&gt; discussions about changing this but everything comes with a cost (more open
&gt; file descriptors) and I do not believe a decision has been made yet.
&gt;
&gt; -Riak is in no way a relational system. It is, in fact, about as opposite
&gt; as you can get. Incidentally, "select \\*" is generally not recommended in the
&gt; Kingdom of Relations and regarded as wasteful. You need a bit of a mind
&gt; shift from relational world to have success with nosql in general and Riak
&gt; in particular.
&gt;
&gt; -There are no native indices in Riak. By default Riak uses the bitcask
&gt; backend. Bitcask has many advantages but one disadvantage is that all keys
&gt; (key length + a bit of overhead) must fit in ram.
&gt;
&gt; -Do not use "?keys=true". Your computer will melt. And then your face.
&gt;
&gt; -As of Riak 0.14 your m/r can filter on key name. I would highly recommend
&gt; that your data architecture take this into account by using keys that have
&gt; meaningful names. This will allow you to not scan every key in your cluster.
&gt;
&gt; -Buckets are analogous to relational tables but only just. In Riak, you can
&gt; think of a bucket as a namespace holder (it is used as part of the default
&gt; circular hash function) but primarily as a mechanism to differentiate system
&gt; settings from one group of keys to the next.
&gt;
&gt; -There is no penalty for unlimited buckets except for when their settings
&gt; deviate from the system defaults. By settings I mean things like hooks,
&gt; replication values and backends among others.
&gt;
&gt; -One should list keys by truth if one enjoys sitting in parking lots on the
&gt; freeway on a scorching summers day or perhaps waiting in a TSA line at your
&gt; nearest international point of embarkation surrounded by octomom families
&gt; all the while juggling between the grope or the pr0n slideshow. If that is
&gt; for you, use "?keys=true".
&gt;
&gt; -Virtually everything in Riak is transient. Meaning, for the most part (not
&gt; including the 60 seconds or so of m/r cache), there is no caching going on
&gt; in Riak outside of the operating system. Ie. your subsequent queries will do
&gt; more or less the same work as their predecessors. You need to cache your own
&gt; results if you want to reuse them... quickly.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Oh, there's more but I'm pretty jelloed from last night. Welcome to the
&gt; fold, Thomas. Can I call you Tom?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,

&gt; &gt; I've been playing around with riak lately as really my first usage of a
&gt; distributed key/value store. I quite like many of the concepts and
&gt; possibilities of Riak and what it may deliver, however I'm really stuck on
&gt; an issue.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Doing the equivalent of a select \\* from sometable in riak is seemingly
&gt; slow. As a quick test I tried...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://localhost:8098/riak/mytable?keys=true
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Before even iterating over the keys this was unbearably slow already.
&gt; This took almost half a second on my machine where mytable is completely
&gt; empty!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm a little baffled, I would assume that getting all the keys of a table
&gt; is an incredibly common task? How do I get all the keys of a table quickly?
&gt; By quickly I mean a few milliseconds or less as I would expect of even a
&gt; "slow" rdbms with an empty table, even some tables with 1000's of items can
&gt; get all the primary keys of a sql table in a few milliseconds.
