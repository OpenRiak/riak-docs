&gt; Is there a programmatic way to achieve the equivalent of search-cmd

Yes. At startup you could add the 'search' bucket property with a value of
'true'.

curl -XPUT -H 'content-type: application/json' '
http://localhost:8098/riak/foo' -d '{"props":{"search":true}}'

That will cause the pre-commit hook to be added.
