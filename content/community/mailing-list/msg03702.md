I have a three node cluster, and while one node was down, I deleted every key 
in a certain bucket. Then, I started the node that was down, and it joined the 
cluster.

Now, when do a listing on these keys in this bucket, and I get the entire list. 
 I can also get the values of the bucket. However, when I try to delete the 
keys, the keys are not deleted.

Can anyone help me get the nodes back in a consistent state? I have tried 
restarting the nodes.
