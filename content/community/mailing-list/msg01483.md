My calls to riak using the python client are taking upwards of 8-9 seconds to 
return.

Obviously this is some form of error even though the calls still run/work.

I've isolated what I think is the problem (creating the client)

This code takes 7 seconds to return on an dual core mac -

I've reinstalled the python client so I'm not really sure what else I can do..

Suggestions welcome. Thanks in advance.
