&gt; 1. Did you realize that the "log\\_jan.txt" file from #1 below documented a 
hard disk failure?

I did not know about the corruption (I did not know that LevelDB logs are 
human readable application logs), thanks for telling me. I did look at syslog 
and I did not find any traces of a disk failure.

&gt; You mentioned a failed drive once. I am not sure if this is the same drive.

No, it is a different disk. I am not using the problematic node anymore.

&gt; You also discuss a basho\\_bench failure. Is this the same test run as the 
log\\_jan.txt file? The hard drives had their first failure at:

Yes, it is. (It is an application-level test written as a basho\\_bench driver.)

&gt; The next question from me is whether the drive / disk array problems are 
your only problem at this point. 
&gt; The data in log\\_jan.txt looks ok until the failures start. I am willing to 
work more, but I need to better understand your next level of problems.

I will look into it and report back.

Thanks!

Jan
