I understand.
To eliminate any problems related to Bitcask, I changed to Memory backend
and now I can store roughly 80 objs/sec. This speed can be achieved hitting
just one of them.
I tried to hit both of them at same time, and the speed drops to roughly 68
objs/sec (each).
Do you have any suggestion about it?

Thank you.

&gt; You should hit both servers and not just with a concurrency level of 1.
&gt;
&gt; There are many more factors to consider, but these are highly dependent on
&gt; your actual problem (not just a simple benchmark). Just to name a few:
&gt; bitcask settings (
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/choosing-a-backend/Bitcask/#Tuning-Bitcask),
&gt; w-quorum, HTTP vs ProtoBuf, ring\\_creation\\_size, ...

&gt; At the beginning I tried to use the default settings (n\\_val = 3), then I
&gt; started to create the bucket with n\\_val = 2. I've tested a lot of
&gt; combinations to w, but I could not see any substantial improvement.
&gt; If you have any suggestion, please, let me know. I can do any test.

&gt;&gt; What level of concurrency are you using in your test setup? Are you
&gt;&gt; hitting both servers with your test? What is your n\\_val and w?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm new here and with Riak. If I do something wrong, please, let me
&gt;&gt; know.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I've made a Riak cluster with two identical machines: Intel core i3
&gt;&gt; 2.3GHz 4GB RAM 1TB HD. They are connected by a gigabit ethernet network.
&gt;&gt; Everything is working fine. I'm using a Bitcask backend.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I've made a PHP script to do a performance test and find out how fast
&gt;&gt; Riak can be with these settings. What my script is doing is: to store 10000
&gt;&gt; objects with a 10K long data (string of 10240 x 'A'), and calculating how
&gt;&gt; many objects it stores per second.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Right now, using Bitcask backend, it can store roughly 68 objects per
&gt;&gt; second. It seems to be a small number to me, but I don't know too much
&gt;&gt; about Riak. I've tested the same script on a Couchbase cluster, with the
&gt;&gt; same settings, and it could store roughly 1000 objects per second.
&gt;&gt; Obviously, on Couchbase test, the data is not sent to non-volatile media
&gt;&gt; immediately. Data is kept in memory to acknowledge the reception as fast as
&gt;&gt; possible, and is sent to non-volatile media in background. I want Riak to
&gt;&gt; behave the same way to increase the "writing speed", but I don't know how
&gt;&gt; to do it or if it is possible. May be I'm trying to do something completely
&gt;&gt; out of the purpose of Riak.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I've tested Riak with Memory backend too, but it achieved only 72
&gt;&gt; objects per second. I expected it to work faster with Memory backend, cause
&gt;&gt; there is no disk activity involved on it, but the final result is not that
&gt;&gt; high.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Again, I don't know if I'm trying to do something inappropriate. I
&gt;&gt; think I'm missing something.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Is there any way to do it?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; If I could not make myself clear, please, let me know.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thank you.
