&gt; We want to use basic 3 node riak cluster on amazon ec2 with a leveldb

To be clear, for production deployments we recommend using no fewer
than 5 nodes:

&gt; When doing a backup ...
&gt; 1. Do i need to remove the node from the load balancer?

The process for backing up the LevelDB backend can be found here:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Backups/#LevelDB-Backups

&gt; 2. How do i backup riak using nodejs? Can i run a cron or do i have to do
&gt; this manually?

As the LevelDB backup link above mentions, running this in a cron job
is a good approach. You're best bet is to use a tool like rsync for
the data directory backups â€“ although, if you're using a file system
with snapshot capabilities, that may be easier.
