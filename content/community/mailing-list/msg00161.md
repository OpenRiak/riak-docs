hi.

(i already posted this yesterday in irc, mailing-list subscribe was pending)

i'm using python to insert several items to riak. the code i'm using[1] 
receives an http 400 exactly while inserting the 238th link to an object.


the response tells no additional errors, also the erlang-log doesn't 
show anything.


something wrong on my side or bug?

can anyone reproduce this 400?

thanks in advance.

cheers,

alexander

[1] used code:

import riak

client = riak.RiakClient('127.0.0.1',
 8098,
 transport\\_class=riak.RiakHttpTransport)

print "client alive: ", client.is\\_alive()

bucket = client.bucket('t1')

a = bucket.new('a', (1, 2, 3))

for i in range(1000):
 x = bucket.new('x\\_%i' % i, i)
 x.store()
 print "stored", i + 1, "items"
 a.add\\_link(x, 'dings').store()
 print "stored", i + 1, "links"
