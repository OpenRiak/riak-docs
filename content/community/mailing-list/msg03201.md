&gt; I was reviewing the Riak Operations webinar, and it was mentioned that the

&gt; if your nodes were named "riak@ip.address" (approximately 40:05 in the video).
&gt; 
&gt; I was looking for some elaboration on this tip, namely:
&gt; What is meant by "rename data or do anything weird"
When you bring a cluster together using data copied from a different set of 
nodes you need to re-ip the first node you plan to start but you also have to 
change the ring manually on that node so when the subsequent nodes join 
everything works properly. 

&gt; Is "hostname" in riak@hostname a public DNS host that you configure in your 
&gt; DNS to map to the EC2 public hostname (ec2-50-18-...)?
You can use DNS (public or private) or host file entries that reference the 
private IP of the node if you choose to use hostname.

&gt; Does anyone have any best practices around vm.args -name in EC2 environments?
We haven't outlined any best practices ourselves, but I tend to believe using a 
hostname that you can change the IP for via DNS or a hosts file is a more 
flexible way of approaching the problem.
