I was thinking about these new asynchronous applications and Riak yesterday and 
it occurred to me that it wouldn't be terribly difficult to implement a STOMP 
adapter for Riak, right?

People use Redis as a message server because of the basic notifications it has. 
What if there could be a seamless integration between messaging applications 
and ones that use the REST API.

Consider the use case of a client listening for new documents using a STOMP 
client and a web app inserting those documents via REST or running M/R over 
them, etc...

It just seems like there might something worth pursuing here. Has this been 
cussed/discussed already?

Thanks!
