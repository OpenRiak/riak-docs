Hi

Any link for the "riak as a file-system via fuse libraries"?
It will be easy to wrap FTP or WebDAV on top of that

&gt; This sounds like a fun project. There are riak as a file-system
&gt; libraries, such as fuse, although I have no clue as to their sturdiness.
&gt; So, that could be a swap-out-and-done kind of thing for the FTP server.

&gt;&gt; Hi
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would like to find a OTP App which is a FTP or WebDAV server but store
&gt;&gt; file into riak instead of harddisk.
&gt;&gt; So that we can have a masterless local cloud storage for any kind of
&gt;&gt; files.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Do we have similar project?
