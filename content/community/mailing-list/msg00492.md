&gt; I love these recaps :-)
&gt; 
&gt; A humble request though: is it possible to add linebreaks (say at 80
&gt; chars) to the IRC logs before they go on gist? They are impossible to
&gt; read online and every time I have copy paste the text into my own
&gt; editor to read them! I can continue to do this, but surely others are
&gt; having the same trouble?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

&gt;&gt; For today's recap: another awesome slide preso, a great blog post for
&gt;&gt; all our Russian Riakers, info on a bux fix, and some great info from

&gt;&gt; Riak Recap for 6/1
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1) @johnylynch released a slide preso called "Rolling with Riak"
&gt;&gt; yesterday. It's only 23 slides, but it's worth every single one.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Check it out here ---&gt; 
&gt;&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/johnthethird/rolling-with-riak
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2) On the heels of @frank06's Node + Riak presentation, @kurokikaze
&gt;&gt; wrote up a lengthy piece that starts with a great overview of Riak and
&gt;&gt; then goes into some code examples using riak.js. It's well worth the
&gt;&gt; read. [NOTE: This one is in Russian, so unless you're fluent you'll
&gt;&gt; have to use the translate feature in the upper left which gets the job
&gt;&gt; done).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Post is here ---&gt; http://kuroikaze85.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/node-js-riak/
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 3) jharjono raised an issue in #riak relating to list keys hanging
&gt;&gt; when a Riak node is down. As promised, a fix for this was pushed to
&gt;&gt; tip yesterday.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Check out commits 1294 and 1296 for more details ----&gt;
&gt;&gt; http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/changesets
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 4) freshtonic, seancribbs, moonpolysoft, and justinsheehy had a
&gt;&gt; lengthy conversation in #riak about post commit hook, buckets, erlang,
&gt;&gt; and millions of objects.
