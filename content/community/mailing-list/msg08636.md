&gt; Hello Timo,

&gt; I recently played around with using secondary indexes instead of links, and
&gt; since I did not find any mapreduce functions that allowed me to follow 21
&gt; "links", I wrote a couple myself. These are available on my GitHub account
&gt; and I also submitted them to Basho Contrib yesterday for review.
&gt;

I just perused these for a few minutes. Extensive. Thanks for the PR.
We'll work on integrating them (and the other open PRs) as time
allows.

Thanks for the contribution.
