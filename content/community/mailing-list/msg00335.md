Check the ports in app.config and in the vm config in the etc riak/ 
etc. Check the tutorial in fast track riak. But I think the main thing 
that determines chit chat within a cluster is the channel name which 
is "riak", ie. r...@127.0.0.1, by default.

Hi all,

Trying to configure 2 clusters on the same machine. The 2nd node I 
fire up quits after a second or two. Is this possible, and I'm just 
missing some configuration? Or should I be spinning up VMs for 
additional clusters?


tia,
Sami
