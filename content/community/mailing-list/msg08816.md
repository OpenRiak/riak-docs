I am seeing an error when the search pre-commit hook runs on Linux (RHEL 6, RPM 
install)

{hook\\_crashed,
 {riak\\_search\\_kv\\_hook,precommit,error,
 {badmatch,...

On OS X 10.8 (running the downloaded tarball) the exact same process works 
fine, as it did with 1.2. 

Trying to determine if this is a problem with something in my application or if 
there is a bug with the RHEL build. Nothing was reported in any of the log 
files.

If anyone has any ideas, please let me know. Thanks...


Andrew
