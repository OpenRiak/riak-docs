Looks like you're trying to connect to the HTTP port using the Protobuff client.
2&gt; {ok, Pid}=riakc\\_pb\\_socket:start\\_link("127.0.0.1", 8098).
{ok,&lt;0.35.0&gt;}

The examples show:
1&gt; {ok, Pid} = riakc\\_pb\\_socket:start\\_link("127.0.0.1", 8087).
Port 8098 is the default port for HTTP.

Thanks!Jon Brisbin

I am running riak 0.14 and I know that it's working fine as I am able to 
connect to it through the http interface. I have erlang R13B04 installed. I 
tried this on Ubuntu 10.10 with erlang R13B03 installed and I had the same 
problem. 
Any suggestions? Is this is a erlang client issue?
Thanks in advance,
Qvin
