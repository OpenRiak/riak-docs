&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Could you let me know if the 1.0.0 release come with the possibility to set 
&gt; all bucket properties through the erlang PBC api? Especially commit hooks?

I am sorry to say that it does not. In fact only the same properties as before 
are settable with the PB API (n\\_val, allow\\_mult)

&gt; Thank you,
