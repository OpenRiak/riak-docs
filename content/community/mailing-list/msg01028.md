Hi Wil,

Thanks for the reference. That's just the kind of thing that I was looking
for.

Cheers
OJ

&gt; The plan was to create a Riak client connection for every request coming in
&gt; (maintained for the lifetime of the request). That connection would connect

&gt; round-robin). I was also thinking of building something into this mechanism
&gt; which would be able to manage an open list of potential target nodes to
&gt; connect to and handle when new nodes join the cluster or when nodes go
&gt; offline in an effort to make sure that the web application will "always"
&gt; know of a valid node to connect to.
&gt;
&gt; Does this seem like overkill? Would the effort in implementing such
&gt; behaviour be worth the reward?
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks for any insights.
