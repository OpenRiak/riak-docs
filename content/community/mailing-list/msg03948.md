Gregory Haskins.

about benchmarking the Java Client (complete with graphs!).

4) For any of our Riak users who reside in/around London: Community
member Russell Smith (@ukd1) will be representing Riak at the July
18th Cassandra meetup where they are planning to compare NoSQL DBs.

anyone is interested in starting a local Riak meetup:

6) We put the next Bay Area meetup on the calendar. This one will
feature the Formspring dev team talking about how they are using Riak
in production and what they learned running Riak at scale on AWS.

they contributed to the Riak Python Client.

Thanks!

8) This was already sent to the list in an email but warrants passing
along again: Basho CTO Justin Sheehy wrote a blog post about the work
we've been doing with Google's LevelDB and why we think it'll make an
excellent addition to Riak.
