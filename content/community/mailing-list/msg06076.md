&gt; Does the name in vm.args provided for a node in the cluster matter from one

It does matter, it is stored in the ring.

&gt; In other words, could I:
&gt; name the node 'x' in vm.args
&gt; start the service
&gt; stop the service
&gt; rename the node 'y' in vm.args
 4.5 run riak-admin reip x y
&gt; start the service again
&gt; 

Then you are OK.

&gt; I would like to dynamically assign the name prior to starting the service, 
&gt; but if it must remain the same for the life of the node then this will not 
&gt; work (obviously).
