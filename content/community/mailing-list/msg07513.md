Hey! 

I'm just about wrapping up the changes and new content for the upcoming update 
of the Riak Handbook. To make sure what I wrote makes (mostly) sense, I'm 
looking for one or two technical reviewers of the new content. The focus is 
more on whether everything makes sense, so not necessarily on grammar and 
spelling, or if there's something that needs further explaining and so forth. 
It's a bit more than 40 pages (compared to the PDF of the first version), and 
it'd have to be in the next couple of days, as I want to ship next week. If 
anyone's got some time to spare and wants to have a go at the new stuff, I'd 
very much appreciate it.

Thanks!

Cheers, Mathias
