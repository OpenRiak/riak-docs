Hi Bob,

That sounds like the connection got closed as the client was readying.

Have you checked through the server logs to verify that no processes died or
no other nodes went down? Or if it's reproducible you should be able to
start the server with 'riak console' and see what gets printed.

Cheers, Jon.

&gt; riakBucket = client.bucket('bucketname')

&gt; doc.store()
