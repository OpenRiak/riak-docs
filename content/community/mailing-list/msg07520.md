I'm seeing this pretty consistently and have no explanation for it. I
delete a large number of keys (20k to 100k), but when I then search on
the keys ($key/0/g) anywhere from 0-200 or so of the deleted keys show
up in the results. It doesn't matter how long I wait after completing
the deletion step, the keys stay in the list until I try to access the
object and then it goes away. I'm using 1.1.2 and the riak-java client,
and getting no errors on the deletion step.


We're \\*also\\* seeing this problem: residual keys that persist in 2I for 
days after deletion, and disappear on get. Using Java client, Riak 
1.1.1. If you figure this out I'd like to hear about it.
