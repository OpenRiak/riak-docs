&gt;&gt; The Python client has been pretty quiet in my experience (though I
&gt;&gt; only started messing with it about a month ago). I'm sure patches for
&gt;&gt; any/all of the above are welcome. I'm hoping the Basho guys have
&gt;&gt; someone on it to review pull requests and such sooner than later.
&gt;
&gt; Can do. I've already submitted a pull request to allow the client to
&gt; work with older versions of Python (e.g the Python 2.5 installed on my
&gt; Mac OS Leopard laptop).
&gt;

I just wanted to jump in here and reiterate that patches, issues, and
opinions about how the python code works/should work are all
encouraged. Mathias Meyer and Jared Morrow (among others) have been
handling issues, pull requests, releases, etc., for the the last few
months and should be able to do so moving forward. Between them, other
members of the Basho dev team, and a quickly-growing group of python
users, we should be able to handle pull requests, issues, and other
contributions at a pretty good clip.

In other words, keep it coming. :) Looking forward to watching the
code progress.
