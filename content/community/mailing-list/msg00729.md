Thanks to both speedy responses. The audience is most likely
new to NOSQL, and probably never heard of riak.

I want to talk about what Riak is and what makes Riak better
the others. I was trying to think of a good way to demo Riak.
But I'm not sure if it's feasible. I mean, I don't want to lug
3-5 macminis just for the demo. Even if they are very tiny. :)

Riak is a very good solution, but it doesn't have enough exposure.
I'm hoping to be able to do something to help with that.

The event is 1DevDay Detroit
