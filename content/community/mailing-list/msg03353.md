 Hi Christina,

 Just put 

 System.exit(0);

 as the last line. Some threads are still running and are not
 terminated unless you call the above exit() function.

 Subject: Help - Riak pbc java client

Hello,

 I am trying to use the pbc java client and I have written a small
 test client (that performs simple store/fetch/delete operations)
 using eclipse. When I try to run it, eclipse's console doesn't
 terminate (the operations are performed without any errors), is
 this expected behaviour? Any chance the connections are not
 closed? How can I debug that?

 Thank you in advance,
 Christina
