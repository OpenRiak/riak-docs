Andrew,

I think you're on the right track here, but I might add that you'll want to 
have upgrade paths available if you're using records -- that is, version them 
-- so that you can evolve their structure over time. That could be a little 
hairy unless done carefully.

That said, you could use BERT as the serialization format, making implementing 
JavaScript M/R functions a little easier, and interop with other languages.

&gt; I am using Riak using the Erlang Client API (PB) and I was storing my

&gt; Riak, but I got to thinking that maybe this isn't the greatest approach. I'm 
&gt; thinking that maybe it's better to store documents just as the record itself 
&gt; (Erlang binary) and then just converting the binary back to the record when I 
&gt; pull them from Riak. I was wondering what the pros/cons are to this 
&gt; approach. Here's my list so far:
&gt; 
&gt; Pros:
&gt; 
&gt; Native Erlang is stored, so less time to convert to the record
&gt; Better support for nested records
&gt; Smaller storage requirements and hence faster on the wire (?)
&gt; 
&gt; Cons:
&gt; 
&gt; Not readable through Rekon (or other utils) without modification
&gt; Can't use standard M/R functions which analyze the document (have to write 
&gt; all custom functions using Erlang)
&gt; Not portable across languages
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew
