Hello,

New to the community and mailing list here.

I was stuck for a while on Part 2 of the Riak Fast Track 
(http://wiki.basho.com/Building-a-Development-Environment.html).

It seems like the `make devrel` step can only be completed if installing from 
the GitHub source. I also tried Debian/Ubuntu packages and tarball, but those 
did not include the "devrel" Make target in their respective riak\\*/Makefiles.

Just thought I'd share that so someone could correct the documentation and help 
the next guy.

Riak looks like a solid piece of technology, excited to join in!
