Check your syntax. You forgot the index parameter.

search-cmd search [INDEX] QUERY : Perform a search.

$ ./bin/search-cmd search test "num\\_num:12"

&gt; I am quite confused because I am not able to actually make riak-search
&gt; work, event the simplest use case. So I may have missed something.
&gt; My steps:
&gt; $ tar xvzf riak\\_search-0.14.0-osx-i386.tar.gz
&gt; $ ./bin/riaksearch start
&gt; $ ./bin/search-cmd install test
&gt; $ curl -v -X PUT -d '{"num\\_num":"12"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
&gt; "http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/test/doc"
&gt; $ ./bin/search-cmd search "num\\_num:12"
&gt;
&gt; and no results.
&gt;
&gt; I have tried setting my specific schema, tried search-doc, the logs are
&gt; quite quiet.
&gt;
&gt; What did I missed ?
