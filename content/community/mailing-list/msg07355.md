Thanks for the response Daniil. If I understand correctly, you are
recommending putting all objects in the same bucket, and prefix the object
keys with device identifier + timestamp -- this enables querying across
devices for a timestamp range.

For example:

=&gt; find all objects for device foo between timestamp bar and baz

By putting everything in the same bucket and naming it as you suggest, it
also supports:

=&gt; find all objects for \\*any\\* device between timestamp bar and baz

...whereas with separate buckets (one per device), the same kind of query
would require multiple queries...one per each bucket.

I think this makes perfect sense. Just wondering if there is any side
effect of grouping all the data in the same bucket -- does it present any
kind of challenge for operational efficiency (e.g. backup / restore) -- or
does it make it easier?

Regards,
Davis

&gt; Currently we build similar system for storing different timeserialized data

&gt; {&lt;&lt;"devices\\_bucket"&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;"001122AABBCC-0001-timestampgoeshere"&gt;&gt;}. Then you
&gt; could make queries like "give me all events with all devices from time1 to
&gt; time2(in case if mac+id will be fixed size)", or "give me all events for
&gt; device with mac = 001122AABBCC-0001 from time1 to time2". Also we use new
&gt; riak pipes as a mr on steroids, pretty awesome.
