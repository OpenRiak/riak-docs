Riak Recap for March 18 - 20

1) Ryan Zezeski took a break from patching Luwak to write a fantastic
blog post about what he's doing with Riak at his day job.

\\* Read here ---&gt; http://www.progski.net/blog/2011/aol\\_meet\\_riak.html

Thanks, Ryan.

2) Version 0.3.2.0 of MailRank's Haskell Client made it into HackageDB.

\\* Latest package here ---&gt; http://hackage.haskell.org/package/riak-0.3.2.0
\\* Repo on Github ---&gt; https://github.com/mailrank/riak-haskell-client

3) Q --- What is the cleanest way to completely shut down a cluster?
(from deinspanjer via #riak)

 A ---Run "riak stop" on each individual node in the cluster.

4) We added a full wiki page all about Bitcask Configurations.

\\* Read up on your favorite merge settings here ---&gt;
http://wiki.basho.com/Bitcask-Configuration.html

5) Q --- I had a quick look around for a mapred ui. Does anyone know
if one exists? (from halorgium via #riak)

 A --- Daniel Einspanjer and his team at Mozilla open sourced this
one a while ago -&gt;
http://hg.mozilla.org/users/ibicking\\_mozilla.com/test-pilot-riak-frontend/
Daniel has also recorded a few screencasts to show how it works. This
is one of them -&gt;
http://www.screencast.com/users/DEinspanjer/folders/Jing/media/dfb73252-4dcc-4aa6-9540-bfc7150c51b7.
There is also a more recent screencast but I'm having trouble finding
it. Anyone have that link handy?

6) Last reminder about the Bay Area Riak Meetup tomorrow night (only
14 spots left).
