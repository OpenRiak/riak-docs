I think some other threads mentioned that the python client will be getting
some 1.0 feature love sooner rather than later.

&gt; Thanks Alex - I've been researching this today and looking at the
&gt; implications because it appears I have to change the storage backend in
&gt; order to enable it - additionally the python client library isn't up to date
&gt; with this feature so it means merging in dev code to get access to it - so
&gt; I'm not doing header manipulation inside my code alongside library calls.
&gt;
&gt; So now I have to consider whether additional benefit of doing this (and
&gt; other potential opportunities it creates) overweighs the changes needing to
&gt; be made to the system to get it working.
&gt;

&gt;&gt; ing features in Riak 1.0. In order to write out a link you need to write
&gt;&gt; out the key/value/link (in the header). Just include an indexing header for
&gt;&gt; what you want to index, link creation date in your case. Read up on
&gt;&gt; secondary indexes in Riak.
