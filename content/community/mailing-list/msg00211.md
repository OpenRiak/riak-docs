Hi everyone. Hope you're doing well. Tried this on the IRC channel, but I
guess it was dinner time. :)

I have a query which, up until today, has worked quite well. The data
currently coming out of the map phases are all correct looking, but the
minute I start a reduce, I get [] as the result.

Currently, for debug, my only reduce function looks like this:
function(values) {
 return values
}

If I remove all the reduce phases, I get, say, 2 items out of the query.
 But if I put that reduce function in, I get only [].

Is this something anyone has seen before? How should I go about debugging
it?

Thanks for any direction you can give.

Jimmy
