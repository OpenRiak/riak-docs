I have put a few objects in the database, and the object looks
like this:

{
 "userid" : "jane",
 "first\\_name" : "Jane",
 "last\\_name" : "Doe",
 "gender" : "F",
 "joined\\_date" : "Wed, 15 Dec 2010 09:15:20 GMT" 
}

I have 3 users whose id starts with the letter 'j':
jane, jenny, john.

When I use wildcard search, such as:

"userid:j\\*"

it returns an empty result. I did several tests, and it seems
that there must be at least 3 characters before the wildcard
in order to get any result. And

"userid:ja\\*"

also returns empty.

Is this normal? In Lucene, as long as the wildcard is not the
first character in the query statement, it should work.
