Hi all,

Thought some of you might be interested to know that the recently-released
version 1.10 of brackup [1][2] has added support for using riak as a backup 
datastore. This allows a pretty scalable and performant large-backup storage
cluster to be built using commodity hardware, instead of using expensive SAN 
storage alternatives.

Brackup is a modern net-based backup system that supports deduplication, 
intelligent chunking, and gpg-based-encryption, with support for storage on 
everything from local disk, remote ftp and sftp servers, to Amazon S3, 
RackSpace CloudFiles, and now riak.

Cheers,
Gavin
