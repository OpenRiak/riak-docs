Cool. Thanks for a quick reply.


Any estimates when faceting will be supported?

&gt; Hi Sebastjan,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! To run down the list:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - Faceting: Faceting is not supported at this time.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - Float Fields / Date Fields: Riak Search treats all fields as text 
&gt; (comparisons happen lexicographically), so you would need to encode and/or 
&gt; pad Date and Float fields. ie: Transform a float of 79.99 (for example) into 
&gt; "0000000079.99". Transform dates into "YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS" in GMT, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - Multi-Value Fields: Multi-valued fields are supported, but are merged 
&gt; together when outputting in Solr. This may or may not be what your 
&gt; application expects.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - Sorting: Unfortunately, there is currently an open issue that effectively 
&gt; breaks sorting: https://issues.basho.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=867. Depending on 
&gt; the size of your expected result sets, you may be able to get by sorting the 
&gt; results in your application rather than in Search.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - Fast Updates: Fast updates are absolutely supported! Riak Search was 
&gt; designed for real-time indexing from the ground up. (ie: No lag between 
&gt; indexing a document and being able to search on it.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - Stemming: Stemming/unstemming is not supported out of the box. You could, 
&gt; however, write a custom analyzer to do this or leverage an existing Lucene 
&gt; analyzer. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; Rusty

&gt; &gt; Hey, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Congrats on new release!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm considering porting our search engine to riak-search. We're currently 
&gt; &gt; using Solr and are quite happy with it except for indexing times where riak 
&gt; &gt; could probably be much faster.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Our requirements:
&gt; &gt; - faceting
&gt; &gt; - float fields
&gt; &gt; - multi-value fields
&gt; &gt; - date fields 
&gt; &gt; - sorting by floats and dates 
&gt; &gt; - fast updates
&gt; &gt; - dynamic fields 
&gt; &gt; - stemmed/unstemmed string fields (useful to get good data from faceting)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; AFAIK you support dynamic fields, faceting and date fields. What about 
&gt; &gt; other points?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt;
