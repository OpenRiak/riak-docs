You'll be constrained in the number of keys that you can store (using the 
bitcask backend). There's a good spreadsheet for capacity planning:

I don't know how well Riak would behave otherwise in an environment that tight. 
I'd think you'd be limited to single key lookups, but I have been wrong before.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; does somebody have some figures on Riak memory usage? I consider using
&gt; it in a highly memory constrained environment (&lt; 32 MiB), but I'm not
&gt; sure whether Riak can handle low workloads under such tight constrains
&gt; (it consumed &gt; 20 MiB idle). Performance is not relevant to me, I just
&gt; need partition tolerance, availability and persistence.
