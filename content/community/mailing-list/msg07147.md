Wes,

That information is in the '/rel' directory in the top-level riak repo 
(https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/master/rel) with most of it being in the 
reltool.config file. The magic of what gets included is sometimes explicitly 
from that reltool.config file, and some of it are dependencies that reltool 
(http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/reltool/users\\_guide.html) figures out on its 
own. Specifically in riak's case, reltool is called via `rebar generate` 
which does some additional work for reltool before it is called. 

If you want to see the real grit in how rebar calls reltool look here: 
https://github.com/basho/rebar/blob/master/src/rebar\\_reltool.erl

Good luck!
-Jared
