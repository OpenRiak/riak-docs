Hello Guys,

I am trying to find out how riak search supports fuzzy search with tilda (~) 
operator. I know doc says 
http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Querying.html#Fuzzy-Searches not supported, 
but few people were trying to convince me otherwise, so I decided to test it 
with fresh riak install:

curl -X PUT -H "content-type:application/json" http://localhost:8091/riak/demo2 
--data @-
{"props":{"precommit":[{"mod":"riak\\_search\\_kv\\_hook","fun":"precommit"}]}} 


curl -v -X POST -d '{"name":"Innocent Apple Juice (900ml)"}' -H 
"content-type:application/json" http://localhost:8091/riak/demo2 

http://localhost:8091/solr/demo2/select?q=name:Innocent works fine - as 
expected output of the record added above,
however even changing one letter and setting fuzzy threshold ( I presume 
related to Levenstein distance?) 
http://localhost:8091/solr/demo2/select?q=name:Innocenq~0.3 does not produce 
any output. 

So I presume it's not implemented yet, what are the plans to update fuzzy 
search in the future?

Regards,
Alex

PS. Given similarity in syntax of proximity searches and fuzzy searches will it 
confuse riak search?
