Hi,

We are performing index on a "heavy" write bucket, and it seems its consuming a 
lot of diskspace.

The logic is something like this:

"a", "b", "c" are the logical categories, we save combination of these 
categories

"a b", "a c", "b c", "a b c" and so we are looking at lot of data. But, 10G is 
quiet a huge number. So, we are little perplexed as to why this number is so 
huge. Is it due to vector clocks, since multiple writes could be happening at 
the same time.

Again help is needed on this one?

Thanks
Harshal
