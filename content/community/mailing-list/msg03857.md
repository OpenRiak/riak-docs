&gt; Hi,
&gt; A while back (in March) I asked for help/feedback in defining a new API for
&gt; the riak-java-client[1].  Last week I merged a branch to master of the basho
&gt; riak-java-client repo[2] with that new API.
&gt; Defining an API is hard. I like Joshua Bloch's advice:
&gt;     "You can't please everyone so aim to displease everyone equally."
&gt; Well, I didn't \\*aim\\* to displease anyone, but if you don't like fluent APIs
&gt; and builders, you're not going to like this ;)
&gt; I had two aims with this re-work
&gt; 1. A common API for the different transports (HTTP/PB)
&gt; 2. A set of strategies for dealing with fault tolerant, eventually
&gt; consistent databases at the client layer
&gt; The bulk of the inspiration for the latter aim came from this talk[3] by
&gt; Coda Hale and Ryan Kennedy of Yammer (and some follow up emails) as well as
&gt; from emails and advice on this list (from Kresten Krab and Jon Brisbin
&gt; (amongst others.)) The team at Basho have been brilliant and very patient
&gt; answering all my questions about the workings of Riak and the best way for
&gt; the client to behave in a given situation. And Mathias Meyer is the best
&gt; remote/IM rubber duck[4] in the world.
&gt; That said, the implementation (and mistakes) are mainly mine. Please have a
&gt; look at the new README, pull the code and play with it. There are some rough
&gt; edges, and I have a long TODO list of tidying and extra features, so if you
&gt; find a bug, need a feature or have any feedback at all please get in touch,
&gt; or even fork the project and send a pull request ;)
&gt; Cheers
&gt; Russell
