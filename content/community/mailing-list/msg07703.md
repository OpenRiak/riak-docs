Just realized I forgot to reply-all, response copied verbatim:

Jeremy,

An extrator is meant to take some data and extract it's constituent
field-value pairs. If a field cannot be determined for a given value
then the default field should be used. For example, when indexing
`text/plain` there is no explicit field, it's just a bunch of text, so
the `default\\_field` specified in the schema is used. By default the
`default\\_field` is `value`.

It's also worth noting that if a field is not specified in a query the
default field is assumed.

Does this answer your question?

&gt; Hello,

&gt; I'm creating a custom search extractor and am not entirely clear on
&gt; what is the purpose of the default field parameter. The docs[1] are
&gt; out of date and describe an extractor function with arity 2 rather
&gt; than 3. Can someone give me a quick description of the purpose and
&gt; usage for default field in an extractor function?
