I think if you disable legacy keylisting, we'll just break a limb now.

Seriously though, keylists are at least non-blocking in 1.0, so the
vnodes aren't prevented from doing any reads/writes while the keylist is
running. However, remember that a keylist of any kind that isn't on a
single vnode (the way riak does keylists internally is all per vnode)
requires a traversal of ALL the keyspace, even if your bucket only has
10 things in it.
