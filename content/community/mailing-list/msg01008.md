Hey,

I assume this works for linked associations? (Embedded ones automatically 
accept nested attributes). Looking forward to seeing :reject\\_if for both linked 
and embedded.

Thanks!

&gt; I am very excited about the new `one` and `many` relationships, and put

&gt; 
&gt; I want to use `fields\\_for` and the rails machinery for ANAF, as I feel is it 
&gt; a very critical and reusable tool for app development. 
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't implemented :reject\\_if or :allow\\_delete options, but plan to in the 
&gt; near future. I was hoping to get some eyes and critiques on this very early 
&gt; first pass.
