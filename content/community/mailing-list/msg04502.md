I'm having trouble simply posting a response to this list. This is my 3rd 
attempt so if anyone is being spammed, I'm sorry, but I'm just not seeing the 
replies and I keep getting rejection notices from the list managerâ€¦

Here we go again:

Hi Lukas,

Sorry it has taken me so long to join this party, I have been away and I'm just 
catching up.

&gt; It's not the prettiest code I've written before, but without the while-loop 
&gt; it will work for nearly 97% of my tuples. With the while-loop everything 
&gt; works fine.
&gt; 
&gt; ======================================
&gt; RiakObject riakIndex = new RiakObject(attrName, attrValue, 
&gt; indexString.getBytes());
&gt; riakIndex.setContentType("text/plain; charset=UTF-8");
&gt; try{
&gt; //have to be deleted because of cache (?)

No, there is no cache.

&gt; riakPBCClient.delete(attrName, attrValue);
&gt; riakPBCClient.store(riakIndex);
&gt; RiakObject[] fetched = riakPBCClient.fetch(attrName, attrValue);
&gt; //check whether the entry is correctly stored in the database
&gt; while(fetched.length == 0) {//try it until it works...
&gt; riakPBCClient.store(riakIndex);
&gt; fetched = riakPBCClient.fetch(attrName, attrValue);
&gt; }
&gt; 

I don't understand what you're doing here? If you want the object you stored, 
why not just returnBody=true for the store operation?

&gt; //fetched entry doesn't match our stored one
&gt; if(!riakIndex.getValue().equals(fetched[0].getValue())) {
&gt; System.err.println("index match: failed -&gt; " + attrName + "." + 
&gt; attrValue);
&gt; }

You really need to do this with n\\_val, r, w, dw all = 1 and allow\\_mult=false 
and no other clients? Something is wrong. Please let me know what version of 
the RJC you are using and what version of Riak on what erlang/OS/arch etc. I'd 
like to try this at home as storing data and retrieving is what we are all 
about and this should \\*just work\\* (we have integration tests like this and they 
\\*DO\\* work.) 

Forgive me if I am teaching you to suck eggs here, but right at the start 
there, when you store the "riakIndex" object, is there a chance it already 
exists? 
Does the bucket have allow\\_mult set to false? 
Do you fetch before your store (if you use the new RJC it does a fetch before a 
store to handle the vector clock for you)? 
Are you attempting to overwrite an existing value but providing a stale vclock? 
If you have allow\\_mult set to false and try and write your object with a stale 
vclock your write will be silently dropped. Likewise, if you provide \\*no\\* 
vclock but a clientId that already has a write on that key, your write will be 
dropped. I realise this can be confusing at first, but does it explain the 
behaviour you're seeing?

For fun, try this:

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k

(404)

curl -v -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k -d"a"

(204)

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k

(200) a

curl -v -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k -d"b"

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k

(200) b

BUT do the same thing with a clientId header set

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k -H"X-Riak-ClientId: pete"

(404)

curl -v -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k -d"a" -H"X-Riak-ClientId: pete"

(204)

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k -H"X-Riak-ClientId: pete"

(200) a

curl -v -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k -d"b" -H"X-Riak-ClientId: pete"

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k

(200) a (HUH?)

Does that explain any of what you see?

A well behaved client will always fetch before store, and will use the 
vlcock/clientId. The new RJC does this for you behind the scenes. See 
http://blog.basho.com/2011/07/14/The-All-New-Riak-Java-Client/ and 
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/blob/master/README.org for more 
details.

What is your use case? When you go into production will you have multiple 
nodes? Will you have allow\\_mult set to true? Let me know what I can do to help, 
'cos it is great to see someone else using the Java client and I want to make 
it easy for you to do so. 

It would be far simpler to start defining you strategy for resolving 
conflicting writes/sibling values than it would be to try and acheive 100% 
consistency in a distributed, fault tolerant database.

Cheers

Russell

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; thank you for your answers.
&gt; I know that Riak is designed for running on distributed servers.
&gt; But what's about adding lots of data and every tuple depends on another one?
&gt; I thought that having only 1 node and disabling replications could solve my 
&gt; problems of getting always the latest data from Riak.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there another way to achieve 100% consistency in a riak database after a 
&gt; very short time?
&gt;

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Yes, even for dev you'd be best advised to develop and test your application 
&gt;&gt; with the same or similar number of nodes and n, r, and w settings as you 
&gt;&gt; would in production. It's good practice to develop applications in a 
&gt;&gt; dev/test environment that mirrors the production environment as much as is 
&gt;&gt; reasonable/feasible. You can run a single node cluster, but note that this 
&gt;&gt; isn't a configuration you'll see in a production.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Lukas,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, we don't advise that you run single node clusters. Riak is designed 
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be used in clusters of at least 3 nodes. You can run a multi-node 
&gt;&gt;&gt; cluster on a single development machine by downloading the Riak source, and 
&gt;&gt;&gt; running "make devrel". Take a look at the Riak Fast Track 
&gt;&gt;&gt; (http://wiki.basho.com/The-Riak-Fast-Track.html) for more details.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm doing some simple tests with Riak and tried to build something like an 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; index.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore I created new buckets for some attributes like "name", "street" 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and "city".
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One entry in the index-bucket "name" is for example "Mueller" and the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; value contains all user ids, formatted as an JSON string: 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "{id:[1,5,8,13,2,7]}"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The java objects are saved as JSON strings in a separate bucket "users", 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the keys in this bucket are the user-ids, the values are the JSON strings.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I add 200 users via Java and the RiakPBC client every loop I fetch the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; index, add the new user id and store it again in Riak.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But java is too fast, so I receive an old version of the bucket.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because I've only one node I set the n-value to 1, r = 1, w = 1 and dw = 1.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I have to wait nearly 2 seconds to be mostly sure to get the correct 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; response. (the computer isn't an high-end machine ;-) )
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it possible to be sure that the data will be saved permanently and I 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can continue adding users?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there any caching methods I can configure?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can I set the default n-value to 1 so that every newly created bucket will 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have this value?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does Riak have any kind of indexes or is it possible to implement it a 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better way?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In my first version I saved all users in one bucket and iterated over all 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of them to find the correct one. But for every single request from the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Java Service to Riak it took nearly 200ms. For a huge amount of entries 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (10,000) this isn't practible. Therefore I tried to implement my own 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indexes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The main focus of my question is getting rid of the inconsistent reads.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.
