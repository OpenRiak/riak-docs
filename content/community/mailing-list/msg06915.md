I have another crazy idea :) What if I create a bucket for each blog's
comments? So, riak/blog\\_bucket/blog\\_01 and comments go to
riak/blog\\_01\\_comments?

Any ideas?

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I'm very new to NoSQL/KV database systems. Sean's webinar "Schema Design
&gt; for Riak" http://vimeo.com/17604126 gave me some idea about how to move
&gt; to kv database, but I feel I need some more advice/docs to fully grasp this
&gt; new concept for me.
&gt;
&gt; I was thinking about developing a blog application using Riak. Which
&gt; schema would be most effective for that kind of application (regular blog:
&gt; content + comments):
&gt;
&gt; bucket\\_blogs -&gt; blog content;
&gt; bucket\\_blogs\\_comments -&gt; comments for the blogs in the bucket\\_blogs
&gt;
&gt; or,
&gt;
&gt; bucket\\_blogs -&gt; JSON("blog": &lt;&gt;, "comments": &lt;&gt;)?
&gt;
&gt; The second option seems less effective if number of comments grow
&gt; significantly. But I'm not sure. Any hints? Ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
