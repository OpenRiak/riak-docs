I was reviewing the Riak Operations
webinar,
and it was mentioned that the preferred vm.args -name for EC2 environments
should be "riak@hostname" because you don't have to "rename data or do
anything weird" like you would if your nodes were named "riak@ip.address"
(approximately 40:05 in the video).

I was looking for some elaboration on this tip, namely:

 1. What is meant by "rename data or do anything weird"
 2. Is "hostname" in riak@hostname a public DNS host that you configure in
 your DNS to map to the EC2 public hostname (ec2-50-18-...)?
 3. Does anyone have any best practices around vm.args -name in EC2
 environments?

Thanks!
