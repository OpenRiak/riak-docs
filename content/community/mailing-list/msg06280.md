Hi all
I've been doing some work with Secondary Indexes and noticed this on
the web site:
"The $key index field is a special field that is implicitly indexed on
all objects when Secondary Indexes is enabled. The value of this field
is the object's key, so this field allows an application to perform
range queries across the keys in a bucket"
(http://wiki.basho.com/Secondary-Indexes.html)

However, I can't seem to find an example using it for queries anywhere
(Curl, RiakJS, Java client) or a way of seeing that it was indeed
created/used...

Any help would be appreciated

Cheers
Gal
