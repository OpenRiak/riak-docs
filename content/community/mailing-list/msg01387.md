My post is still forthcoming, btw...

5) Jeremiah Peschka wrote a post called "Foursquare and MongoDB: What
If." From the post: "Let’s play a “what if” game. What if Foursquare
wasn’t using MongoDB? What if they were using something else?"

6) jonas11235, seancribbs and bingledac had a great conversation in
#riak around MapReduce and caching.

7) notbehn and seancribbs had a quick chat about updating values in Riak.

8) Q --- What's a good way to mock out a Riak backend for unit
testing? I'm using the erlang http client.

 A --- Your best bet is to start with the ETS backend.

Info on how to configure the backends is here ---&gt;

9) chids and seancribbs had a brief exchange that started with "So
with Riak Search being in an "early stage" what's the risk of it
affecting Riak?
I.e. can I run Riak Search and expect it not to mess with the basic
K/V store in case of any problems/bugs?"

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/649894

10) nfo and seancribbs had a short chat in #riak about vector clock
behavior in Riak.

11) Scott M. Likens (a.k.a. 'Damm') updated the Riak cookbook for the
EngineYard Appcloud to support Riak Search.

Repo here ---&gt; github.com/damm/ey-riak

Thanks, Scott!
