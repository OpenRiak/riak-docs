Hi folks,

I was looking through Riak sources recently and came up with a naming question.
As far as I can see, all headers are named in a regular way:

 X-Riak-Vclock
 X-Riak-ClientId

On the other hand, prefixes are lowercase

 x-riak-meta-
 x-riak-index-

Is that the correct reason for such difference? Out of curiosity, what
is the background of this decision?

Thanks,
Vlad
