Hello,

Is there an rpm of Riak 1.2.1 available anywhere for CentOS 6.3 32 bit?

Whislt I am quite happy installing from sources (and have successfully 
installed Erlang that way) I can't do that with Riak as I haven't yet found a 
way to get Git working through our extremely restrictive firewall.

Thanks,
