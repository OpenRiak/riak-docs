Oh interesting :-)

In addition, I heard that Riak had also been made to run on Erjang; if that 
were the case you could in theory already run it on windows via the JVM. Really 
must find time to try this...

Cheers, Tim

&gt; Definitely share those binaries once you think they are ready for the
&gt; spotlight. There are numerous parties who are interested in building
&gt; Riak on Windows and, as Justin pointed out above, Basho's resources
&gt; are a bit constrained at the moment, so any help we (and the
