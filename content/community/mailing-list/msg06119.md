Perfect explanation. Thanks Andrew!
I'll stick to Lager from now and so on.

&gt; Lager actually borrows a bunch of code from riak\\_err to provide
&gt; riak\\_err's functionality (and actually fixes at least one issue that
&gt; riak\\_err had). They're not 100% compatible, it's true (you can't truncate
&gt; SASL logs AND have them printed to the console with lager), but you
&gt; don't need riak\\_err to simply guard against large SASL log messages.
&gt; 
&gt; Lager and riak\\_err both install error\\_logger handlers, and are probably
&gt; stepping on each other's toes when they do it, triggering that error.
