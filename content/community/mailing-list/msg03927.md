Hi Fyodor,

Following up, to help us troubleshoot, would you mind answering a few
questions about your environment:

 - What platform are you running?
 - What version of Riak Search are you using?
 - Did you install Riak Search from our pre-built binaries, or did you
 compile from source?
 - If you compiled from source, what version of Erlang are you running?
 - What interface are you using to index the files? (Solr or KV?)
 - Are you using the default schema? If not, can you send a copy of your
 schema file?
 - Can you send us a sampling of your data, anonymized if necessary.

Best,
Rusty

&gt; Fyodor,

&gt; I can't tell you exactly what caused this to happen but I can tell you how
&gt; to move past it. Search uses two data structures to store the index:
&gt; buffers and segments. A buffer is an in-memory structure backed by a file
&gt; on disk. Overtime buffers are converted to segments. All segments live on
&gt; disk but there is an in-memory offset table to perform lookups. During a
&gt; request if the vnode to handle that request is not already up it will be
&gt; started. During the vnode's initialization it will read all buffers and
&gt; segment tables into memory. In your case, each time the vnode is started it
&gt; crashes while trying to read the buffer file. Looking at the binary in your
&gt; trace it looks like somehow the data became corrupted. First off, I'm
&gt; confused by the syntax of the binary in your stack trace. I.e. what's up
&gt; with the brackets surrounding that binary data? That aside, I see two terms
&gt; in that data, i.e. there are two occurrences of the byte '131' which
&gt; indicates the start of a term. The second term is valid:
&gt;
&gt; [{{&lt;&lt;"logs"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"text"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"SEQ=1"&gt;&gt;},
&gt; &lt;&lt;"ae2b12ae-a155-11e0-9e33-00219bfc3293"&gt;&gt;,
&gt; -1309244813808575,
&gt; [{p,[14]}]}]
&gt;
&gt; However, the first term seems to have been truncated/corrupted somehow.
&gt; Why? I'm not sure. My immediate guess would be that a write failed at some
&gt; point, writing bad data to the buffer file, the vnode crashed, and then when
&gt; it started back up it couldn't read back the buffer file. The code to read
&gt; the buffer data expects correct data or it will simply crash, as you see.
&gt; This will cause a perpetual series of crashes until the problem is manually
&gt; resolved. In this case you can just move your buffer files, for the
&gt; crashing vnodes, one at a time until the problem goes away. This will cause
&gt; you to lose some of your indexed data. For example, in your case the
&gt; crashing vnode is for partition 
&gt; 433883298582611803841718934712646521460354973696.
&gt; You can cd to 
&gt; riak\\_search/data/merge\\_index/433883298582611803841718934712646521460354973696
&gt; and then mv your buffer.\\* files to something like corrupt-buffer.\\*.
&gt;
&gt; TL;DR - For one reason or another a buffer file became corrupted. As a
&gt; workaround you can move your buffer files out of the way.

&gt;&gt; Greetings,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've been running a single node riaksearch instance, while came
&gt;&gt; across this problem: after inserting roughly 200Mb of data every
&gt;&gt; consequential insert (into any bucket) would start to time out with a
&gt;&gt; sequence of errors logs that point on riak\\_search\\_vnode\\_master crash:

&gt;&gt; (the full paste of error dump log is here http://pastebin.com/0Bj5cJAQ)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Reads still work and I am slighly confused on the reason of the crash.
&gt;&gt; The availability of RAM is one of the things I suspect here:
&gt;&gt; "mem\\_total":1059192832,"mem\\_allocated":893632512,". There is no
&gt;&gt; shortage of the disk space or other resources on the system. I am
&gt;&gt; abit stuck as to where to start troubleshooting this issue. Any
&gt;&gt; pointers or hints would be appreciated greatly! :)
