I am using Riak as the persistence data store for a distributed data
grid so I really do not care to use Riak's or in my case eLevelDb's
cache. The problem I have is that when I load 10 million keys into
Riak it is taking 3.6g of memory. I have not set any of the eLevelDb
backend configuration parameters therefore I expect Riak to use the
defaults specified in the documentation. My bucket name is 7
characters and my keys are 7 characters. Any ideas on how to make
Riak/eLevelDb use as little memory as possible?
