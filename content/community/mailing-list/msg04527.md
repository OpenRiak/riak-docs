I can't speak for Jeremiah, but that's the joy that I'll be dealing with
once we recreate our "cluster" as a proper 3-node (using disparate servers).

&gt; &gt; In an off-list email (as Jonathan knows), I equated it to saying "You
&gt; should never do RDBMS development without a big enterprise grade server with
&gt; $500k of SAN behind it." I typically say to build a dev environment that is
&gt; as close to production as will give you production-like performance. Putting
&gt; 3 nodes on my crappy stock laptop HDD isn't going to give me anything
&gt; remotely like a production environment (wellâ€¦ there is always EC2
&gt; performance).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We see these questions a lot on the list and I don't feel that telling
&gt; clients "Well, it's gonna suck until you get it into production" isn't the
&gt; best possible answer. A lot of people seem to be developing on 3-node
&gt; clusters made out of Mac Minis, HP micro servers, and EC2; but even more
&gt; people seem to be developing on laptops and wondering why they're seeing
&gt; horrible performance.
&gt;
&gt; How do you test the inconsistent states you will see in production
&gt; when you develop with a one-node cluster? Or, for that matter on a
&gt; 3-node cluster on the same box where partitioning isn't going to
&gt; happen without some unusual intervention to emulate it?
