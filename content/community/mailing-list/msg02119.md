Sean thanks again for the feedback.

Using just a reduce function seems to cause Riak problems (unless it's me doing 
something wrong).

For example, I populated a bucket called "junk" with with the following command:

for s in `seq 00000 10000`; do curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' 
http://localhost:8091/riak/junk/$s -d 0; done

Now if I try and select some keys using key filters and a map function it works:

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8091/mapred 
-d...@kfm.json
["5","25","37","10", ... ,"18","22","17"]

where kfm.json is:

{
 "inputs": {
 "bucket": "junk",
 "key\\_filters": [ ["string\\_to\\_int"], ["less\\_than", 100] ]
 },
 "query": [
 {
 "map": {
 "language": "javascript",
 "source": "function(v, a) { return [v.key]; }"
 }
 }
 ]
}

But if I try the same thing with just a reduce phase like this:

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8091/mapred 
-d...@kfr.json -i

where kfr.json is:

{
 "inputs": {
 "bucket": "junk",
 "key\\_filters": [ ["string\\_to\\_int"], ["less\\_than", 100] ]
 },
 "query": [
 {
 "reduce": {
 "language": "javascript",
 "source": "function(v, a) { return v; }"
 }
 }
 ]
}

The curl command just hangs and I see this in the logs:

Use a reduce phase instead, which doesn't force loading of the objects. A 
simple identity reduce should do what you want: function(values,arg){ return 
values; }

Greetings All,

I have a use case for our app where I need to fetch a list of keys that match 
some pattern and was hoping to be able to use key filters for that.

In my test I defined a key filter for the input phase of mapred and then 
defined just a single map phase that returns the object key. But there is 
considerable overhead with that map phase because (I'm assuming this part) Riak 
is having to load each object to provide the necessary inputs to the map 
function.

Is there a way to do this without Riak having to actually load the objects?

Many thanks,
