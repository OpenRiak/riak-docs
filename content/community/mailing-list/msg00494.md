Awesome!

&gt; A humble request though: is it possible to add linebreaks (say at 80
&gt; chars) to the IRC logs before they go on gist? They are impossible to
&gt; read online and every time I have copy paste the text into my own
&gt; editor to read them! I can continue to do this, but surely others are
&gt; having the same trouble?

A humble request indeed. I think I can pull that off. Consider it done
and thanks for the suggestion. (Keep them coming.)
