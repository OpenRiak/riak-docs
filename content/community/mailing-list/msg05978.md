Hey Riak users,

You may have noticed on the Basho Blog yesterday that we made public our
tool called "Riaknostic" (http://riaknostic.basho.com/). It's a collection
of short diagnostics, wrapped up in an escript, that can detect some common
problems you might have with your Riak node or cluster and suggest ways to
fix them. It's all part of some of the usability improvements were baking
into the next release of Riak.

The reason I'm announcing this again on the mailing list is that we're
looking for contributions from the community. Contribute a diagnostic, find
and fix a bug, improve the documentation, and we'll send you some Basho
swag to call your very own! (including but not limited to t-shirts and
stickers) If you want to write a diagnostic but don't know what might be
useful, here's some ideas (all of which we plan to implement, so beat us to
them!):

\\* Make sure that Bitcask merging thresholds are less than or equal to the
triggers
\\* Check whether swap is enabled, recommend that it be turned off
\\* Compare configurations across the cluster, make sure various components
are configured the same way
\\* Check the number of open files owned by the Riak process and the
open-file-handles limit

Most of what you need to know is defined in the edocs:
http://riaknostic.basho.com/edoc/index.html. Make sure to read the top of
the "riaknostic\\_check" module documentation. Happy hacking!
