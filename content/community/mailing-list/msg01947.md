1) Seancribbs and matclayton had a very short exchange in #riak about
how Riak treats hardware.

2) Mathias Meyer (@roidrage) wrote an extensive piece on NoSQL for a
German Linux magazine. There are a few pages dedicated to Riak.

3) Looks like there has been some progress made with the Riak Module for Play.

\\* Latest is here ---&gt; http://www.playframework.org/modules/riak-head/home

\\* I also added a pointer to it in the Wiki ---&gt;

4) High Scalability published a blog post on Bitcask. (Better late
than never, I guess.)

5) Sean Cribbs, with the help of @frank06, @technoweenie and
@indexzero, put the finishing touches on an in-memory backend for
riak-js.

6) GÃ¶ran Krampe is about to get started on a Small Talk client for Riak.

7) Tim Anglade (@timanglade) published the first set of videos from
his NoSQL World Tour. Among those currently available is an extensive
interview with Basho Principal Architect Andy Gross (@argv0) about
anything and everything Dynamo.

(Also, Tim, if you're reading this, thanks for committing the time,
effort, talent, and patience it took to build NoSQLtapes.com. The site
(and its content) is fantastic.)
