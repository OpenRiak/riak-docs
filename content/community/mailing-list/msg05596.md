I've seen issues when leveldb runs out of file handles. The leveldb
log then fills with error messages.

&gt;&gt; This morning, while performing a query against one of the nodes, Riak
&gt;&gt; crashes. I then notice there is no disk space left. Upon investigating, I
&gt;&gt; see that all disk space is being consumed by the eleveldb backend. All 45GB
&gt;&gt; of of. Looking at the other two nodes I see that they are respectively at
&gt;&gt; 1% and 4% disk usage.
&gt;&gt; Anyone seen that before?
&gt;
&gt; I have not seen this error before; have you been able to reproduce?
&gt;
&gt; The logging is consistent with various bits-and-bobs of MR/Pipe
&gt; shutting down -- nothing serious that I can see. It could very well be
&gt; related to deletion, but I would be surprised to only see one node
&gt; having issues with it.
