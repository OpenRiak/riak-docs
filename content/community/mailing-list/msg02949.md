&gt; &gt; I found a bug in Riak, where do I file it?
&gt;
&gt; https://issues.basho.com
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The bug is that if you use the tokenize key filter and pass in an index
&gt; that is out of bounds, no error is spit back like Index Out of bounds error.
&gt; Instead it just hangs the server and a response is never delivered.
&gt;
&gt; I think it is already filed as a bug, can't find it at first glance but I'm
&gt; rushing to catch a plane so will check later.
&gt;
&gt; I have a fix for it here, though:
