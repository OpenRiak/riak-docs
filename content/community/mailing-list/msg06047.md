Congratulations. This is a very interesting idea and I think, a true 
need for the growing community around Riak.


May I suggest to give a whole chapter as sample? Giving a random 
selection of pages doesn't really give an idea on the "depth" of the 
book, neither about your writing style.

Hey everyone,

I'm happy to announce the public release of the Riak Handbook, the most 
definitive guide on Riak.

The most comprehensive book on all things Riak, Riak Search, Riak 2i, MapReduce 
and data modeling. I could go on and on about all the things it covers, but you 
should go and see for yourself: http://riakhandbook.com/

Cheers, Mathias
