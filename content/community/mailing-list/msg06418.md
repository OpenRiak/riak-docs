Sebastian,

Sorry I missed this part of your question.

The time required to rebalance a ring after adding or removing a node depends 
on a number of factors. These include but are not limited to: size of dataset, 
ring\\_creation\\_size, n\\_val, number of nodes, network throughput, I/O throughput, 
and load. Unfortunately, it's impossible to say with much accuracy how long a 
rebalance will take without accounting for these factors. If you want to get 
some idea how long it will take, you should perform a benchmark trying to mimic 
your hypothetical production environment as closely as possible.
