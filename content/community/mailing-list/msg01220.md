300,000 links is probably too large (at least for HTTP). At that scale, I 
would consider building tree-like structure where target objects are only 
linked off of the leaves of the tree.

&gt; Would it be possible to have an object with say 300,000 links?

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; i am experimenting with riak and have a problem with too many links in a riak 
&gt; object.
&gt; If i store the object the server send 400 Bad Request. This is caused from 
&gt; the link header which is too long.
&gt; As workaround i thought about storing the links inside the riak object and 
&gt; fetch them in a map reduce query.
&gt; Is it possible to do a link phase after a map phase in riak and if so has 
&gt; somebody an example for this?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks and regards
