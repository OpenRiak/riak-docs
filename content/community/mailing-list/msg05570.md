I'm running 6 nodes on EC2 with load balancing and instance storage. I'm
seeing an average of 115 ms per index.run() using a single \\_bin index,
protocol buffers, and python client. A regular get() is about 40 ms which
is acceptable for my application.

Has anyone done any tuning to get the 2i run() closer to the 40 ms of a key
get()?

Thanks!

Jim
