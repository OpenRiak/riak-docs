That was my post re: large ring\\_creation\\_size. I can imagine having more than 
50 nodes, as discussed in that thread. :)

But my question about riak's behavior after a node joins applies for any 
ring\\_creation\\_size...

&gt; I'm wagering that 2048 is too large. If you can't imagine having more than 50 
&gt; physical nodes your size should not be more than 512.
