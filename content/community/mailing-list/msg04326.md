As an additional data point, running 'make' on the source download
appears to assume it is running in a git repo:

fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
./rebar get-deps
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Is that likely to be causing issues?
