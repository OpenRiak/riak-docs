1) Make sure you install the search hook BEFORE storing the document.
Only documents stored after the index was installed will be indexed.

2) Try PUT from the command line to see if you have any errors.

You should get a 204 No Content.

3) Perhaps remove the quotes on the search term?
bin/search-cmd search document "attributes\\_value:WGN\\_WHITE"

&gt; I have a question for a first time riak search user. I installed riak
&gt; search the wiki, added a pre commit index hook, created a bucket and
&gt; inserted a key. The item in the bucket is a large json data set. It is
&gt; here at:
&gt; http://pastie.org/2049993
&gt; This is the bucket info:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; {"props":{"name":"document","n\\_val":3,"allow\\_mult":false,"last\\_write\\_wins":false,"precommit":[{"mod":"riak\\_search\\_kv\\_hook","fun":"precommit"}],"postcommit":[],"chash\\_keyfun":{"mod":"riak\\_core\\_util","fun":"chash\\_std\\_keyfun"},"linkfun":{"mod":"riak\\_kv\\_wm\\_link\\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\\_linkfun"},"old\\_vclock":86400,"young\\_vclock":20,"big\\_vclock":50,"small\\_vclock":10,"r":"quorum","w":"quorum","dw":"quorum","rw":"quorum"}}
&gt;
&gt; When I run a search command, bin/search-cmd search document
&gt; "attributes\\_value:\\"WGN\\_WHITE\\"" , I get zero results.
&gt;
&gt; What could be the problem? All help appreciated.
