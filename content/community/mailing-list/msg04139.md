Yes, it can be done via MapReduce as i was doing, but seeing the latest developments that speed improvement was null was a shock to me, moreover when i'm trying to build a social network... haha... I really think it will help if buckets could be queried ( MapReduce ) directly without minding how many buckets or data is inside Riak.Rohman

I second the motion!
BTW, as a side discussion, it may be possible to emulate that functionality with map/reduce, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as powerful/versatile as if the functionality were directly built into Riak... Not sure if emulation via map/reduce would even be worth the effort to consider.

Could it be possible to have "SuperColums" as Cassandra has? ( "SuperBuckets" would be more ideal name )I think it would be a great improvement if we can query a bucket without having to look at all buckets and keys in memory to search for it... this way it would be easier and faster to modulate data so if you distribute data in small buckets, the MapReduce on them would get faster... not sure if is possible to implement, but is something i really would love to have in Riak and it would help me a lot in my project... knowing that atomizing buckets ( "rohman\\_messages", "fyodor\\_messages" ) has no advantage over a huge "messages" bucket really disappointed me. thanksRohman
