Brian,

I just identified a potential issue. In my application code all keys are
byte[] arrays (or corresponding 64 bit integers), and in order to make sure
I can generate a valid Riak key String from that byte array I convert using
ISO-8859-1. However, when looking at PBClientAdapter.store() I see that it
calls ConversionUtil.convert(), which in turn calls
ConversionUtil.nullSafeToByteString() which uses UTF-8 encoding. Hence, my
original byte array will likely be different in Riak.

This could could lead to tricky problems like the application code logging
a byte array key that cannot be found in Riak. Do you think it would make
sense to allow the user to specify a custom String/byte[] converter?

Thanks,
Kaspar

&gt; Russell and I got together and discussed this a little more this morning.
&gt;
&gt; The reason it's not exposed at the IRiakClient and RawClient interfaces is
&gt; because the underlying original HTTP client API doesn't support a byte
&gt; array as a key; it only uses String. Because of this, our IRiakObject
&gt; default implementation only takes a String for a key, and our annotation
&gt; processing only works with a String as well. It was all designed around
&gt; being protocol neutral to sit on top of both of the old clients.
&gt;
&gt; That being said, what does work perfectly fine is creating a new String
&gt; from the byte array. Java does the right thing and this works regardless of
&gt; whether you are using the PB or HTTP client:
&gt;
&gt; IRiakClient client = RiakFactory.pbcClient(); // or .httpClient()
&gt; Bucket b = client.fetchBucket("this").execute();
&gt;
&gt; byte[] foo = { 0, 5, 120, 1 };
&gt; String key = new String(foo);
&gt;
&gt; b.store(key, "this is my value").execute();
&gt; IRiakObject o = b.fetch(key).execute();
&gt; System.out.println(o.getValueAsString());
&gt;
&gt; client.shutdown();
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The high-level API in the Java client library (IRiakClient) does not
&gt; allow one to use byte[] arrays as keys, only Strings, whereas the
&gt; underlying PBC and http APIs (e.g. com.basho.riak.pbc.RiakClient) do, via
&gt; the fetch(ByteString, ...) methods. Any reason for this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oversight or oversimplifying by me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Is it planned to add byte array keys to IRiakClient as well at some
&gt; point?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We should. Please will you raise an issue for it on the RJC github
&gt; repo[1] to ensure we get to it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers
