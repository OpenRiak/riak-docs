I was excited to see CouchDb on Android.

http://github.com/apage43/couch-android-launcher

Since this is running via Android Script Engine I assume this is
simply CouchDB running on erlang running on Android. Would this work
for Riak as well? Being able to replicate a store to a device fits
really well into an application I am working on.
