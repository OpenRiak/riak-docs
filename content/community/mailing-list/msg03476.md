Is it possible to configure Riak so that it is impossible to use the 
REST API to list all the keys in a bucket?


I would like to use a "capability security" approach where all the keys 
are unguessable random strings, such that possession of a key gives a 
client authorization to fetch the data for that key, and a client who 
does not have the key cannot fetch the data.


However, the ability to list all the keys in a bucket defeats that 
security model.
