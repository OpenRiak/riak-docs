Wow, this translation is awesomeâ€¦ I think the article makes some
great points. Bret Taylor from FriendFeed posted about using mysql as
a schema less store a while back:

There's also a MySQL plugin for accessing the innodb adapter directly,
bypassing SQL:

I tend to implement my services with swappable backends because they
run under different environments. The main site may require Riak for
a larger data set, but the service will ship to enterprise customers
(running with considerably fewer users) with a MySQL adapter. It also
lets other people on my team use the services without messing around
with Riak.
