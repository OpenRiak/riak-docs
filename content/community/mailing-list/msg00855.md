&gt; The error you get means that too many sockets are opened

&gt; 1. You are being spammed by someone

&gt; time and you start getting this message.

Well, file handles are for sockets and files, there might be a
backend/schema combination that likes lots of open files. Adding a
"ulimit -n SOME\\_BIG\\_NUMBER" in your start script would make sure you
have plenty of filenos to spare.
