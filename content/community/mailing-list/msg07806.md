&gt; Its not about the difference in throughput in the two approaches I took. 
&gt; Rather, the issue is that even 200 writes/sec is a bit on the lower side.
&gt; I could be doing something wrong with the configuration because people are 
&gt; reporting throughputs of 2-3k ops/sec
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone here could guide me in setting up a cluster which would give such 
&gt; kind of throughput.

To get the kind of throughput I use multiple threads / workers. Have you looked 
at basho\\_bench[1], it is a simple, reliable tool to benchmark Riak clusters?

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I setup a 3 machine riak SM cluster. Each machine used 4GB Ram and riak 
&gt;&gt; OpenSource SmartMachine Image.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Afterwards I tried loading data by following two methods
&gt;&gt; 1. Bash script
&gt;&gt; #!/bin/bash
&gt;&gt; echo $(date)
&gt;&gt; for (( c=1; c&lt;=1000; c++ ))
&gt;&gt; do
&gt;&gt; curl -s -d 'this is a test' -H "Content-Type: text/plain" 
&gt;&gt; http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test/keys
&gt;&gt; done
&gt;&gt; echo $(date)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2. Python Riak Client
&gt;&gt; c=riak.RiakClient("10.112.2.185") 
&gt;&gt; b=c.bucket("test")
&gt;&gt; for i in xrange(10000):o=b.new(str(i), str(i)).store()
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; For case 1, throughput was 25 writes/sec
&gt;&gt; For case 2, throughput was 200 writes/sec
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Maybe I am making a fundamental mistake somewhere. I tried the above two 
&gt;&gt; scripts on EC2 clusters too and still got the same performance.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Please, someone help
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The major difference between these two is the first is executing a binary, 
&gt; which has to basically create everything (connection, payload, etc) every 
&gt; time through the loop. The second does not - it creates the client once, 
&gt; then iterates over it keeping the same client and presumably the same 
&gt; connection as well. That makes a huge difference.
&gt; 
&gt; I would not use curl to do performance testing. What you probably want is 
&gt; something like your python script that will work on many threads/processes at 
&gt; once (or fire them up many times).
