Hi Simon,

Try using --data-binary instead of --data.

Cheers

&gt; I am new to Riak. I have been having a problem with storing some plain text

&gt; My test files consist of several lines of plain text. I store the content
&gt; in Riak using the HTTP interface, e.g.
&gt;
&gt; curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \\
&gt; http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test?returnbody=true --data @/tmp/data.txt
&gt;
&gt; The content I get back from Riak appears to have had all the line breaks
&gt; removed; I've also saved the output to a file from a GET request using the
&gt; key that was generated from the above curl command. Any idea why the newline
&gt; characters are removed? Is this behaviour correct or am I doing something
&gt; wrong? I was expecting to get back exactly what I put in.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Simon
