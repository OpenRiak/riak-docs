Riak links are unidirectional and non-reciprocal. If you did not
explixitly set a link on the child to the parent then it does not
exist. If you did set links on the children then a traversal/loop will
work but remember to include the body (value) in the rewrite. Write
links + body or you lose the body.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I have a link between Parent object and Child objects
&gt; e.g:
&gt;
&gt; Parent
&gt; -- Child1
&gt; -- Child2
&gt; -- Child3
&gt;
&gt; Now when I delete Parent, I want the links from Child to Parent to be
&gt; removed as well.
&gt;
&gt; I can traverse/loop through all the Children that Parent have and remove the
&gt; link one by one, but I was thinking if there is a more elegant way to do it
&gt; in Riak that I don't know.
&gt;
&gt; I am using the Ruby Riak/Ripple library.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your help.
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; Joshua.
