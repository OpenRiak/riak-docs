Hi,

I was trying out the wildcard search and i found out one interesting thing
that the wildcard search doesn't work when i specify only one character. Is
it a bug or is it some kind of protection mechanism to enforce faster
output.

Say if I do
riakc\\_pb\\_socket:search(Pid, DB, "f\\_name:Wi\\*"),
it gives me all the keys with f\\_name starting with Wi.

But if I do
riakc\\_pb\\_socket:search(Pid, DB, "f\\_name:W\\*"),
it gives me empty list.
