I ran it on one day (on a sunday) but each workload 4 or 5 times and
my hard drive had 150GB.
So it could be Amazons fault? :)

Cheers,
Maria

&gt; In my experience with EC2, I've run into I/O inconsistencies when I'm using 
&gt; anything less than 1TB drives and a large instance. There's a lot of 
&gt; potential for a noisy neighbor to steal I/O or CPU, or memory on the host OS 
&gt; which will put pressure on all other guests.

&gt;&gt; Hey,
&gt;&gt; I am doing some benchmarks with Riak and set up a cluster with 6
&gt;&gt; server using Amazon EC2. On each server I have GB of data. I am using
&gt;&gt; Bitcask as backend and Â the Java-API for my client. I have some
&gt;&gt; workloads with different proportion of operations, for example insert,
&gt;&gt; read and update. I started a workload with 95% read and 5% update and
&gt;&gt; achieved a throughput of 1207 operations/second. When I tried out
&gt;&gt; another workload with 100% read I only got 228 ops/sec. But I thought
&gt;&gt; Riak would be faster with reads than with updates. I would appreciate
&gt;&gt; if you could give me a hint, why Riak achieves a higher throughput
&gt;&gt; when doing updates and inserts mixed with reads.
&gt;&gt; Thank you in advance.
&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt; Maria
