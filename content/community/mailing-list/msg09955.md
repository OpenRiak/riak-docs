Scenario 1: If you know the object doesn't exist or you want to
overwrite it (because allow\\_multi is not enabled), you want to call
withoutFetch() - there's no reason to fetch something from Riak if
it's not there (not found) or you don't care what the value is
currently (and again, are not creating siblings)

Scenario 2: If you want to ... but since you're not fetching in the
first place the result should be exactly what is in your Mutation.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I have doubts about withoutFetch() and returnBody(boolean), I will put some
&gt; scenarios:
&gt;
&gt; Store object (or overwrite) existing Riak object where I'm 100% I don't need
&gt; to fetch from Riak (Last write wins and goes to memory cache)
&gt; Apply a mutation to an object but this time return the mutated instance from
&gt; the Riak operation without fetching it from Riak cluster (via apply()?) so
&gt; that the mutated result gets updated in memory cache.
&gt;
&gt; I want to use accurately both methods but I'm a bit lost with their use
&gt; case, so, is it safe to assume the following?
&gt;
&gt; Scenario 1: execute() without calling withoutFetch() and returnBody(false)
&gt; because both by default are false?
&gt; Scenario 2: execute() with returnBody(true) so I get the result of
&gt; Mutation.apply()?
&gt;
&gt; All described scenarios have no siblings enabled and use default converter
&gt; (Domain POJO annotated with Jackson)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for the response(s),
