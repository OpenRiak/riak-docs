I'm wondering if there's any way to achieve a limited secondary index
read in Riak, i.e., up to N records in some key range. With that
primitive, it seems like it would be possible for the user to
implement things like pagination, incremental joins over multiple
indices, etc. (For efficiency I guess it would have to be something
like "up to N records from each vnode"?)

Looking at the source code, I think the answer is no, but since range
queries are already implemented using iterators, it doesn't seem like
it would be too hard to add. Can anyone comment on the roadmap for a
feature like this, and/or the possibility of getting a patch accepted?

Mike
