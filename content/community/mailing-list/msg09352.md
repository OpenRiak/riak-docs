 \\* London office hours: 3rd December
 \\* Dublin Riak meet-up: 8th January

Our next London meet-up is happening on Tuesday the 27th of November
at The New Moon pub (maybe this should be the first of a string of
Twilight-themed venues we use) in the City of London:

There'll be a Riak raucous complimented by Basho beer.

Then on the 3rd December it's our first London office hours: come eat,
drink and ask the Basho London team your Riak questions:

And next year we're kicking off the first of many Dublin Riak
meet-ups, with utility metering company Temetra talking about their
use of Riak, hosted by the lovely peeps at Engine Yard:

London or Dublin, come join us for beers, conversation and swag!
