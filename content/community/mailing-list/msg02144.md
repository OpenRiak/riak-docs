I figured I would run into this when I thought about implementing a min and max 
key filter: in order for this to work, I need to know the values of the other 
keys.

So basically, I always end up with two in my result: the first one I come 
across, because I have nothing to compare it to and don't know if this key is 
the min/max, and the real min/max, which is the second entry.

I could work around this by using a reduce that only takes the last one in the 
set, but I'd still like to only return a single result from the filter. Not 
sure this is possible as it stands, however.

What are your thoughts?

Thanks!
