Jared,

Thanks! I'll take a look at that.

&gt; That information is in the '/rel' directory in the top-level riak repo
&gt; (https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/master/rel) with most of it being in the
&gt; reltool.config file.   The magic of what gets included is sometimes
&gt; explicitly from that reltool.config file, and some of it are dependencies
&gt; that reltool (http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/reltool/users\\_guide.html)
&gt; figures out on its own.   Specifically in riak's case, reltool is called via
&gt; `rebar generate` which does some additional work for reltool before it is
&gt; called.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to see the real grit in how rebar calls reltool look
&gt; here: https://github.com/basho/rebar/blob/master/src/rebar\\_reltool.erl
&gt;
&gt; Good luck!

&gt; When make rel is run, where is the information about how to decide
&gt; what to copy in to rel/riak/lib?
