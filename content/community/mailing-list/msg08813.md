Hi David

To me it looks like your riak service isn't started when you are joining nodes. 
What is the output of your commands?

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I booted up a two node cluster.
&gt; 
&gt; I got to riak control and I see that one node has 100% of the
&gt; partions. I see both nodes in riak control.
&gt; 
&gt; I am using 1.2.
&gt; 
&gt; How do I resolve?
&gt; 
&gt; Below is my code on how I join
&gt; 
&gt; cmd = 'riak-admin cluster join riak@%s' % existing\\_riak[0]
&gt; cmd = 'riak-admin cluster plan'
&gt; cmd = 'riak-admin cluster commit'
&gt; cmd = 'service riak start'
&gt; cmd = 'riak-admin status | grep ring\\_members'
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
