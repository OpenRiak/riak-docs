Hi All,

I'm working on an erlang client of the riak::search functionality built into 
riak-1.1.2. While I do see the support for querying data that is already 
indexed (rhc:search), I do not see how to index and/or remove data from the 
database. I do see this functionality in other clients, such as ruby or the 
raw HTTP/SOLR interface, so I know its technically possible on the backend Am 
I just missing something, or is the erlang client for riak::search not yet 
feature complete? If its not, I would be willing to submit some patches to 
help bring it up to speed, but I figured I would ask in case I am just looking 
in the wrong places.

Kind Regards,
-Greg
