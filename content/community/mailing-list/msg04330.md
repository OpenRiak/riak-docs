Unless you are running Riak as root the permissions on those directories
should be changed. The package installed version should create a riak user
and run Riak as the riak user.

&gt; Yes.

&gt; &gt; What are the permissions on the "/opt/riak" directories, specifically
&gt; &gt; "data"
&gt; &gt; and "log"?
&gt;
&gt; drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 2 Aug 10 06:27 log
