Thank you. It works after this:

./kerl install r15b01 ~/erlang/r15b01
. ~/erlang/r15b01/activate


When I run the tests in the master branch, I got:

 Failed: 24. Skipped: 0. Passed: 221.

I wanted to contribute, but how do I know that I have not broken something
if the tests normally fail ?

Cheers,
Andrey

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I have just tried to run the tests for riak\\_kv as described here:
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak
&gt;
&gt; Both 'make eunit' and 'rebar' fail:
&gt;
&gt; ~/projects/riak\\_kv$ make eunit
&gt; make: \\*\\*\\* No rule to make target `eunit'. Stop.
&gt; ~/projects/riak\\_kv$ ./rebar skip\\_deps=true eunit
&gt; /usr/bin/env: escript: No such file or directory
&gt;
&gt; What should I do to run the tests ? Should the documentation be updated to
&gt; add the dependencies?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Andrey
