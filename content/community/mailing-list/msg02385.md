I realized what I just said is confusing. I start out saying there is no N/W/R
in Luwak and end by saying essentially the opposite. Maybe I shouldn't reply on
my iPhone while drinking a beer on my front stoop? Such a nice night in 
Baltimore.

Luwak has no \\_direct\\_ notion of N/W/R. You can't call a Luwak specific URL or
Luwak Erlang API and pass it those properties. No. However, underneath the
surface, Luwak uses two Riak buckets to store all it's data. They are
'luwak\\_tld' and 'luwak\\_node'. Without getting into much detail, the first
stores the file metadata object (Top Level Document), and the later stores the
actual data chunks. That said, if you want all objects stored in Luwak to have
a N=4 then you should first set the bucket props accordingly on the two luwak
buckets.


What happens if there is a read of the object while it is in the process of 
being updated if the update is several different operations?
