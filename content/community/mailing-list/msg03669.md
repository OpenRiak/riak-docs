I noticed the riak-search prebuilt binaries for RedHat are all 64bits. Is
this merely a reflection of memory needs or of something more fundamental?
Mainly for development and QA, it would be bad if the unified riak couldn't
be downloaded and installed for 32bits.

&gt; Riak Users,

&gt; I'm happy to announce that Riak Search has now been integrated with Riak in
&gt; the master branch.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; To use Search you no longer checkout the riak\\_search repo. Instead, you
&gt; checkout riak, build a release as you usually would, and then enable the
&gt; Search functionality. It should be fairly obvious how to do this by looking
&gt; at `app.config` but there is a small README in the riak\\_search repo going
&gt; over this (which I should probably move into the Riak README).
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\\_search
&gt;
&gt; Along with the integration work we have also decided to drop support for
&gt; JVM based analyzers (i.e. the Qilr application was removed). While our
&gt; analyzers are not nearly as sophisticated as what is provided by Lucene we
&gt; engaged with the community and our customers and found that very few, if
&gt; any, are making use of this functionality. Considering the cruft and
&gt; general awkwardness this caused to the riak\\_search code base we figured it
&gt; was best to remove this support for now. Furthermore, this support was not
&gt; free in that there was overhead that had to be paid for talking with the
&gt; JVM instances running these analyzers. This doesn't mean we won't possibly
&gt; support more advanced analyzers in the future but for now we have what we
&gt; need for the majority of use cases.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, please bear with us while we update documentation and refine the
&gt; Search/Riak integration over the next couple of months.
&gt;
