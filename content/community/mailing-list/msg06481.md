&gt; security firewall rules on the EC2 dashboard.

AWS Management Console -&gt; EC2 -&gt; Network & Security -&gt; Security Groups

Select group -&gt; Inbound -&gt; Add port (e.g. 8098) -&gt; Add source -&gt; Add Rule
Note that the source can also be the name of a security group, so if all
your riak hosts have the "riak" security group you can use that instead
of an IP address.

Click "Apply Rule Changes" when you've done all of them.

In general, it's better to use the CLI tool chains (either the Amazon
one or the Boto one), but this will get things going.
