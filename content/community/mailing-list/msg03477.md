&gt; I would like to use a "capability security" approach where all the keys
&gt; are unguessable random strings, such that possession of a key gives a
&gt; client authorization to fetch the data for that key, and a client who
&gt; does not have the key cannot fetch the data.
&gt;
&gt; However, the ability to list all the keys in a bucket defeats that
&gt; security model.
