Hi ,

We have a huge database (around 4 billion record - 30 TB) storing the video 
watch infromation ie view count , comment , favorited etc. I want to produce 
daily report for all videos view counts. It means I need to look 2 day , today 
and yesterday so subtract yesterdey view count from today view count so I can 
find the daliy impression. Our Fat DB team doing this a few complex queries. I 
would like to ask you is this possible with Riak map-reduce way . I want to 
make a demonstration to the team to show this ..

This is the scenario. We have similar data models for other thins. This could 
be a start. 

We have 30xHP DL380 x32 Gig Ram Farm to test this scenario. 

Any riak map-reduce experienced member can show some idea on this.. I guess.

Regards

Prometheus
