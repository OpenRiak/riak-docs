Hey list,

is it a good idea to upgrade a small (3 node) cluster straight to 1.2 from 
0.14.2. Especially with riak's 1.2 capabilities negotiation, it feels like the 
upgrade process should be much simpler now? We don't do any M/R jobs currently 
and we are only using bitcask right now.


Best

Sebastian
