&gt; Sorry if this is the wrong place. Is there a specific email address I

&gt;

If you have any docs bugs that need filing, go ahead and add them here:

https://github.com/basho/basho\\_docs/issues

We usually get to them pretty quick. (Bonus points for submitting pull
requests.)

&gt; I am trying to convince our engineers to move from mongo to riak, and
&gt; running various doc snafus.

As far as convincing your team to move to Riak, what are the specific
doc (and general) snafus that are standing in your way right now?
We'll get them straightened out. :)
