Does anyone have a standard pattern for working with allow\\_mult with
the Python library? I feels a bit awkward to me. I assume I need to
do the following:

data = {"foo": "bar"}
obj = bucket.get("mykey")

if not obj.exists():
 obj = bucket.new("mykey", data=data)
else:
 if obj.has\\_siblings():
 # do conflict resolution
 else:
 obj.set\\_data(data)

obj.store()

Is the the way to do it? If so, that seems like a lot of boiler plating to me.

Eric.
