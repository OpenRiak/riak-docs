Riak Users,

I am pleased to announce the availability of Riak 1.1.0 RC (release candidate) 
1. We are providing RC packages of 1.1 to the community like we did with the 
last major release (Riak 1.0) in the hopes that you as a community can offer us 
feedback before final release. Unlike 1.0 though, we are planning the 1.1 
release to be a shorter cycle from first RC to final release (barring any major 
event or bug that is found with RC1 obviously). So, please download, install, 
abuse, and enjoy RC1 and let us know what you think.

Download from the downloads page http://basho.com/resources/downloads/ 
under 1.1 or CURRENT.

An extremely rough initial draft of the 1.1 release notes is available here: 
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.org
I assure you it will be filled out with actual descriptions of features added 
by the time 1.1 ships. 

As always, thanks from the entire Basho team!
