&gt; I know Bitcask has the expiry\\_secs option for expiring keys, but what about

&gt; files. This could be implemented as a storage quota also (high/low water 
&gt; mark).

There is no functionality like this in LevelDB at this time.

Also, I do not recommend using bitcask's expiry beneath Luwak unless you are 
prepared to deal with the fact that parts of a Luwak object might disappear 
before others.
