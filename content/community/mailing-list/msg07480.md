Just wondering if Riak is suitable to hub/satellite topography. The
requirement is to have specific shards of specific (per client) data
replicated between a satellite and it's hub, with 1 hub serving multiple
shards. There's also metadata that should be replicated to all satellites
and the hub. And I should be able to run queries between both sets of data.

It would also be advantageous to have actual hubs act as satellites to
super-hubs.

Many thanks for any suggestions,
K
