&gt; hey,
&gt;
&gt; i have a quick question about auto generating keys.
&gt; i know using curl post, all you have to do is specify the bucket, and riak
&gt; will generate the key for you.
&gt;
&gt; is it possible for the erlang library to generate the key for you? if not,
&gt; is there an easy to to generate unique keys using some built in function?
&gt; any leads will help, thanks.
