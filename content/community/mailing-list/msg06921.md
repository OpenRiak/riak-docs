The issue is that some nodes will be faster than others and then you'll be 
pissed off that you can't get your SSDs installed fast enough.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; we just had a client ask for SSD drives - we're wondering if there are issues 
&gt; mixing riak nodes for a while - 3 nodes w/regular drives, 1 w/SSD - the 1 
&gt; w/SSD will be significantly faster I have no doubt - has anyone had issues 
&gt; with doing this? I don't want to migrate all nodes at once for 
&gt; stability/uptime reasons... but i don't want to create a stability problem 
&gt; trying to avoid one : )
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
