Speed. I'm running 6 nodes on EC2 with load balancing and instance storage.
I'm seeing an average of 115 ms per index.run() using a single \\_bin index,
protocol buffers, and python client. A regular get() is about 40 ms. How
can I get faster access with 2i?

Subject: Secondary Indexes - Feedback?

Hello Riak Users,

The Basho team recently released Riak 1.0 which introduced a new
feature called Secondary Indexes. This feature allows you to tag Riak
objects with additional metadata, and then later query the indexed
metadata to retrieve the objects.

(See http://wiki.basho.com/Secondary-Indexes.html)

Now that you've had a few weeks to investigate and experiment with
Secondary Indexes, I'm hoping to hear about your experiences to help
us focus future development efforts most effectively:
\\* Have you tried Secondary Indexes?
\\* Does the feature help solve your problems? If not, why not? Any concerns?
\\* What is your wish list for the future of Secondary Indexes?
Please feel free to respond either publicly or privately to this
email, and thanks for your help!

Best,
Rusty
