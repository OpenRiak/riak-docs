Hi David,

OK, so there is no easy fix on Linux. I think generating the warning
message will help. Thanks for look into this.

I heard LevelDB has an API to force disk sync. Will Riak support this
option in the future?

Thanks,
Tatsuya

&gt;&gt; My colleague checked Bitcask implementation and found that it uses "fcntl 
&gt;&gt; (2)" system call to set O\\_SYNC flag to the file descriptor. Unfortunately, 
&gt;&gt; O\\_SYNC being set by this way will be ignored by kernel and has no effect. To 
&gt;&gt; make it work, Betcask should call "open" system call with O\\_SYNC option.
&gt;
&gt; Here's the rub -- we use the Erlang VM to open the file and it doesn't
&gt; understand the O\\_SYNC option (and arguably shouldn't). We'll have to
&gt; patch the VM in order to get it to do the right thing on Linux.
&gt;
&gt; In the interim, we will probably just generate a warning message when
&gt; using this option on Linux. Thanks for pointing it out!
