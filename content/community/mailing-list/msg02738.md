Maybe slightly a different topic, but it's always seemed a little strange to me 
that bucket names are prefixed to every key in the keydir -- or rather, they 
are part of the key at that layer. Wouldn't it be the common case that there 
are relatively few buckets? And so wouldn't it save a lot of memory to keep a 
reference to an interned bucket name string in each entry, instead of the whole 
bucket name?

This seems like it would only be more expensive (in terms of memory usage) if 
either a) your bucket names are very short, like fewer than 4 bytes, or b) your 
ratio of keys to buckets is near 1.

I'm sure I am missing something, though, and haven't poked into that part of 
the code yet.

&gt; Hi Anthony,
&gt; 
&gt; watching the memory that riak consumes is certainly the most important
&gt; metric. If riak runs out of memory you are screwed. On a dedicated node
&gt; just use the 'free' command to get that information:
&gt; 
&gt; total used free shared buffers cached
&gt; Mem: 66106100 49834164 16271936 0 232460 41492552
&gt; -/+ buffers/cache: 8109152 57996948
&gt; Swap: 1951856 36 1951820
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; the most important line is the second one. There should be "enough" free
&gt; memory. Also swap used should always be near zero. Whats enough is not
&gt; so clear cut. If latency is really important for you, it should be
&gt; enough free memory, so that your working set fits into that amount. Then
&gt; the disk is mostly used for writing.
&gt; 
&gt; The way you can eyeball if you have enough memory left for caching is
&gt; for example by using a tool like 'iostat' (in the systats package on
&gt; Debian). It shows you the disk utilization of your system. I usually
&gt; call it like that:
&gt; 
&gt; iostat -x 2
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course you should also watch CPU and network utilization, but usually
&gt; disk or memory becomes a problem first.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi Nico,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Its unclear riak-admin status eventually calls riak\\_kv\\_stat:get\\_stats
&gt; &gt; which states
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; %% mem\\_total
&gt; &gt; %% The first element of the tuple returned by
&gt; &gt; %% {@link memsup:get\\_memory\\_data/0}.
&gt; &gt; %%
&gt; &gt; %% mem\\_allocated
&gt; &gt; %% The second element of the tuple returned by
&gt; &gt; %% {@link memsup:get\\_memory\\_data/0}.
&gt; &gt; %%
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The man page for memsup states
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Returns the result of the latest memory check, where Total is
&gt; &gt; the total memory size and Allocated the allocated memory size,
&gt; &gt; in bytes.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; which doesn't tell me if that's filesystem cache or not. According to
&gt; &gt; top the riak beam.smp is using 3G of virtual and 2.7G of resident
&gt; &gt; on node1 which don't match any of the values from before. Attaching
&gt; &gt; to the riak node and running memory() I see
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; [{total,2392208240},
&gt; &gt; {processes,15012600},
&gt; &gt; {processes\\_used,12797856},
&gt; &gt; {system,2377195640},
&gt; &gt; {atom,824297},
&gt; &gt; {atom\\_used,812024},
&gt; &gt; {binary,898656},
&gt; &gt; {code,8336856},
&gt; &gt; {ets,556632}]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Which seems to reflect what top claims. I'm just curious what to look at
&gt; &gt; to determine when I need to add new nodes. I'm currently capturing the
&gt; &gt; statistics riak provides and putting them into rrds, and mean response time
&gt; &gt; is great (95,99, and 100 have spikes quite regularly which I still don't 
&gt; &gt; fully
&gt; &gt; understand the cause of, but mean/median is pretty good &lt;1ms). But I'm
&gt; &gt; wondering when to detect if the whole thing will come crashing down.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've used Cassandra for the last 20 months in production and had the same
&gt; &gt; issue, it works great then it falls over, and unfortunately with such evenly
&gt; &gt; space data, everything tends to fall over at once. I just don't want that
&gt; &gt; to happen with my riak cluster, so am wondering how to tell if you are close
&gt; &gt; to needing to grow.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyone have any ideas?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Anthony,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are you sure you are not including the filesystem cache in your
&gt; &gt; &gt; mem\\_allocated values? It will grow to use all of the free memory or
&gt; &gt; &gt; the total size of your bitcask data files, whichever is smaller.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; We have about 100Mio keys per node, and riak uses about 7GB of RAM.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So a question about when to add new nodes. I'm looking at the output of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this script and the output of riak-admin status to attempt to figure out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it's time to grow a cluster.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have 4 nodes 1024 partitions replication factor 3, currently with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single bitcask single bucket where both the key and the value are 36 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bytes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to the bitcask spreadsheet the overhead per key is 40 bytes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The current key counts/memory are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; key\\_counts mem\\_total mem\\_allocated (key\\_count\\*76)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; node1 22381785 25269010432 21015953408 1701015660
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; node2 22378092 25269010432 14076137472 1700734992
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; node3 22373770 25269010432 21565509632 1700406520
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; node4 22382394 25269010432 21493731328 1701061944
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; node2 failed at some point and was replaced with with a new node.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So there is some oddness here I don't understand. According to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calculated value I should see about 1.7GB per box used, instead I see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 21GB on most machines except for the one which was restarted which has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 14GB. From looking at memory it seems like I should be adding some nodes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; real soon or amount allocated will hit the total amount. Or maybe 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a memory leak which will reduce the amount of memory (as with node2)?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm just trying to figure out why I seem to almost be out of memory with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 23 million documents when the Bitcask capacity planning spreadsheet 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to suggest I should be able to have 282 million with 20 GiB of free Ram.
