I just did a riak-admin backup on a 0.14.2 dev cluster using the bitcask
backend,
then did a riak-admin restore on a 1.0.0 dev cluster using the eleveldb
backend.

No problem.

&gt; You can perform a rolling upgrade of each of the existing Riak nodes to
&gt; bring your 0.14.2 bitcask Riak up to a 1.0.0 bitcask Riak.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, there's no way to convert from one backend data store to
&gt; another apart from re-writing all of your keys into a new bucket with the
&gt; appropriate storage configuration and then deleting them from the original
&gt; bucket. You could also stand up another cluster on a different set of
&gt; machines and just read out of the 0.14.2 cluster into the 1.0.0 cluster.
&gt;
&gt; Hope that helps,

&gt; &gt; Can you give me an example of how the 0.14.2（bitcask） upgrade to
&gt; 1.0（levelDB）?
