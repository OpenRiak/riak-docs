Hi Alessandro,

I think it is a god idea. however my question is how do you plan to sort the
data? or is it not important for you?

&gt; hi guys,
&gt; i'm try to design a log storage based on riak.
&gt; the requiment are:
&gt; 1 the system needs to be able to store any number of these log event
&gt; 2 the system needs to be able to apply a label to some of these event
&gt; 3 the user can access the most recent log, and then can go back in time
(cannot
&gt; decide to start in the middle of the list or look for a specific event)
&gt; 4 the user can filter the log based on the label and access the filtered
list in
&gt; with the same parameter as point 3
&gt;
&gt; my idea is to store each event as a json document, the key of the document
will
&gt; be a uuid (type1). each document will be linked to the previous one, so i
can
&gt; follow the link to view the previus log.
&gt;
&gt; i want to add also other links that point to the previous event marked
with the
&gt; same label.
&gt;
&gt; i hope i explain enough the problem and the design.
&gt;
&gt; now my questions:
&gt; - do you think this is a good architecture?
&gt; - i read about luwak, do you think it can be used in a scenario like this?
&gt;
&gt; thank, i really hope to get some feedback from you!
&gt; Alex
