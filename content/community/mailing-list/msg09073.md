Tin,

The easiest way to report docs-related bugs and feature requests, is to
open an issue on the Github repo: https://github.com/basho/basho\\_docs

Thanks for bringing this up!

&gt; Sorry if this is the wrong place. Is there a specific email address I

&gt; I am trying to convince our engineers to move from mongo to riak, and
&gt; running various doc snafus.

&gt; Thanks.
