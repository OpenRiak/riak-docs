Lager actually borrows a bunch of code from riak\\_err to provide
riak\\_err's functionality (and actually fixes at least one issue that
riak\\_err had). They're not 100% compatible, it's true (you can't truncate
SASL logs AND have them printed to the console with lager), but you
don't need riak\\_err to simply guard against large SASL log messages.

Lager and riak\\_err both install error\\_logger handlers, and are probably
stepping on each other's toes when they do it, triggering that error.
