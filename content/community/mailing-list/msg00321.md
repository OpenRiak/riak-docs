&gt;&gt; I have a two nodes cluster and a bucket with n\\_val = 3.

&gt;&gt; I shut down the second node with "q()." in a "riak console".
&gt;&gt; Firstly, there was no synchronisation of data on the first node, i assume 
&gt;&gt; it's better because very similar to a node crash.
&gt;&gt; Secondly, when i did a read request on a document with :
&gt;&gt; - ?r=1 -&gt; success
&gt;&gt; - ?r=2 -&gt; success
&gt;&gt; - ?r=3 -&gt; fail
&gt;
&gt; This is due to the fact that 2 of the 3 vnodes were able to respond with your 
&gt; data, but not the third because your took down the node that had 1 of the 3 
&gt; partitions.

After the next round of gossip, will the remaining Riak node attempt
to reclaim these vnodes or does the ring structure persist until the
node has explicitly left?
