My bad. I didn't noticed, that backend of riak\\_kv has changed.

&gt; Hello!
&gt;
&gt; First of all thank you for that great DB (again)).
&gt; I pull recent changes from github and noticed, that data's insertion became
&gt; 2-times more slow and Riak Search fall on large range queries (on 350000
&gt; entries) those have been completed within 80 ms before.
&gt;
&gt;
