Hi all,

I want to use riak for several applications. Each applications shall have
its own database. How do we do this in riak? From what I understand one riak
instance is a database. CMIIW. Does that mean we need to run several riak
instances if we want each application to connect to its own database?

Kind regards,
Joshua.
