Yes. Add {compression, false} to the eleveldb section of your
app.config. However, generally we advise using compression because it
can increase throughput and decrease latency when accessing
highly-compressible values (think JSON, XML, anything with repeated
characters or substrings). The CPU cost of Snappy compression is
small.
