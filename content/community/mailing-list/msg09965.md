We also run on AWS and we use security groups. You can restrict inbound
traffic to other nodes with the same security group only.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; We recently published a blog post detailing methods of deployment on AWS
&gt; [0].
&gt;
&gt; More specifically, to secure the nodes behind an ELB you can assign
&gt; them security groups as they're defined here [1]. With regard to the
&gt; ELB, spinning one up in a VPC [2] is the only way to assign security
&gt; groups to it. This allows you to whitelist specific nodes trying to
&gt; talk to the Riak cluster [3].
