When I PUT data to Luwak more than once and subsequent requests have a
smaller size, it only changes the first chunk of bytes.

Maybe this gist explains it better:

(Needs riak-js tip. The assertion fails, and the received data on
getLarge is: "THIS ONLY OVERWRITES THE FIRST 40 BYTES lalala lala
lalala lalala lala lalala lalala lala uuuuuuhhhh" )

Thoughts?
