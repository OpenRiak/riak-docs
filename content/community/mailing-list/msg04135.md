&gt; Dimitry,
&gt; 
&gt; Could you be a little more specific about your problems. When you say "fall" 
&gt; do you mean complete failure or takes relatively a long time?

&gt;&gt; Hello!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; First of all thank you for that great DB (again)).
&gt;&gt; I pull recent changes from github and noticed, that data's insertion became 
&gt;&gt; 2-times more slow and Riak Search fall on large range queries (on 350000 
&gt;&gt; entries) those have been completed within 80 ms before.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
