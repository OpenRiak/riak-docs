Hi folks,

I've encountered an issue while using riak-js today and I was wondering if
someone on the list could help me with it.

The 'where' option does not seem to work for me. Below is some code that
shows the issue:
https://gist.github.com/947156


The second call to getAll here should not return any data since the database
has no memberships with 'mourinho' as the user\\_id but it does return data
anyway.

What am I doing wrong here?

I'll appreciate any help with this.

Thanks,
