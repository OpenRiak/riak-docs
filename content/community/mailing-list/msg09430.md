):
 app/controllers/profiles\\_controller.rb:28:in `find\\_identity'

We've run search-cmd install on the bucket. The code for the app essentially 
does the search-cmd operation at startup, too. 

There is one field in the model where index: true. This parameter was added 
recently so I can run find\\_by\\_index to lookup records by the field values, but 
my machine did not have any issues. 

Any ideas?
