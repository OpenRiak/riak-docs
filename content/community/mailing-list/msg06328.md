As the Jan. 4th Riak Recap briefly mentioned, we recently completed
research at UC Berkeley that's highly relevant to Riak and are interested
in feedback from the Riak community. In brief, eventually consistent
replication (which is often faster than strongly consistent replication)
provides no \\*guarantees\\* about the recency of data returned. However, we
can accurately provide \\*expectations\\* of data recency. Our work, which we
call Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS), helps make these
predictions. Using PBS, we can optimize the trade-off between latency and
consistency provided by partial quorums (R+W &lt;= N) by predicting both with
high accuracy.

Currently, in quorum-replicated data stores like Riak, there's no good way
to predict the benefit of using partial quorums or the consistency they
provide. By measuring the latency of messaging and using modeling
techniques we've developed, Riak can do better by describing the
probability of consistency according to both time and versions (see an
interactive demo in your browser at
http://cs.berkeley.edu/~pbailis/projects/pbs/#demo).

Thus far, in addition to general Dynamo-style replication analysis, we've
developed a patch for Cassandra that performs the required latency
profiling and are interested in potentially working to integrate PBS
analysis into additional data stores like Riak, which can also benefit from
PBS analysis (see code and documentation at
https://github.com/pbailis/cassandra-pbs). These techniques are broadly
applicable: for example, in our Technical Report (
http://cs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-4.pdf), in addition to
examining Cassandra and Voldemort, thanks to Coda Hale, we predicted the
latency-consistency trade-offs of a production Riak deployment at Yammer
(thanks again to Coda Hale!). The sample analysis script we've written for
Cassandra will work for Riak as well given the proper input format.

We'd welcome any feedback or questions you might have.

Thanks!
