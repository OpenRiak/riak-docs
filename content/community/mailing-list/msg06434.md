Did you forget to paste in what you are still seeing? Is it the tainted
ring message?


&gt;
&gt; I would still be interested in your question about knowing if there is a
&gt; better way to recover from this?
&gt;

Currently this is the recommended way to recover from a corrupted Search
index. That is, move the corrupted index dir to let Riak progress forward.


&gt;
&gt; Also since I'm sure my search indices are now in bad shape, if there is a
&gt; way to rebuild all the indices besides using the python driver to
&gt; read/write
&gt; each key again? Possibly the 'search-cmd' or maybe something from the
&gt; erlang console?
&gt;

Unfortunately, no. The recommended way is to re-index all your keys to
verify that you recreated the destroyed indexes.
