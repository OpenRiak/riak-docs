Earlier this month, we announced the availability of Riak CS 1.4, which added a number of performance improvements, OpenStack integration, and simpler user management. To provide more details about what was introduced with the latest release, we also hosted a “What’s New in Riak CS 1.4” webcast.
This short webcast provides an overview of both Riak CS and Riak, and discusses what’s new in Riak CS 1.4. It also looks at the fundamental features and architecture of Riak CS, talks about the key partnerships, and discusses Riak CS Enterprise – the commercial extension of Riak CS.
You can watch the complete recording below.
