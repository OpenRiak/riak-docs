Today we’re excited to introduce early access of Riak on Engine Yard! You can also learn more on the Engine Yard blog. With Riak on Engine Yard, you can deploy a Riak cluster as simply as defining some configuration values and clicking “Add Cluster.”
A common theme, in several of our recent blog posts, has been Riak’s key focus on ease of deployment. We excel in making highly available, low latency, distributed systems. Engine Yard’s strengths lie in providing a hardened and secure Platform as a Service where you can manage your entire platform while retaining control of the environment. In addition, Engine Yard is well known for its contributions to the Ruby, PHP, and Node.js communities. The introduction of Riak on Engine Yard further validates customer demand for reliable and easy to use cloud solutions.
If you were at Ricon2012, you were probably one of the many who attended a talk entitled “Riak in the Cloud.” If you were unable to attend, you missed an amazing session where Ines Sombra and Michael Broadhead from Engine Yard spoke about their experiences with Riak and deploying it in the cloud. It’s great to see the lessons of distributed systems that were discussed translated into reality.
We look forward to seeing what the Riak community builds using Riak on Engine Yard. Get started now with 500 hours for free on their platform.
