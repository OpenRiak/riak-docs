Those of you who are familiar with the Riak Wiki may have been surprised by what you saw at wiki.riak.com starting yesterday. That’s because we just gave it a facelift. More importantly, the team at Riak has spent a fair amount of time converting the Riak Wiki to use Gollum. Gollum is a “simple, Git-powered wiki with a sweet API and local frontend” written and maintained by the awesome team at GitHub.
Those of you who are accustomed to the “old wiki” will find the same great content with a revamped design, something that more closely resembles the look and feel of riak.com and the Riak Function Contrib.
Arguably the best feature of using Gollum is that contributing to the Riak Wiki is now dead simple, and is no different than contributing code to any repo on GitHub. Riak users are, after all, developers. Why not let them work with a wiki the same way they work with Riak code itself?
This is one of several website enhancements you’ll be seeing from the team at Riak over the coming months, so stay tuned.
In the meantime, peruse the new wiki and of course, go download Riak if you haven’t already.
