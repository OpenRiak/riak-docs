Riak CS (Cloud Storage) is simple, open source storage software built on top of Riak. s3cmd is a command-line tool for uploading, retrieving, and managing data via an Amazon S3 compatible API.
In this short screencast, we cover the process of installing and configuring s3cmd on a Debian- or Ubuntu-based system. Once installed, we’ll use Amazon’s s3cmd tool to manage buckets and files in Riak CS. You can view the entire screencast below.
Due to the small type used in the screencast, we recommend viewing this video at a high resolution.
