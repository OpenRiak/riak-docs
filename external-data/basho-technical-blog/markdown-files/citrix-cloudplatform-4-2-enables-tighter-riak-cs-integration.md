Riak would like to congratulate Citrix on their launch of CloudPlatform 4.2
This release introduces the first integration of S3-compatible object storage into the CloudPlatform infrastructure, which provides the foundation necessary to enable a tighter integration between CloudPlatform and Riak CS. Cloud-era workloads that require object storage can easily run on CloudPlatform and have transparent access to storage across geographic and logically defined locations.
For mutual customers of Riak and Citrix, this integration can be leveraged to provide either for secondary storage for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) components or as a method of providing Storage-as-a-service (StaaS) to their customers.
Riak remains committed to offering a holistic integration for CloudPlatform users who require the scalability, availability, and ease of operation offered by Riak CS.
