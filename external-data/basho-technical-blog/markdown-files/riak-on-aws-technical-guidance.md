Today, we are excited to share a recent whitepaper released by the Amazon team entitled, “NoSQL Database in the Cloud: Riak on AWS.” This paper provides technical guidance on running Riak on the Amazon platform, including an overview of:

Basic Installation
Riak Architecture and Scale
Operational Considerations (including sizing and configuration)
AWS specific security configuration
A discussion of Replication (as enabled by Riak Enterprise)

Given the number of Riak users (both open source and enterprise) who leverage public cloud environments, either as a part of their infrastructure or as the foundation of it, Riak will continue to invest in partnerships that provide deployment choice and deployment ease. Whether it’s for a hybrid cloud model – used to address burst capacity, tenancy/data locality, and proof of concept needs – or for an investment solely in public cloud, Riak will provide the operational simplicity and scalability required for your critical data.
For more information about deploying Riak on AWS, check out our posts about the Riak AMI and our other deployment options, including automated scripts and manual installation. You can also find more information about what to consider when installing Riak on AWS in our documentation.
