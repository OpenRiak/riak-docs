RICON, being held next week in San Francisco, features a list of distinguished experts on the front lines of the evolving world of big data, storage and distributed systems including  Jose Faleiro, a computer science PhD candidate at Yale University. His research is focussed on building performant and robust large-scale concurrent systems.
Jose’s latest blog can be found here and explores how it is very much possible for a scalable system to support performant distributed atomic transactions.
Jose is presentation “Demystifying Distributed Transactions with the Fairness -Isolation-Throughput Tradeoff” is scheduled for 3:00-3:50 PM on November 5th.
More information on his research can be found on his home-page.
