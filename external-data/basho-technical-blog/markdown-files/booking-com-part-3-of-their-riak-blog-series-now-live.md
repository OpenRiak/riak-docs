Booking.com manages billions of events every day. However, these events are schema-less and therefore a difficult task for standard analytics tools to handle. That’s why Booking.com has implemented a solution built on Riak KV. They’ve built an Events Storage Database to address near-real-time analysis of the data flow. It’s allowed Booking.com to push the boundaries of innovation and keep monitoring and analysing the whole platform while managing hundreds of thousands of properties.
This post, cowritten by Damien Krotkine and Ivan Paponov, shares how Booking.com uses Riak to constantly monitor, inspect and analyze its platform. Part three of a four part series is now live and describing exactly how and why Riak gets used at Booking.com.
