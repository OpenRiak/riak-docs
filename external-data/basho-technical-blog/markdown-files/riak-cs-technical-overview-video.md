In this video, Riak Chief Architect Andy Gross provides a technical overview of Riak CS, which we open sourced last week. This video was filmed at the CloudStack Collaboration Conference last November. It looks at Riak CS architecture, operations, interfaces and use cases, as well as our partnership with CloudStack. Slides and video are below, and make sure to check out new features weâ€™ve added in the last release.
