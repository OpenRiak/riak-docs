If you’re interested in learning more about distributed systems, check out Think Distributed, a new podcast by Riak Software Engineer, Chris Meiklejohn. This podcast aims to deal with all aspects of distributed systems and will bring in panelists from many different areas.
The first episode is now available and discusses the problem of consensus in distributed computing – with a focus on the Raft algorithm developed by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout at Stanford University.
This episode’s panelists are:

Chris Meiklejohn, Software Engineer at Riak Technologies
Justin Sheehy, CTO at Riak Technologies
Peter Bailis, Graduate Student at UC Berkeley
Diego Ongaro, Graduate Student at Stanford University
Andrew Stone, Software Engineer at Riak Technologies

If you’re interested in hearing more on consensus and the Raft algorithm, Diego Ongaro will also be speaking at RICON West, Riak’s distributed systems conference.
