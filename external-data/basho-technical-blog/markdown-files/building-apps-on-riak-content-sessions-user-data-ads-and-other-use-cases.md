How do I build my application on Riak? This is one of the first questions we get from people new to Riak. Whether you are new to the key/value model, switching from a relational database, or building a new application on Riak, we’ve got a new section of the docs to help you get started.
Learn about data models for common application types – including high read/write use cases (session storage, ad platforms, log and sensor data) and apps that require relationship modeling (content-serving applications and user accounts, settings, and events). While not meant to be a prescriptive guide, this section walks through common simple and complex approaches to building apps using Riak’s key/value design and features such as MapReduce, search and secondary indexing. You can also check out the stories of users like Voxer, Clipboard and Yammer to learn more about how they built their apps on Riak.
This is just the start of a bigger effort to help users better understand how to build amazing applications on Riak. We will be adding code examples, other application types, additional considerations, and more stories from the user community. We’d love to add your contributions, so please submit a pull request or file an issue on our Github repo if you have anything to add or anything you’d like to know more about.
