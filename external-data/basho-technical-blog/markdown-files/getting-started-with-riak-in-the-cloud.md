Earlier this year, we announced that hosted Riak is now available on the Engine Yard platform. Ines Sombra, Lead Data Engineer at Engine Yard, has put together a talk to help you get started using Riak in cloud environments. This talk introduces Riakâ€™s overall architecture, some common use cases, and goes over some questions to consider when choosing a database. It also discusses what you need to know to run Riak in the cloud and how it differs from traditional hardware installation.
You can view the full talk below:
