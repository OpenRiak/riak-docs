December 30, 2014
At Riak, we are proud of our documentation. All design, updates, and edits are done with our community top of mind and we encourage community participation. Given the pace at which our documentarian expert, Luc Perkins, is updating the content, it can be easy to fall behind in reading new and updated materials. So we have a holiday gift to help you out.
Below is our Top 10 suggested New Year’s reading list.
#10 – A Migrating from an SQL Database to Riak tutorial can help prepare you as embrace a new style of development and persistence.
#9 – The new Object Updates doc that explains the read/modify/write cycle, plus polyglot code samples, including a special section devoted to object updates using the Java client.
#8 – Our documentation on Conflict Resolution has been pretty heavily revamped. Client-library-specific pages have been added for Java, Ruby, and Python (Erlang on the way soon).
#7 – Strong consistency has gone from having light documentation to being one of our best-documented open-source features. Strong Consistency docs are spread across the following:

Using Strong Consistency (dev)
Managing Strong Consistency (ops)
Strong Consistency (theory)

#6 – We now have client-side security docs! There’s an introductory doc that walks you a bit through how client security works in Riak as well as client-specific docs for Java, Ruby, Python, and Erlang.
#5 – A new Erlang VM Tuning doc. This is still a work in progress. As we said at the beginning, we really encourage community involvement. What tuning have you done to optimize your Erlang environment?
In addition to the above, there is new documentation on the topics below.
#4 – Vnodes, Logging, Stanchion
#3 – Custom Search Extractors
#2 – Riak Data Types and Search
Drum roll please….
#1 – Riak 2.0 – if you missed this you missed a lot.
We want to thank everyone in the community who participates in making the Riak documentation the most useful set of materials possible. Remember: to submit issues is human, to submit PRs is divine.
Happy New Year!
Riak Team
