Riak Cloud Storage is simple, available cloud storage software built on top of Riak. It offers an S3 API, multi-tenancy and large object support for enterprises building public or private clouds. We want to make it easier to get started with Riak CS, so we’re now offering a self-service test harness. Visit riakcs.net to sign up – you can explore the functionality, test API operations, and experiment with clients and development apps. With the self-service feature, you can start playing right away.
Note that the test harness is primarily for exploring Riak CS features – if you want to do load testing and performance benchmarking, you should sign up for a developer trial that will give you access to Riak CS packages you can install and test on your own hardware.
Interested in learning more about Riak CS? All of the docs are available online.
