February 1st, 2015
If you missed last week’s webinar Preparing for the Deluge of Unstructured Data you can still watch it on-demand. Dorothy Pults and I discuss the news emanating from the 2015 Consumer Electronics show and highlight that the Internet of Thing, connected devices, and the resulting explosion of unstructured data are front and center of growth trends in 2015. In particular, we covered the topics of:

What is driving the growth in unstructured data
The challenges associated with managing unstructured data
How companies are capitalizing on the opportunities that unstructured data presents, to save money, time, and create new market opportunities

The webinar covers each of these topic in great details and provides some insights on distributed systems.
Why Distributed Systems?
Companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google have built huge distributed systems with strict requirements around scalability, fault tolerance, and global footprints. These same concepts must now be considered by companies of all sizes…from the Enterprise to the startup.
The reality is that everything works at small scale. Challenges arise as it becomes necessary to scale out, up and down, predictably and linearly. When assuming that failure and latency are part of the equation, it is necessary to choose a distributed database that enables horizontal scale. And, similarly, that it enables this scale on commodity hardware or the compute instance that your business has adopted in its architecture. This is particularly important when data governance is a key component of your design considerations.
Ultimately, the customer experience matters. When designing your distributed architecture, and choosing persistence solutions like Riak, ensure that there is a solution for the geographic distribution of data (like Riak Enterprise’s multi-datacenter replication capability) to provide low latency experiences for your customers, regardless of their physical location.
