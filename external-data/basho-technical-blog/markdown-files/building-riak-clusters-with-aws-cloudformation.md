Today we’re introducing an easier way to build Riak clusters on AWS using CloudFormation.
The project, cloudformation-riak, comes with three CloudFormation templates. These templates range from building a simple Riak cluster to building a VPC-based stack that includes: a front-end load balancer; a cluster of application servers with a Riak powered demo application; a backend load balancer; and a riak-cluster.
Head over to the cloudformation-riak repo to get started. We also put together a screencast (below) that shows things in action.
Enjoy.
James
