Last week, we announced that Riak CS is now open source. To complement this announcement, here’s a 15-minute overview of Riak CS and how it can be used.
Below is a video that goes over the basics of Riak CS, taken from the Citrix CloudPlatform partner program. You will learn the key building blocks of cloud services platforms and the enterprise requirements for cloud storage. You will also learn the properties, architecture, interfaces, and operations of Riak CS.

To learn more about Riak CS, visit the site or sign up for our webcast on April 2. If you’re interested in Riak CS Enterprise, you can also request a developer trial.
