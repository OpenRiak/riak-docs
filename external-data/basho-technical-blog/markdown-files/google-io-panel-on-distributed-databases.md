Last week at Google I/O, Google’s popular developer conference, Tyler Hannan of Riak was invited to speak on a panel entitled, “Distributed Databases Panel: An Exploration of Approaches and Best Practices.”
During this talk, Tyler and other panelists discussed how modern distributed databases provide high availability, scalability, and fault-tolerance to protect critical data across all industries. In addition to Tyler, this talk featured Julia Ferraioli (Google Compute Engine), Brian Dorsey (Google Developer Relations), Chris Ramsdale (Google Cloud Platform), Mike Miller (Cloudant), and Will Shulman (MongoLab).
