Today I am excited to introduce a new piece of infrastructure to the Riak Community on which we’ve been working: Riak Community Release Notes.
Much like codebases grow and evolve, so does a community and its accomplishments. Why not present and chronicle the community in the same way you would a piece of code? The Riak Community Release Notes are an attempt to do just that.
Each month, we’ll tag and release a new “version” of the Riak Community. The most recent (and first official) release is v0.2. Each release will represent the evolution of the Community as demonstrated by our collective work and activity. For example:

There were more than 20 blog posts about Riak in April
Some of our users raised funding and welcomed new children to their family
We released some (but not enough) new documentation.

My hope is that this will grow into a collaborative effort to track the trajectory of Riak and our user community. It looks somewhat like the Riak Recap, but I think it’ll extend and surpass it in a lot of ways. Most importantly, it’s an experiment, and I’m looking forward to how it evolves. Pull requests, feedback, and criticisms are welcomed.
Thanks for being a part of Riak.
Mark
