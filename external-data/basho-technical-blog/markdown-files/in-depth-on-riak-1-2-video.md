In case you missed the announcement, last month we released Riak 1.2 into the wild. This release was many months in the making and contains bug fixes, performance enhancements, as well as upgrades to operations and cluster management.
Last week at the San Francisco Bay Area Riak Meetup, Andy Gross and Shanley Kane discussed what’s changed in Riak 1.2 and why you should care. In case you were not able to make it, the video of their talk is now online. If you’ve been on the fence about either upgrading to 1.2 or putting a fresh Riak install into production, then this video is for you. The talk is 30 minutes long–consider it a worthwhile investment.
If after watching this video you’re still not convinced, come to RICON on October 10-11. There will be plenty of Riak users and distributed systems experts on hand to answer all your tough questions. Tickets won’t last long, so register now.
Thanks for being a part of Riak.
Tom
