The second episode of Think Distributed, a podcast focused on distributed systems, is now available. This episode discusses causality, vector clocks, version vectors, and CRDTs.
This episode’s panelists are:

Chris Meiklejohn, Software Engineer at Riak Technologies
Peter Bailis, Graduate Student at UC Berkeley
Carlos Baquero, HASLab, INESC Tec and Universidade do Minho
Marek Zawirski, Graduate Student at UPMC-LIP6 / INRIA Paris

In addition to participating on this panel, Peter Bailis will be speaking at RICON West, Riak’s distributed systems conference. His talk, “Bad As I Wanna Be: Coordination and Consistency in Distributed Databases” will discuss how to reason about the trade-offs between coordination, consistency, latency, and availability, with a focus on practical takeaways from recent research both at Berkeley and beyond. RICON West will take place in San Francisco from October 29-30th. Tickets are still available here: ricon-west-2013.eventbrite.com/
