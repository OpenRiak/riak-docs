Last week we aired a live broadcast from our sunny San Francisco offices on searching and accessing data in Riak. This is one of the top things we get questions about – especially from people moving from databases that use other data models or people building new applications on top of Riak.
Slides are below – unfortunately we had some audio quality issues with the video and need to rerecord it for upload. The webinar covers Riak’s full-text search, object tagging and Map Reduce capabilities including:

use cases and features
when NOT to use
query examples
user scenarios
high-level architecture and configuration
hybrid architectures

Check out slides below and make sure to read our docs on the subject.

In the talk, we mention a blog post from Riak user Clipboard on how they optimized Riak Search for their application, which is an awesome way to save and share online content. You can read that blog post here.
