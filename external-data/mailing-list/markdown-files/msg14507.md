Hi,

can I somehow access/format the
/var/lib/riak/anti\_entropy//MANIFEST-0000X file easily so that I
get all bucket/keys out of it? I would like to get somehow all existing
keys (since the last AAE was build on this vnode) without trying to get
it out of the cluster via HTTP /buckets/bucket/keys?keys=stream which
wouldn't be good with our relative big cluster.

Cheers
Simon
