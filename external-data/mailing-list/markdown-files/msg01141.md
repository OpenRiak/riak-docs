Riak Recap for 9/22 - 9/23

1) @ericflo is working on porting Twissandra ---
http://github.com/ericflo/twissandra --- to Riak. He is calling it
"Tweeak" and the code up on GitHub.

Check it out here ---> http://github.com/ericflo/tweeak

2) Q --- If we have an index doc that has thousands or hundreds of
thousands of keys, is it better to write it all at once, or is ok to
build it up incrementally? (form drewr via #riak)

 A --- A single write is probably the best way to go but doing it
incrementally with batched updates would be fine, too.

3) Q --- Is it possible for app.config's "web\_ip" term to have
multiple values? (from andrewoswald via #riak)

 A --- At the moment "0.0.0.0" is your only option. That said,
benblack has just contributed a series of patches that should make
this possible. You can keep an eye on them here:

https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=743
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=744
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=745

(If Benjamin were on the mailing list I would thank him for his
contributions, but he's not, so I won't :)

4) Q --- I just wanted to clarify that the best practice for securing
and authenticating access to a riak cluster would be through something
like nginx using an SSL cert and HTTP authentication? (from adamhunter
via #riak)

 A --- Though this is not directly supported by any of the Riak
client libs at the moment it's generally an acceptable approach.

5) The San Francisco Riak Meetup was last night. Special thanks to
@reverri, @technoweenie and @argv0 for their talks and to all who
attended. I'm working on publishing the talks in some consumable
form...

In the mean time, here is the code that Andy used for his "Riak and
RabbitMQ" talk ---> http://bitbucket.org/argv0/riak\_rabbit
