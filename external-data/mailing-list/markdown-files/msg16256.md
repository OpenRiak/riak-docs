Hi Konstantin,

Please take the delay in response as a :+1: to you being prepared.
Based on your description, the main highlight I see from the reference
material is around the use of app.config [1]:

"If you are using LevelDB and upgrading to 2.0, no special steps need
to be taken, unless you wish to use your old app.config file for
configuration. If so, make sure that you set the
total\_leveldb\_mem\_percent parameter in the eleveldb section of the
file to 70."

There are further considerations for upgrading search, which are all
outlined on that page. Keep us posted on how it goes!
