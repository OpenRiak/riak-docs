Hi all,

I had a bug in my ingestion code that caused sibling explosion in a
specific bucket. I have temporarily turned off allow\_mult=true until that
bug is fixed. Is there a way to remove all of the siblings on those
existing massive objects (up to 10MB) now that allow\_mult is false? Will
Riak do that automatically?

Cheers,

Alain
