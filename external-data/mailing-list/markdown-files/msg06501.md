Last time I benchmarked it, more than a year ago, it didn't make any
meaningful difference in performance. That may have changed, or
perhaps the compilation of Erlang core stuff wasn't done right --
benchmarks/data to the contrary would be welcome.

Generally, I have the feeling (personally) that HiPE is more trouble
than it's worth for \_most\_ use-cases. Kostis will probably have my
head for that. ;)
