I think the way we've said that in the past has been a little misleading. What 
we meant was you can adjust the strictness of your consistency. At it's heart, 
Riak is an AP-style of system, meaning that given a partition, we sacrifice 
consistency first. However, we look at consistency as a spectrum, not as an 
all-or-nothing proposition; you can choose what degree of agreement between 
replicas satisfies a consistent read or write. Behind the scenes, Riak will 
converge on a consistent value over time.
