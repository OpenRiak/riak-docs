Hi Guido. The docs section you referenced is for RiakCS. We do recommend a
substantially higher value for zdbbl when using RiakCS because the object
data being stored is divided into 1MB chunks which is still a relatively
large object size for Riak to handle. Riak used by itself may not need the
value to be that large, but it may benefit depending on the size of objects
you are storing. If you do decide to increase the value beyond 16384, just
proceed with caution and make sure you have enough memory to support the
increased setting.
