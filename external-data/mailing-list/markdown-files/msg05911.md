Vamsi,

It's hard to say without more information. Is the 200% being used by
`beam.smp`? Do you see anything in console.log, error.log or crash.log
that would indicate something odd is happening? Are there clients
communicating with the cluster at the time? If so what client/protocol are
they using and what types of operations are being performed (e.g.
get/put/map reduce/etc)?
