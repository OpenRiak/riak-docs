I want to create a model that I can save to its own bucket, but also be
able to embed it in another model. Is this possible with ripple?

Specifically I want to create a Message model, that I can save and lookup
easily. I also want to embed a copy of that class in a ReceivedMessage
class. I would like to work with these models as such:

message = Message.new
message.body = 'foo'
message.save!

received = ReceivedMessage.new
received.messages << message
received.save!


By doing this I know I have 2 copies of the message, but I'm alright with
that. I'm optimizing for reads not storage space.
My endgame is that I want to look up messages without looking through the
recieved messages, and I want a user to quickly view all received messages
without looking up each individual message.
