Hi, 

I’m running Riak 2.0.2 on Centos 6.5 installed from an RPM 
(http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/riak/2.0/2.0.2/rhel/6/riak-2.0.2-1.el6.x86\_64.rpm)

I’m interested in wiping the entire storage (in order to re-run tests, etc). I 
have a script that traverses buckets/keys but I’m aware that this process is 
costly, plus I might be dealing with some eventual-consistency issues.

Consequently, I would prefer to wipe the “data” directory entirely if that’s in 
any way possible, and re-start Riak. However, the structure seems to be 
scattered in several directories and is not entirely clear which one needs to 
be wiped for a “clean data reset” without corrupting anything:

# ll /var/lib/riak/
total 28
drwxrwxr-x. 66 riak riak 4096 Jan 3 17:29 anti\_entropy
drwxrwxr-x. 66 riak riak 4096 Jan 3 17:29 bitcask
drwxrwxr-x. 3 riak riak 4096 Jan 3 17:28 cluster\_meta
drwxrwxr-x. 2 riak riak 4096 Jan 3 20:07 generated.configs
drwxrwxr-x. 2 riak riak 4096 Jan 3 17:29 kv\_vnode
drwxrwxr-x. 2 riak riak 4096 Jan 4 07:23 riak\_kv\_exchange\_fsm
drwxr-xr-x. 2 riak riak 4096 Jan 3 20:07 ring


Thank you
Cos
