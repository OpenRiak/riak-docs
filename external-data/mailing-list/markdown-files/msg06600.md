A few months ago, we were informed that Luwak would be unmaintained as
of the 1.1 release. I'm wondering, with the impending 1.1 release,
what does the roadmap for storing large files with Riak look like?

I've looked at using S3, Swift, and HDFS - and nothing seems to be as
simple to use as Luwak. (Plus, I admire the dedication that the Basho
team puts on developer experience. And as a one-man team - for the
moment, anyway - my work is much simpler when using Riak.) I've even
looked at using MongoDB's GridFS (but Mongo can be a pain in the ass
to scale out, from what I can see.)

Any news, no matter how speculative, would be appreciated. Those of us
who were planning to use, or are actively using Luwak, just need to
know where the project is headed. Thanks!

Nicholas
