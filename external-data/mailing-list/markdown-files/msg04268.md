Quite a few interesting points, thanks!

Almost totally greenfield, yes. Some data will need to be imported but it's
already in the format described.

Indeed, storage capacity is also an issue but IOPS would be important, too.
I assume that sending batches to Riak (opaque blobs) would help a lot with
the quantity of writes, but it's still a very important point.

You may want to look into ways to force Riak to clean up the bitcask files.

Hm, any references regarding that? It would be a major snag in the whole
schema Riak doesn't properly reclaim space for deleted records.

Indeed, for high frequency sources that would create lots of bundles even
the MaxN to 1 reduction for key names might still generate loads of keys.
Any idea how much RAM Riak requires per record, or a reference that would
point me to it?

My plan was to have the riak\_index contain something like: (id, start\_time,
end\_time, source\_id, record\_count.)

That's roughly the plan, thanks again for your contributions to the
discussion!
