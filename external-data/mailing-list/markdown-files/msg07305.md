Hi,

I'm using leveldb on a 5 node ec2 cluster. I've read about the basic tar 
zipping of leveldb and ring files per node. Also, I read about riak-admin 
backup all.

I'm curious about a couple things. 

1) is the `riak-admin backup all` command non-blocking?

2) is it a consistent backup or is consistency old fashioned thinking?

3) if you use the tar'ing up of leveldb + ring files per node, you lose one 
node, then you restore it from this tar file that is hours or days old, how 
does riak deal with bringing its data up to date?

Thanks Riakers!

Austin
