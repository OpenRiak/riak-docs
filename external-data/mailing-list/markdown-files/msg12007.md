Hi guys,

I am setting up a new Riak cluster and I was wondering if there is any
drawback of increasing the LevelDB blocksize from 4K to 64K. The reason is
that we have all of the values way bigger than 4K and I guess from the
performance point of view it would make sense to increase the block size.
The tests are still running to confirm this theory but I wanted to clarify
that there is no big red flag of doing that from the Riak side. I found the
following discussion about changing block size:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/leveldb/2JJ4smpSC6Q/1Z7aDSeHiRkJ

Is that a good idea to experiment with this in Riak to achieve better
performance?

Thank you in advance,
Istvan
