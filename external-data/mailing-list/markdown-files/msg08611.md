Callixte,

At first glance, your app.config has several issues. Was this app.config
was the one from the SmartOS Riak package, or did you make edits of our
(Basho's) SmartOS package? I'd recommend trying our package
http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/riak/CURRENT/smartos/11/riak-1.2.0-SmartOS-i386.tgzafter
force removal of Joyent's packages. If you don't want to do that,
attached is what a default app.config should look like on SmartOS machine.
 Put that in `/opt/local/etc/riak` and let us know if things get better for
you.

Thanks,
Jared
