How long do you want the systems to run, maintaining security and
bugfix updates for the OS but not API changes that may affect your
application or needing disruptive re-installs? If that might be
important, I'd expect RHEL7/CentOS7 to be a reasonable choice in terms
of the planned end-of-life date.
