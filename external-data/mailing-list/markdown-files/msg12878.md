percent reserved and vnode count: there are two ways to populate the fields

 - set percent reserved in range of 50 to 75% (50 for small number of nodes 
<10, 75 for >10), 
 and set vnode count to your ring size divided by total number of nodes

 - set percent reserved to 10% 
 and set vnode count to your ring size divided by your worst case count of 
nodes after multiple server failures

The first way is the documented method. The second is what I have been using 
more recently.

No. AAE does not use your max\_open\_file count. It has a static allocation of 
10 to minimize impact.

Yes. The two values in 1.2 were used to estimate overhead for bloom filters. 
Bloom filter sizes and accounting completely changed in 1.3. Made my life 
simpler.

Yes. 

Side note: never mess with the write buffer min and max size … unless 
something is really, really wrong … or you have almost no RAM. There are 
several internal tunings based upon those assumed sizes.
