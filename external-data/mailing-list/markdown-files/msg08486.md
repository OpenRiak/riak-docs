This weekend I found myself making a bunch of small adjustments to JSON 
documents as I was prototyping some things and kept making mistakes with my 
JSON documents and the CLI. I solved the problem by writing a quick graphical 
browser. Since it lists keys and buckets it isn't really intended to be used 
on production systems, but worked well for me on a development install.

If someone else would find this useful, it's here:
