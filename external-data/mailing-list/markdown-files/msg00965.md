Hi,

I'm new to riak, and have been busily reading though the wiki, watching the
videos, and catching up on the mail list, so I will have lots of questions
over the next few weeks - so sorry 

To begin, I'm curious about the characteristics of the seven backends for
riak [1]

 1. riak\_kv\_bitcask\_backend - stores data to bitcask
 2. riak\_kv\_fs\_backend - stores data directly to files in a nested
 directory structure on disk
 3. riak\_kv\_ets\_backend - stores data in ETS tables (which makes it
 volatile storage, but great for debugging)
 4. riak\_kv\_dets\_backend - stores data on-disk in DETS tables
 5. riak\_kv\_gb\_trees\_backend - stores data using Erlang gb\_trees
 6. riak\_kv\_cache\_backend - turns a bucket into a memcached-type memory
 cache, and ejects the least recently used objects either when the cache
 becomes full or the object's lease expires
 7. riak\_kv\_multi\_backend - configure per-bucket backends

Unfortunately this amount of choice means I need to do my homework to make
an informed decision ;-) so I'd love any pointers or to hear any advice on
performance comparisons, best practices, backends for development vs
deployment etc

Kind Regards

Neville
