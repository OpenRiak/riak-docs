Daniel -

The client doesn't support modifying / creating those properties for
buckets themselves in Riak. This is a server-side limitation as Riak itself
doesn't support these operations via protocol buffers.

With Object reads / writes, however, there is no issue.

The DomainBucket object is a convenience object for when you want the same
settings for all reads / writes. You can specify them in the Builder:

DomainBucket domainBucket =
 DomainBucket.builder(myBucket,
ShoppingCart.class).r(1).pr(1).w(1).build();

All calls to fetch() and store() will use those settings.

In your case, if you want only some fetch / store operations to use
alternate settings you have a couple options.

1) Create a second DomainBucket object with those alternate settings. You
can then use that DomainBucket object only for operations you want those
settings to apply to.

2) Don't use the DomainBucket wrapper and instead use the regular Bucket
interface. You can set those properties int the StoreObject and
FetchObject.

Thanks,
Brian Roach
