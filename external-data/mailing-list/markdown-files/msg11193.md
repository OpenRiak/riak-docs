Hi All,

As far as I know, before introducing Active Anti Enthropy (AAE) mechanism
in Riak 1.3 changing of replication factor (number of replicas, N) was not
recommended - it could cause "object not found" errors.
Could I use setting notfound\_ok = false to avoid these errors (and actually
fix it using read repair)?
Is something was changed introducing AAE? It still not recommended? Is it
possible to forcefully run AAE over all cluster to fix all errors after
changing replication factor?

Thanks a lot
