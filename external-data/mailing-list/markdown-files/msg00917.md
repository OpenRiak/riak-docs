I'm pretty sure all 3 physical nodes are not garaunteed to have a 
replica. I think the algo is n-1 as long as you have at least n nodes.


Not sure about the shutdown thing though, although I don't think it's 
a big deal.

I'm curious. Let's say I only setup 3 riak nodes. and I leave n to 3.
This means of course, all 3 nodes have a copy of the full set of data,
due to n being 3.

What happens if I then do riak stop on all 3 nodes at the same time?
Each node will
try to hand off data to the others before going down, but I'm shutting
them down all
at the same time. Do they give up because they don't have anyone to
hand it over to?
