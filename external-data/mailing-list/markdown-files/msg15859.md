Hi Zeeshan,

We have typically seen this issue when we have lots of indexes created in
that instance. On a t2.medium machine we already have around 512+ indexes
created in data folder. In such case, if we trying to create any new
indexes it's taking time. Association of Index to Bucket is failing even
after the FetchIndex operation returning sucess as shown in the below code.

is there any limitation of the number of Indexes? Any thing related to
FileSystem handlers causing this issue?

while(!isCreated){

 FetchIndex fetchIndex = new FetchIndex.Builder(indexName).build();

 
RiakFuture fetchIndexFuture = client.executeAsync(fetchIndex);

 try{

 fetchIndexFuture.await();

 com.basho.riak.client.core.operations.YzFetchIndexOperation.Response
response = fetchIndexFuture.get();

 List indexes = response.getIndexes();

 for(YokozunaIndex index:indexes){

 if(indexName.equals(index.getName())){

 isCreated=true;

 logger.info("Index "+indexName+" created ");

 continue;

 }

 }

 }catch(Exception e){

 logger.warn("Unable to get "+indexName+" Still trying");

 isCreated=false;

 }

 }
