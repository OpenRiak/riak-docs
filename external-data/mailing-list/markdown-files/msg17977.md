Darshan,

Magnus has stolen my thunder and words! I agree that your use case, as
outlined by Magnus above, is not one Riak is aimed at. In fact, given you
want to persist data on an embedded device, are you sure you even want the
overhead of a "database"? There are the options Magnus mentioned above,
also you may want to look at:

http://www.yaffs.net/fuel-embedded-database-use-yaffs
http://www.mcobject.com/emb

I have not used either, but they may give you ideas.

In my embedded/IoT work I have not used the embedded device as a persistent
store, I have buffered readings on the edge devices but I have then, when a
connection is made, sent them to processing hubs.

Kind regards
Stephen
