Hi Mark,

Currently maps are contained in a single key. The same warnings we give for
value sizes in regular KV apply; however, the map has additional contained
metadata that will give an approximately linear overhead (per-embedded
type) to the object.

If you can constrain the various domains of your incoming data so as to box
it in something small enough (~1MB or less), by all means use a map, but it
is not a general solution for time-series data.
