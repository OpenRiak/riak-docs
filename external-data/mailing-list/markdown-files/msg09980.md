The issue is not present in Ruby (at least on 1.9 or newer, 1.8 can be
sketchy). Instead of having different types for unicode and ascii
strings, they are all just String. The difference is that they have an
encoding attached and can automatically be transcoded to a different
format.

Furthermore, the Ruby client uses MultiJson[1], which allows one to
select which codec library to use, either for performance or
compatibility reasons.
