There is now a second update available for 2.9.0:
https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0p2.

This patch, like the patch before, resolves a memory management issue in
leveled, which this time could be triggered by sending many large objects
in a short period of time. The underlying problem is described a bit
further here https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/issues/285, and is
resolved by leveled working more sympathetically with the beam binary
memory management.

Switching to the patched version is not urgent unless you are using the
leveled backend, and may send a large number of large objects in a burst.

Updated packages are available (thanks to Nick Adams at TI Tokyo) -
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.9/2.9.0p2/

Thanks again to the testing team at the NHS Spine project, Aaron Gibbon
(BJSS) and Ramen Sen, who discovered the problem. The issue was discovered
in a handoff scenario where there were a tens of thousands of 2MB objects
stored in a portion of the keyspace at the end of the handoff - which led
to memory issues until either more PUTs were received (to force a persist
to disk) or a restart occurred..

Regards
