Hi Venki,

I know this email is about two months late, but I figured it was worth
responding to as I've had this response as a draft for the last 60 or
days or so. :)

At any rate, it \*looks\* like you are (or were) hitting this:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/issues/290

It has been patched and will be fixed in the 1.3 release of Riak which
is slated for release towards the middle of January (if all goes to
plan).
