Getting riak running in DC/OS was great - nice an easy with good
documentation.

But I'm having an issue with the riak-mesos-director (
https://github.com/basho-labs/riak-mesos-director)

I opened an issue on this repo but it looks like the maintainer doesn't
work for basho?

Anyway it seems the new datatypes in riak (sets, counters, hlls) don't work
through the director.

I assume its a pretty easy fix, so I just wanted to bring it to the
attention of someone at basho

Thanks
