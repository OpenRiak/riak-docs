 - Is it possible to use the built-in backup/restore functions of
 riak-admin to copy data between clusters? The scenario is that we have
 separate test and production environments, each with separate riak clusters
 of different sizes and configurations. Every so often we'd like to copy the
 data from production into test. Can I run 'backup all' in prod, then run
 restore on the resultant file in test, and have everything work? Or does
 restore only work on the same cluster configuration that the backup was
 performed on? What's the easiest way of doing this?


 - I've noticed that backup takes a very long time, and results in a file
 that is much larger than the actual cluster data directories of the cluster.
 Is this normal?


 - Not related to backups, but how do I configure the global replication
 count of the cluster?
