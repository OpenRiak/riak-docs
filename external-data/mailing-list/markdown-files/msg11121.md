If you're going to use the withoutFetch() method it is required that
you use that @RiakVClock annotated field in your class - you need to
store the vclock from when you fetched in that field.

When you call StoreObject.execute() it is extracted from your object
and passed to the Converter.fromDomain() method. Since you're using
your own Converter, in that method you need to store the vclock in the
IRiakObject you're constructing and returning. The RiakObjectBuilder
has a withVClock method (and of course the DefaultRiakObject
constructor takes it as a parameter).

As for your second question ... yeah, MapReduce doesn't have that.
It's probably something worth thinking about for a future release (and
yeah, I'm pretty much in charge of the Java client right now - I'll
add it to my backlog).

As-is the best suggestion I would have is using the
MapReduceResult.getResultRaw() and then pass that String to your own
code for conversion.

Thanks!

(BTW - I apologize for the late reply - your original email was caught
up in our listserv server for some reason and I only received it
today).
