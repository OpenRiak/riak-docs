Thanks Johns...

Our main interface into Riak is via Erlang, we just like the HTTP for the
Big Green Check mark that tells us the cluster is ok.

What we'll probably do for now then is turn off the HTTP(S) interfaces and
write a little clone of sorts for the status.

It would be good if looking at least one of these could make it into the
backlog - being able to accidentally DOS yourself is a bit of a weakness...
