Hello,

"Bucket creation is one of the operations handled by 'stanchion'. So,
make sure you've install stanchion installed on only one node and that
all riak-cs nodes are pointing at that one stanchion node."

Look like a single point of failure.
In current version situation is same?

Regards,
Mikhail.
