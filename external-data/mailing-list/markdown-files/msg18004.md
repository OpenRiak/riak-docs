Hi all,

I'm new to Riak and trying to figure out how to work with CRDTs properly.
First of all, I decided to try MVRegister support. I'm using this tutorial
http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.0/developing/data-types/maps/. Language
of my choice is Java.

Find source code here:
https://gist.github.com/andrershov/d0ebb8fd111eca013b302f8abaf14445

I've created ahmedMap with two registers (name="Ahmed", phone="123")
Now I would like to simulate that there are two concurrent updates to phone
register
phone="456" and phone="789"

For that, I'm fetching initial record and get context from it. After that,
I'm performing two updates passing the same context to each one.
I'm expecting that after fetching the record and reading the phone
register, I should find two concurrent values in it: phone = ("456",
"789"). But I get only the latest value phone = "789".
Also Register API seems confusing, because there is no method inside it
that may return multiple values.


Could you please help me?
