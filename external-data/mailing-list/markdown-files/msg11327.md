Good to see that you working on steadily improving performance and fixing bugs. 
Can you confirm that https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/334 again didn't 
make it into the release? A customer of mine has had big trouble because of 
this bug. Thankfully the PR was closed 5 month ago, but applying the patch 
manually over and over again is not really a great fun. I'd really love to see 
that this issue get's closed.

If you just missed in the release notes, ignore what I wrote :)


Best
