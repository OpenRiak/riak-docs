I have a search that boils down to this...

search-cmd search zids "facebook\_credential\_keys:591006980"

We have five servers behind a load balancer and at least one of them seems to 
fail that search. I am storing Oauth credentials in Riak for each user; at 
least one server fails and the failure leads to a crash in our single-sign-on 
server.
