Thanks Alex - I've been researching this today and looking at the
implications because it appears I have to change the storage backend in
order to enable it - additionally the python client library isn't up to date
with this feature so it means merging in dev code to get access to it - so
I'm not doing header manipulation inside my code alongside library calls.

So now I have to consider whether additional benefit of doing this (and
other potential opportunities it creates) overweighs the changes needing to
be made to the system to get it working.

Cheers
Andrew
