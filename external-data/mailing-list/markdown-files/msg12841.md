Hi,

All you say is valid and I understand the reasons. However, if you
have limited bandwidth between your servers, say 100mbit, which at the
same time is shared with the Internet connection, things will be slow.

There are cases where you want the client to do the quorum instead of
the server to minimize bandwidth usage. Of course this will sacrify
some availability as some requests might fail.

As Riak targets high availability, I understand that this might not be
something you want to do. Like I said, I am just looking around for
options :)

I have seen that WeedFS seems to do something close to what I want.
Apparently it is modelled after Facebook's Haystack.

Regards,
Daniele
