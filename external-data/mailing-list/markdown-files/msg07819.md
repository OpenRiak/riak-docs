We're running smoothly behind nginx in a round robin config. One thing
to remember is eventual consistency... So, if you have two very quick
serial operations, one dependent on the results of the other, be sure
to make sure both requests are hitting the same node. Also, it was
necessary to bypass the lb for any streaming keys operation.
