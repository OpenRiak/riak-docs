Riak Recap for May 09 - 10
====================


1) We added a new page to the wiki aimed at helping people better
estimate what sizes their Riak clusters should be. It definitely needs
some refining, so try it out and file a GitHub Issue against the wiki
repo if you think there is something that needs improving/fixing.

\* Take it for a spin here --->
http://wiki.basho.com/Bitcask-Capacity-Planning.html

2) Some code-related news for Riak Search fans: we just recently made
merge\_index, the Riak Search backend, a stand alone piece of code.
(You can thank Ryan Zezeski for this.) Time permitting, we'll be
trying to get some docs out the door for this.

Code here on GitHub ---> https://github.com/basho/merge\_index

3) v0.9.4 of Ripple is out!

\* All the details here --->

4) Another reminder about the inaugural Riak Meetup happening in NYC on 5/18:

\* Details here http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Riak-Meetup/

It was also just announced that Basho CTO Justin Sheehy will be
speaking at this Meetup...

5) Another Reminder About the Erlang Meetup in Washington DC on 5/17
where Rusty Klophaus will be speaking:
