Good morning/afternoon/evening Riak users!

I've released riak-ruby-client 1.4.1 moments ago. This version of the gem fixes 
a few minor bugs and issues.

Issues:

\* Test for object existence using head request, reported and fixed by
 Elias "eliaslevy" Levy in https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/pull/102

Bugfixes:

\* License missing from gemspec, reported by Benjamin "bf4" Fleischer
 in https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/pull/108

\* Issue when reading Git-based version numbers, reported and fixed by
 jacepp in https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/pull/120

The Ruby gem is ready to go at
