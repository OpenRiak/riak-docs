Hi,

I setup a 3 machine riak SM cluster. Each machine used 4GB Ram and riak
OpenSource SmartMachine Image.

Afterwards I tried loading data by following two methods
1. Bash script
#!/bin/bash
echo $(date)
for (( c=1; c<=1000; c++ ))
do
curl -s -d 'this is a test' -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test/keys
done
echo $(date)

2. Python Riak Client
c=riak.RiakClient("10.112.2.185")
b=c.bucket("test")
for i in xrange(10000):o=b.new(str(i), str(i)).store()

For case 1, throughput was 25 writes/sec
For case 2, throughput was 200 writes/sec

Maybe I am making a fundamental mistake somewhere. I tried the above two
scripts on EC2 clusters too and still got the same performance.

Please, someone help

Thanks,
Yousuf Fauzan
