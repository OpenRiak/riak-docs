Hi,

Just as a random question, how important is non-blocking retrieval of
object to riak? I don't think it's built in to clients such as the
riak-python-client.

Is that something that's used or it just doesn't matter when things go
bigger?

(So for example bucket.get("key") will not return the object, but you must
pass a callback to get it)

Cheers,

Shuhao
