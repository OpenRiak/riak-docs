Ive got no idea why their dropping support, Ive even built ports/packages
and commited them to the FreeBSD ports tree, which i also plan to do for
RIAK TS, Ive completed and commited RIAK KV, Stanchion and RIAK CS are
already to the ports tree. I think their decision for dropping support is a
bit short sighted as there are commercial vendors and companies using it in
production of the FreeBSD platofmr, souind to me kind of like shooting
themselves in the foot.
