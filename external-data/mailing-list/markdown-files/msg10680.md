Brisa,

You cannot simulate transactions, really (see also
http://aphyr.com/posts/254-burn-the-library). However, if you want to
receive notifications and take action when something happens, you can
add a postcommit hook (see
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/appendices/concepts/Commit-Hooks/).
In the past, developers have added hooks that push updates into a
RabbitMQ broker or ZeroMQ channel.
