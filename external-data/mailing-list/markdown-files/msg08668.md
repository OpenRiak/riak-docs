Hello Martin,

There are some documentation resources which might help you get up to speed on 
Riak Search, and which definitely answer some of your questions:

2. http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Schema.html
3. http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Indexing.html
4. http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Indexing-and-Querying-Riak-KV-Data.html
5. http://wiki.basho.com/Configuration-Files.html#riak\_search-settings

Some videos on Riak Search which might also help:

I hope this helps to get you.
