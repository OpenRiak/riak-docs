Hi,

Thanks for the reply.

There were a lot of useful details there, but the thing I need to reply to, I
think, is the whole question of whether the map step is combining multiple
images, or processing a single image.

The number of calibrations (in the sense I used that term) is always small.
I'll explain why below (I'm not putting the text here because it's long and
more about astronomy than computing). So I am considering them as "constants"
that are somehow present on every node. Somewhere in the Riak docs I thought
I found some mention of a map step that cached a linked value locally. I
can't find that now, but I thought this might be how the calibration was
pulled across initially.

Does the above address your concern? So rather than

 fetch one image > fetch another image > mutate > write output

I see something more like:

 move to where the image is >
 fetch calibration if this this is the first image on this node >
 mutate the image > write output

Does that improve things?

Here's the argument why the number of calibration images does not scale
with the number of observation images:

Astronomy is observing time limited. The number of telescopes is small
compared to the number of astronomers. Furthermore, new discoveries are made
by pushing limits - either by observing new objects (which means looking at
faint objects, since bright ones are already well-studied, and so requires a
lot of observing time) or by doing large statistical samples (which requires a
lot of observing time) or by looking at something in more detail (which means
restricting spatial or frequency ranges, and so implies less photons and
requires a lot of observing time). In every case, instruments and observing
processes must spend as much time as possible obtaining observation images.
This forces calibration images to be made at the start/end of the night. So a
small number of calibrations are applied to many observations.

The above is simplified, but hopefully it gives the general idea. What is new
in my email (if anything) is not the general approach, but the idea that
"commodity" software can be used rather than developing dedicated pipeline
software for a particular instrument (along with the idea that you can create
provenance graphs and reuse data in a similar way to pure data structures).
