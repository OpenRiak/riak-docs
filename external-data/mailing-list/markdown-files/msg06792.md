Vijayakumar,

I'm not able to reproduce any odd behavior using the same calls with a 3 node 
cluster and storing/retrieving a String (tested both HTTP and ProtocolBuffers). 

When you say "records are not reflected", what do you mean exactly? 

Is the value in your returned IRiakObject null (meaning the key was not found), 
 just an empty String / Byte[], or there's something there but it's not the 
value you expected?

Also, what release version of Riak are you using?

Thank You,
Brian Roach
