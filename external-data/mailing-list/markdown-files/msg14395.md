Where does the ping\_node executable/shell script come from? The FreeBSD 
1.4.9 port of riak starts successfully but says it doesn't (and can't be 
shut down), and it looks like it's because that program is missing. 
Commenting out the STDOUT/STDERR redirect in the wait loop results in a 
bunch of '=ERROR: not found' messages.


Is it supposed to be included with erlang or some erlang package I'm 
missing?
