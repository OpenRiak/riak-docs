Hey list,

we just encountered an odd behavior on our production cluster while adding 5 
extra nodes.

We ran riak-admin cluster join  on all new nodes. When we wanted to 
take a look at the plan (riak-admin cluster plan), but nothing was staged. 
member-status revealed that the join was already in progress and partition 
transfers were running.

This was not really a problem, everything went fine as far as we can tell right 
now, but we were a bit surprised that we did not need to commit the staged 
cluster change. What could have happened here? Anything we could have 
overlooked?



Best

Sebastian
