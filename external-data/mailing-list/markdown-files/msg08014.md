Hi,

I'm playing with Riak thanks to working through the Seven DBs in Seven
Weeks book: .
One of the examples has left me confused, and I wondered if anyone could
spot where I'm going wrong.

I've got a dev cluster running Riak 1.1.4, and have turned on Riak search. I've
created a bucket named new\_animals and added the following 3 objects:

$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:8091/riak/new\_animals/dragon \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"nickname" : "Dragon", "breed" : "Briard", "score" : 1 }'
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:8091/riak/new\_animals/ace \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"nickname" : "The Wonder Dog", "breed" : "German Shepherd",
"score" : 3 }'
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:8091/riak/new\_animals/rtt \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"nickname" : "Rin Tin Tin", "breed" : "German Shepherd", "score" : 4 }'

Now I try to search using the and operator:

$ curl 
'http://localhost:8091/solr/new\_animals/select?q=nickname:Rin%20breed:Shepherd&q.op=and'
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?


0
4

on
0
nickname:Rin breed:Shepherd
and

value
standard
1.1
2




rtt
 
German Shepherd
 
Rin Tin Tin
 
4
 


ace
 
German Shepherd
 
The Wonder Dog
 
3
 




I expected only one result to match, but have two. 'ace' should fail
to match the nickname:Rin term, so does it make sense that it's returned
for this query?

Cheers,

Mick
