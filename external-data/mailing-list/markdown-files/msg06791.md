Hi

If I have N=3 and writing with PR=quorum, PW=quorum and there is network
partitioning so that 2 primary replicas are not available (or are down)
write will fail. But I guess it's still possible (or rather certain) that
3rd primary replica have written that data. Is that correct?
If that's the case, what's the best way to deal with such a situation?
Ideally I would like to delete that entry and make sure it won't be visible
to other nodes.
Is that possible? Or would delete fail because PR's quorum is not met? If
one primary replica came back would next read (for example delete)
read-repair the entry? 

I've read:

but I'm still not sure what to expect.

Thanks
Daniel
