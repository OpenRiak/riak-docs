Hi,

I am not able to figure out how to get the highlighting to work.
I am using 2.0.0beta1 which states that it supports highlighting - but it
seems not really documented besides the reference to the Solr documentation.
I am using the Python client.

The documentation states that I need to set hl=true. But where?
It doesn't seem to be one of the parameters that the method search accepts
(looked in the source code).

How do I get that parameter into the search?

Can anyone provide an example?
