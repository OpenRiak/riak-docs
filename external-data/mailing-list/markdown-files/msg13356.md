Vagrant (https://github.com/basho/vagrant-riak-cluster) will probably be
not so great for performance but you won't notice that until you need too
(map reduce will suck). Once your cluster needs grow, migrating your nodes
to physical boxes shouldn't be hard. Consider and uneven split on 2 boxes
(3/2).
