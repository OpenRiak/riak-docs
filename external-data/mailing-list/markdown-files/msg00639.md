Hi Germain,

I'm sorry if I've missed any background information that may have been
provided earlier but can you tell me the scenario that led up to these
errors? Are you running a load test against a cluster? Are you seeing these
out of memory errors in one of your nodes? How much memory does the machine
running the node have? What type of load is being placed on the node (get,
put, map reduce, etc.)?

If you are using the Bitcask backend, which is default in the latest
release, you should be aware that all keys held on the node must fit in
memory (this does NOT include the values, just the keys). Here is a related
discussion from IRC:
http://gist.github.com/438065

Also worth reviewing is this discussion from the mailing list:
http://riak.markmail.org/search/?q=bitcask%20key%20memory#query:bitcask%20key%20memory+page:1+mid:2rreshpri7laq57h+state:results

Thank you,
Dan
