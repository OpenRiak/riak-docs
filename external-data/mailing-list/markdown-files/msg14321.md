Toby,

While there is mention of it on the riak-admin page [1], in the upcoming
2.0 release `riak-admin backup` has been deprecated. The documentation you
linked contains the suggested ways for backing up your cluster at this
time. There are many ongoing discussions about providing a first-class
backup solution as part of riak(-admin) again but, right now, I do not have
many more details on how it would work or when it will be available.
