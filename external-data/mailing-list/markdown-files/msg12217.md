Riak Users,

The ninth release of Yokozuna has arrived. It is now integrated with the
Riak development branch. This means no more special merge branches and you
get the latest and greatest Riak code. It also means Yokozuna is on track
to be delivered with the next release of Riak. There is now support for
index and schema administration over protocol buffers. A major performance
regression was fixed. An AAE deadlock issue was fixed. And work has
started for Riak Search migration. For a full list of changes see the
release notes.

For installation instructions see the INSTALL doc.
