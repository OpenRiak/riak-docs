If you've been trying the map-reduce page on the wiki's Fast Track module in 
the last few days, you may have had problems loading the data or getting any 
results from the map-reduce queries. It seems when we uploaded the CSV, it had 
been opened in Excel beforehand, which changed the date format. I've uploaded 
a new version of the stock data CSV and also a downloadable version of the 
data-loading script (in Erlang and Ruby).

I hope this helps!
