Hello,

A noob question: why does this work?
curl "http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=title:Ti\*"

..but not any of these?
curl "http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=title:T\*"
curl "http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=title:\*"
curl "http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=\*"

I can't use the getAll-feature, there is too much data. Doing a
map/reduce to get the first 10 items from a bucket seems overkill.

I'd like to do something like 'curl
"http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=\*&rows=10&start=0"' but
it does not seem to work.

Any tips?
