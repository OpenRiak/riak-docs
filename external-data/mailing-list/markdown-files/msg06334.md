The Erlang PB client gives and takes secondary index information as
binaries in some places and strings in others. For example
riakc\_pb\_socket:get\_index/4 wants the Index and Key as binaries.
Retrieving the index information from the meta data of an object read
out of Riak gives the Index and Key as strings.

Can strings and binaries be used interchangeable for indexes
throughout the API? Or is is such that the representation inside of a
riak\_obj is a strings, but API functions want it as binaries?

The inconsistency is a bit of a nuisance. In testing of some of my
application's logic I'm setting an index on a new object using binary
values, I query the index using the binary values, but when I read it
back they're strings.
