I wonder if you have some keys that are hanging around on one of the N 
partitions but are deleted elsewhere (and the tombstones reaped?). 2i uses 
coverage which is essentially r=1 on a covering set of vnodes. But you think 
read-repair/AAE would bring convergence, so it is perplexing. I wonder if we 
can get a look at the “phantom” keys. Either via r=1 GET or some attach to 
console, get directly from the backend magic.
