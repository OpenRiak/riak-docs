Hello

I'm using Riak 1.4.9 Advanced Search. I have a simple schema for indexing some 
companies:

{
 schema, [
 {version, 1.1},
 {n\_val, 3},
 %% Defaults to noop\_analyzer\_factory, string
 {analyzer\_factory, {erlang, text\_analyzers, 
noop\_analyzer\_factory}} ],
 [
 {field, [ {name, id} ]},
 {field, [ {name, company} ]},
 {field, [ {name, name}, {analyzer\_factory, {erlang, 
text\_analyzers, standard\_analyzer\_factory}} ]},
 {field, [ {name, kpostcode} ]},
 {dynamic\_field, [ {name, "\*"}, {skip, true} ]}
 ]
}.

An example of an update:



515363fa-cc06-46c7-a43a-a725f7988e2b
99999999
MY TEST COMPANY 
MY TEST L1
 MY TEST L2
SOMETOWN
WC1D 6DD


http://localhost/solr/namechg/select?q=company:99999999


515363fa-cc06-46c7-a43a-a725f7988e2b
99999999
MY TEST COMPANY


The address fields are missing in the response? I thought that these fields 
were stored but not indexed?

{dynamic\_field, [ {name, "\*"}, {skip, true} ]}

Thanks
