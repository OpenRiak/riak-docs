I'm happy to announce a freshly squeezed release of the Python client for Riak 
[1]. Other than a couple of bugfixes it includes some neat new features 
contributed by the community.

Here's a handy list of the noteworthy ones:

\* A nicer API for using key filters with MapReduce, check out the README for 
examples [2] (Eric Moritz)
\* Support storing new objects without having to specify a key (Mark Erdmann)
\* Handy function aliases for the Riak built-in MapReduce functions (Eric Moritz)
\* Add a convenience method to create Riak object directly from file (Ana Nelson)
\* Support return\_body parameter when creating a new object (Stefan 
Praszalowicz, Andy Gross)

It includes a nice bunch of bug fixes and smaller improvements as well, they're 
all listed in the release notes [3].

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, keep those pull requests 
coming!
