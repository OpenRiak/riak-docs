They might indeed be on your system, but are simply not in your LD path so the 
linker doesn't know where to look for them. One thing that is curious though, 
those last links are the 32bit libstdc++ libraries, are you on a 32bit system? 
 If not, you might not have the 64bit c++ libraries installed. In my case, I 
have the libraries you have, as well as:

/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.16


If you do indeed want to link to the 32bit versions, make sure the linker is 
looking for that path.

env | grep LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH

If it is not, just add it in your start up scripts (defaulted to ~/.bashrc for 
ubuntu/mint)

export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:your\_additional\_path


Hope that helps,
Jared
