Hey Greg,

So here's what looks like is going on:

Everything that requires JS in Riak has to declare a pool of VMs. Each
pool needs to be initialized for functions that depend on them to have
access. In this case, it looks like the Riak Search custom extractor
functionality depends on a pool that's not being initialized. This
would be "riak\_search\_js\_extract". Sorry for the time you've spent
toiling with this, but it looks like it's a bug.

I've gone ahead and filed an issue on your behalf.

https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1144

Please add any additional details that you think would be worthwhile,
and thanks for uncovering this.

Mark
