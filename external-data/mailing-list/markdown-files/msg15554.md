2i does not currently support CRDTs; however MapReduce and Yokozuna do.

MapReduce contains no first class support for CRDTs, but I would imagine that 
you could write an Erlang MapReduce job to iterate the data structures 
directly; this is suboptimal, but should be possible.

Search has first class support, and has Solr extractors for all of the data 
types. You can use this to simulate 2i behavior with Yokozuna.

Here’s an example in Erlang of how to use YZ with CRDTs:
