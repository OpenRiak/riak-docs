Hi,

We had an issue in 1.4 where 2i operations were timing out, after going 
through support we were suggested to use "+zdbbl 16384", on the 
"Configuring Riak Docs" it is strongly suggested (unless doc need to be 
re-phrased) it should be higher:


\*Source:\* 
http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/configuration/Configuring-Riak/


At the end of such doc there is the following fragment and we would like 
to know if there is a kind of all situations balanced value and the 
implications:



 Performance & Capacity settings

It is strongly recommended that the following values be set in the Riak 
|vm.args| configuration file, which is located in the |/etc/riak| or 
|/opt/riak/etc| folder.


## This setting is not present in default Riak installations, so
## it should be added. In some cases, a value of 128000 may be
## appropriate.
+zdbbl96000

## This setting is present in default Riak installations, so
## its value should be edited.
-env ERL\_MAX\_PORTS16384



Kind regards,

Guido.
