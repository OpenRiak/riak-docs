Hello, I love the idea of an s3 alternative and was wondering if there was
anyway to use my s3 acces and secret keys with riak-cs. I tried
substituting my keys for the generated ones in both riak-cs and stanchion
app.config files to no avail.

Thanks for any help you can provide, and if I posted in the wrong place
place please point me in the right direction.

Kindly


Spiro
