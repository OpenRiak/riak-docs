Hey,

I have two instances, a client and a server. On the server I installed
Riak. My application (using the Java-API) is running on the client
instance. I would like to read and write some data to the server
instance. My IP address and port in the app.config on the server
instance is 127.0.0.1 and 8098. Then what does the url I give to my
HttpRiakClient in my application looks like? Is it
"http://ip-address-of-my-server-instance:8098/riak" ? Do I have to
change something else? For example allow access from other instances?

I would be very thankful for any kind of advice :)
Cheers,
Maria
