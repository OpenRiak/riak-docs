Hi Ilya

Read “quorum” is unusual and a bit against the idea of distributed DB, but I 
believe what you might find useful is enabling strong consistency, which you 
can then chose to apply at a bucket(type) level:
\* http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/strong-consistency/

One of the reasons we chose Riak is precisely the fact that you can silo your 
data into “consistent” and “available” within the same cluster. An important 
thing to remember is that with strong consistency enabled you will need a 
minimum of 3 nodes (yes, for your dev environment too), otherwise writes to 
strong-consistent buckets will fail.

Another relevant note here about strong consistency in Riak (and distributed DB 
in general): is not so much about the performance impact, but more about 
sacrificing availability to achieve this.
(The C vs A in the CAP theorem, if we are to oversimplify this)

Regards
Cos
