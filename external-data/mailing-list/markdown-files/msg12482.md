I think this is just an area that hasn't been addressed unlike things like
a "hot" copy in the rdbms world..
I think at least a plan for how a hotcopy tool for a riak core semantics
database system
could be made would be a good step in the right direction, ie.. maybe a
combination of
specifying a target system to transfer to, then converge the source ring ie
5 nodes to 1..
having a riak\_backup\_vnode with a batch put fsm, that transfers 1-10mb's
worth of keys to
another riak system's vnode compressed with crc checks and writes directly
to leveldb.
Or a wiki of some sort outlining possible strategies for achieving this.

The current backup approach is not at all the way it could or should be.
