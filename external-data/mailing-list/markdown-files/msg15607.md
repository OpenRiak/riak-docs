Hi Eric,

Thanks for the detailed explanations..

Yes, we are using Yokozuna.

Regarding the 4th option, which seems the ideal one, is that feature
already released? If not, I'd say the 3rd one would be the best one,
instead of reading and writing back all the keys.

I'm pretty new to Riak, just wondering - is AAE active by default or do we
have to activate it?

Our version of Riak is: \*2.0.0-7-g547f0e0\*

Cheers!
