Hi there,

I am trying to make some stress test and want to see behaivour of the 
riaksearch. 

My setup: 

3 riak search machine :

1x 8 cores 8 gig 
1x2 core 8 gig
1x2 core 2 gig 

An there is another machine for load balance (nginx)

I indexed 150K document (from web . ) I made test via Jmeter sendign request 
like ..../solr/testdata/select?start=0&rows=10&..

first test :

Sending queries to the only 1x8 core machines... 25 threads from Jmeter...

I got aprox: 50 q/ps and cpu utilization around %85 no io. 


When I send the request to the load balance machine which it is distributing 
queries above server ( 8 cores machines weight = 20 ps) I got:

44 qps...

So it is telling someting to me but i am not clear... Is riak search also 
routing request as load balancer does ? 

Any idea about above situation ? 


I want to make test via wikipedia also with million doc.. By the way is there 
any parser for wikipedia to submit riaksearch ? 


Regards
