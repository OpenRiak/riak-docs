Riak Users,

We are pleased to announce the release of Riak 1.1.2. This is another bug fix 
release on the 1.1.x series of Riak. In particular 1.1.2 fixes several issues 
users on the riak-users mailing list reported, so thanks to those who have 
given feedback and worked with our Dev and DA teams to track down issues. 

Please take a look at the release notes for a list of the bugs fixed, 
especially if you had prior concerns over running a mixed cluster while 
upgraded to the 1.1.x version of Riak.
