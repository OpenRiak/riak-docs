Hi all,

I have a need to index on two separate fields in a json document - rather,
I need to concatenate the two and index on that.

Short of duplicating both into a single new item in my json document, how
would I go about doing that?

Example:

Given this JSON:

{ "parent": "/path/to/parent",
 "self": "myname"
}

How would I build a schema that would search on "/path/to/parent/myname"
without doing something like:

{ "parent": "/path/to/parent",
 "self": "myname",
 "fullpath": "/path/to/parent/myname"
}

Thanks,
Michael Martin
