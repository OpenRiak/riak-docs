oops! hit send too early.

4. What is your Riak cluster setup? (eg. how many nodes, configuration 
setteings, etc).
 We have 4 nodes installed in a virtual machine each having 1 core and 2 GB 
RAM.

Pandiarajan,

Can you please answer some questions for me:

 1. What is your application architecture? Are you consuming CI as a 
transport from WCF or are you calling CI from a RESTful server?
My application has multi-tier architecture. I do have web service tier, 
Business tier and then the Data tier. In the Data tier, I have the Corrugated 
iron reference and from this tier I communicate with Riak which is installed in 
another server. So in the WCF web service as a part of the solution I have CI.

 1. Prior to adding CI, how were you talking to Riak?
I wasn't communicating with Riak before adding CI.

 1. Have you ran basho\_bench against your application before and after 
implementing CI? Can you please share your results?
Nope. I haven't run basho\_bench ever.
Thanks.
OJ

Hi Everyone,
 I am using Corrugated Iron(CI) for Riak in my WCF 
REST application. After adding CI, the web services started to send response 
very slow. All immediate consecutive request to the REST end points get queued 
up and the responses are delayed more. If anyone has implemented CI in the WCF 
project. Please advise me how to fix this issue.
