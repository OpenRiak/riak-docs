So I am trying to figure out how to do a map reduce on a bucket type with the 
erlang client in erl. I didnâ€™t see in the documentation how to do a map reduce 
with a bucket type. I have the bucket type and the bucket. I want to map reduce 
to basically filter out any documents whose createTime(which is just 
int/number) is less then 24 hours and return those. I have only been using riak 
for a few weeks and erlang for about a day. Any pointers or help would be 
appreciated.

Thanks
