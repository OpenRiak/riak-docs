Hey,

There's a new Berlin Riak user group and the first meet-up is on the 25th
of September:

 http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Riak/events/138533332/

Wooga and eBay will be giving talks about how they're using Riak and the
lessons they've learned along the way.

Wooga are kindly hosting and will be supplying drinks. The pizza will be on
Basho :)

Come say hi.
