Hi List,

I'm new to riak, and I am thinking of using riak to store log file / statistics 
information from a client application. The main benefit riak could offer here 
are its map-reduce/search capabilities.

The client side applications are developed in a variety of languages, but in 
the end all requests will be tunneled via a light weight API to our own Erlang 
"admin" application.

I've noticed that the riak Erlang API really dispatches requests to the riak 
cluster via the gen\_tcp module. The logging (insert) rate could be very high, 
so what would be neat is if I could embed our Erlang "admin" application 
directly into the riak cluster to avoid the IPC hop between the 
riak-erlang-client node and the riak node(s).

Now obviously I can fork the code and implement my own way of doing this, but 
the question is there an official way to embed your own code directly into a 
riak cluster to avoid that extra IPC hop?

Thanks

Matt
