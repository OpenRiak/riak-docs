Hi Chad, 

We decided to focus our development on Riak Control moving forward on 
administration features, specifically understanding how your cluster is 
performing, managing node addition and removal and visualizing distribution of 
data throughout the ring.

However, I'd be very interested in hearing which features of Futon you find 
most useful and what you're looking for in a UI for Riak.

Thanks!

- Chris
