I'm using Riak installed from riak\_0.14.0-1\_amd64.deb but am having a
problem with an Erlang reduce function I wrote because it used
calendar:iso\_week\_number/1 which isn't available in R13B04 which is bundled
with the .deb package. Is there an easy way to configure Riak to use a
different Erlang install (say installed at /usr/local/lib/erlang)?
