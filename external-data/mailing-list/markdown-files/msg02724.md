Riak Recap for March 21 - 22

1) @coda just posted the slides he and @rckenned used for their "Riak
at Yammer" presentation last night at the Riak Meetup.

\* Check them out here ---> https://twitter.com/coda/status/50664885863985152

The talk was filmed, too, and will be online by mid next week at the latest.

2) Q --- Any recommendations for uuid generation?

 A --- Your best bet is probably to use a separate uuid library and
generate it client side.

3) ngirn, chids, aphyr and roidrage had a brief chat about some
cluster testing basics.

4) roidrage and pferdefleisch had a short conversation about using
Riak for a Rails 3 project.

5) Q --- Would Riak handle an individual vnode failure the same way as
an entire node failure? (from grourk via #riak)

 A --- Yes. The request to that vnode would fail and will be routed
to the next available vnode.

6) Last but not least, the conference portion of Erlang Factory kicks
off tomorrow, and in addition to there being at least four talks that
will touch on Riak in a non-trivial way, a large majority of the Basho
crew will be there. Make some noise if you'll be in attendance.
