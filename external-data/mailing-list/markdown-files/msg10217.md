Hi Kevin,

Always good practise to reply to the mailing list so others can benefit
from the content

basho bench is the best place to start, If you have a working cluster or
even a working single node, follow the benchmarking guide[0]

Please let me see some of the specific errors you're having and we can help
resolve them.

Outside of basho bench, I recommend benchmarking the raw performance of
your VM, you can do this using a variety of tools like iostat, iperf or a
test suite like Phoronix test suite, a very comprehensive FOSS tool[1] look
at the `aio` test

I'd also recommend benchmarking each time you make a configuration change
to really understand how effective that change was
