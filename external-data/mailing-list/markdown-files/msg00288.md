Hello,

That error message is due to running out of filehandles. I am
guessing that you have a large number of empty files in your bitcask
data directories. If so, there are two pieces of information you may
find useful:

1 - it is safe to delete the empty files

2 - This will be addressed very soon, before bitcask is considered an
officially-supported backend.
