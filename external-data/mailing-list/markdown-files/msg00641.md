Hi Tamas,

You can find the public bug tracker here:
https://issues.basho.com/

Regarding using Bitcask with multiple backends, the only issue I've seen is
trying to setup multiple bitcask backends. Bitcask defines options using the
"bitcask" application specification which is globally set for the node; this
prevents multiple instances of the bitcask backend from running on a single
node:
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=210

You should be able to run a bitcask backend along side other backend types
such as dets.

I did not completely follow your description; what issues did you see after
setting bitcask as a backend in the multibackend options? Were keys not
stored? Did you see errors in the log files? Did you try to setup multiple
bitcask backends?

Thanks,
Dan
