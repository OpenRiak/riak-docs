 Yes, this is a 32-bit system.  So far I still get those errors even
 with the change to ~/.bashrc
 I notice that my default LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH is completely empty,
 though.

 They might indeed be on your system, but are simply
 not in your LD path so the linker doesn't know where to look for
 them.   One thing that is curious though, those last links are the
 32bit libstdc++ libraries, are you on a 32bit system?   If not,
 you might not have the 64bit c++ libraries installed.   In my
 case, I have the libraries you have, as well as:
 


/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.16




If you do indeed want to link to the 32bit versions, make
 sure the linker is looking for that path.


env | grep LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH


If
 it is not, just add it in your start up scripts (defaulted
 to ~/.bashrc for ubuntu/mint)


export
 LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH:your\_additional\_path




Hope that helps,
Jared
