Carson,

Unfortunately the PB interface, as you discovered, doesn't support all the 
bucket properties. You could, however, also use the riak-erlang-http-client 
which has full support for all bucket properties. We realize this is a pain 
point and will be working to improve the PB interface in the near future. To 
enable the precommit hook, do something like this with the HTTP client:

Client = rhc:create(), %% use create/4 if you're not connecting to localhost
rhc:set\_bucket(Client, "my\_bucket", [{<<"precommit">>, [
 {struct, [{<<"mod">>, <<"riak\_search\_kv\_hook">>}, {<<"fun">>, 
<<"precommit">>}]}
 ]}]).
