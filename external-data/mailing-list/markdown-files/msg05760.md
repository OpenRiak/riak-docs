That's indeed a very clean solution! Thanks a lot for pointing it out to me!

How should we set up a development environment so that Riak and all other
Erlang applications works, and lets us build our different stuff (storage
backend, vnodes, web app) on top of it? What's a good way of having good
versatility when developing? Do we always have to go through rebuilding a
brand new package after each modification?


Hi, Mathieu. I think a good place to start might be reading another
recent thread on this list about "Integrating Riak":
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2011-November/006615.html

Specifically, Sean Cribb's suggestion near the end of the thread,
about using -pz and -s options in Riak's vm.args configuration, will
likely give you the best flexibility in developing so closely to Riak.
