"The io\_mode setting specifies which code module Bitcask should use for
file access. The available settings are:

erlang (default) — Writes are made via Erlang's built-in file API
nif — Writes are made via direct calls to the POSIX C API"

These sentences mention 'writes' only, does it affect other file IO (reads,
stats)?
