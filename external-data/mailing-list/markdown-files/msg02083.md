I would think that either MySQL or PostgreSQL would work well with any
application. PostgreSQL's commercial support is cheaper than MySQL's, plus
PostgreSQL 9.1 will include support for
SQL/MED
allowing
you to register tables other databases as linked tables (provided someone
has written a driver).

The downside to PostgreSQL is that it's somewhat convoluted. There are a lot
of bells and whistles to use for tuning it, but that just means that you can
tune PostgreSQL for your exact workload. I'm not familiar enough with MySQL
to say one way or the other about bells and whistles for tuning.

You could test to see how well the key filtering aspects of Riak help you
out. You only need to add the map phase and, as it's in memory, it's pretty
quick.

It might be worth making a list of all of the queries for your application
and determining how to model your data to answer those questions.
