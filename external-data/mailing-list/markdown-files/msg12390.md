Matthew, thanks very much for your feedback. I may bite the bullet and try your 
suggested "last resort method" on one of the nodes. I'll let you know how that 
goes. All nodes are 1.3 or newer.

As to your question: my key is a bit of both and is quite long for typical Riak 
usage I guess. The first part is a sort of device-ID indicating where the data 
came from (typical Riak-generated random key generated when a new device is 
added to the system), there are around 500 devices in the system now. The 
second part is typical timestamp in yyyymmdd notation. As an example: 
qvKKWKrCHLzRTYZBnDNkL6aaRFU20120619098357011462. This allows for selection of a 
certain date range for a single device using 2i on $key which actually works 
very well and has decent performance (the same timestamp is also stored as an 
\_int index to select across devices).

Regards,
Timo
