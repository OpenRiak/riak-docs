Hi Shrikar,

I suspect you've gotten to the bottom of this (as we haven't heard
from you in a few days), but upon re-reading this I noticed the
following:

>

The following nodes are unreachable: ['riak@192.168.8.134',
 'riak@192.168.8.135']

electic@riak-6:/var/lib/riak/leveldb$ ping 92.168.8.134
PING 92.168.8.134 (92.168.8.134) 56(84) bytes of data.
^C

It looks like you're trying to ping "92.168.8.134", which is different
from the "192.168.8.134" address above.

That may not solve the issue, but it might not be a bad place to start.

Hope that helps. Let us know if you're still chasing this.

Mark
