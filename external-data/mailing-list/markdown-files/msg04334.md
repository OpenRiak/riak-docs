Sorry, that was after the last act of a desperate man :-)
 
Installing the package in this environment at least, required a
'buildbot' user and that was who owned the dirs after install.
A riak user was created but didn't have access.

Reinstalling from the package, then chown-ing /opt/riak to riak:staff,
followed by chmod-ing /opt/riak to 755 and start/ping/PUT/etc all now
work!


Thanks!

Robert
