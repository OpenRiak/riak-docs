Hey!

The London Riak meet-up is tomorrow evening:

 http://www.meetup.com/riak-london/events/115140912/

We've got Charlie von Metzradt of Hosted Graphite talking about their
production Riak use. There'll also be refreshments.

It kicks off at 6.30pm.

Come along: it's in Holborn, so pretty easy to get to.
