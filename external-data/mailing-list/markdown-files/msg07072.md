In Riak 1.1.x, four or more physical nodes and a stock n\_val of 3 will
almost guarantee (\*very\* close to 100% of the time) you have physical
copies on distinct physical nodes. We will be able to guarantee this
absolutely in the future (though I can't give a precise timeline on when
that work will be completed).
