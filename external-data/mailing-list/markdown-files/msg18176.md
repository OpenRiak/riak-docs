Hello All,

I was wondering how can I bootstrap a master-less Riak KV cluster in an 
automated way where nodes get re-created on failures and form a healthy 
cluster. In my scenario I am using Riak for ephemeral data so losing data is 
acceptable as long as cluster is available and self healing across partitions 
and node reboots.

Thanks for your help!
