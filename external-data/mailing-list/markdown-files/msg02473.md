Just out of curiosity I did some tests myself on one of our production
machines. We normally only use the ProtocolBuffers interface and a
thrift interface that we wrote ourselves.

If I fetch a small key (~250 bytes), the riak server becomes CPU bound
with about 20 concurrent requests, at which point the latency naturally
becomes larger. At this point one riak server is handling over 6000
requests/s. This is on an 8 core system (Dual Intel Xeon E5506
@2.13GHz), and all cores are at nearly 100%. No tuning was done on
either riak or the OS.

Also 99% of the requests still took less then 20ms, while with 10
concurrent requests its more like 2ms.
