So, I announced lager 2.0.0rc1 during my Erlang factory talk
( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BNpOHFvg\_Q ), but forgot to announce
it to the relevant mailing lists. So I'm announcing RC2 here.


Congratulations!


\* New tracing engine, based on goldrush (thanks DeadZen)


Glad to see this being made useful. The initial goldrush work was made 
by someone that I'm sure we all miss.
