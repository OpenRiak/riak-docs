If you are not adverse to building from source, you might like the leveldb 
updates slated for 1.4 Riak. There is an emphasis on write throughput. The 
best branch for trial would be mv-level-work2 in github's basho/leveldb 
repository. I suspect you will find about 50% improvement in data ingest over 
periods of 2 hours or more.
