Hi,

For an experiment I need to run riak (around 100 instances) with very high
number of partitions. But when I have 512 partitions even with 10 or 20
instances, there are lot or timeouts with reads and writes and tale a long
time to start a node. Can you please tell me why this happens?

Thank you very much!
