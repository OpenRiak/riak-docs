Riak Recap for June 24 - 26
====================


1) Thomas Schank released something he is calling riakqp, "a utility
to prototype riak MapReduce queries efficiently in CoffeScript
syntax."

\* Code and link to a blog post with more details here --->
https://github.com/DrTom/riakqp

Thanks, Thomas!

2) We merged a piece of code into riak\_kv from Anthony Molinaro that
enables you to return key counts for different bitcask backends.

\* Details here --->
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/commit/eb664ae3af2139ec1ee100d9b0c491867493b75c

Thanks, Anthony!

3) Q --- Is it possible to get all keys of a certain name irrespective
of their bucket? (from pudo via #riak)

 A --- This isn't currently possible in Riak.

4) Q --- How do you pronounce "riak"? (from DemonCat via #riak)

 A --- REE-awk (or ->
