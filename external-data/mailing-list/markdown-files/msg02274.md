Hey All,

Anyone have a few minutes to review a few Erlang functions that came
into Riak Function Contrib yesterday? Here's the pull request:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_function\_contrib/pull/7

Specifically, the function code that needs reviewing is

https://github.com/basho/riak\_function\_contrib/pull/7/files#diff-3

and

https://github.com/basho/riak\_function\_contrib/pull/7/files#diff-4

Any help would be appreciated. Please keep the comments on the actual
pull request if possible.

Thanks (and thanks again to Ryan for putting this code and
documentation together for function contrib),

Mark
