Just wanted to say thanks again to everyone for the insight here. I fully agree 
with the “security mindset” (hence my starting this chain) and am aware of the 
need to prevent external access to Riak nodes (I’ll probably just use iptables 
to prevent access from everywhere except known application machines and use 
them as bastion host for SSH/admin).

This is the core of what I was asking, really. I’ve seen problems in various 
SQL libraries/ORMs (ActiveRecord for example) where specially crafted strings, 
even passed into the library/sanitizer, can still trigger injection. I just 
haven’t done anything using JSON for a data store before so I wanted to get a 
clear picture of how to do it \*right\* before I did it wrong :-)

Thanks again!
