Hi everyone,

Its was a great news to know about Riak's support for secondary indexes.
That was a great work indeed!

AFAIK, one will be able to index equality queries (property:value) and
range queries (property:[red TO rum]) as described in Riak website. But I
have some queries with inequality operators such as "<", ">", "<=", ">="
etc. For example, I need to search through a recods of users to find all
the users whose "age" is < 28 (I assume the record has "name", "age",
"address" properties stored using a username as the key).

1. Can I make use of secondary indexes for this kind of inequality queries
so that querying will be faster?
2. If not, what should be the best way to solve this kind of situations in
Riak?
3. Does 2i only work with LevelDB as backend storage?

Thanks in advance :-)
