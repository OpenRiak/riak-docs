Take registration for example, within 1 second, how could I find out the 
same user already registered in the database? Suppose the email address 
is the ID but is not the key. KEY is generated guid.


(I have been suggested to use the email address as the key. But it's a 
big change. I just want to make sure that there is really no other way)


Thanks,
