Howdy Philip,

This behavior varies from client to client. When a client doesn't support load 
balancing, many people have taken to using HAProxy or nginx to spread the load 
across an entire cluster. I believe OJ Reeves wrote an article long ago about 
this very subject. You can find it over at 
http://buffered.io/posts/webmachine-erlydtl-and-riak-part-2/

I found another one over here: 
http://blog.dloh.org/Riak,-haproxy,-and-client-side-applications

I hope this helps!
