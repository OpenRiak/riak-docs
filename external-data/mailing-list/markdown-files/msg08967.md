If I have a cluster of say, 4 nodes, is it possible to split that cluster into 
two clusters of 2 nodes, each with a full complement of the original cluster's 
data, while the data is continuously being served? Obviously, we would require 
that the data be small enough to fit on 2 nodes.

Thanks for your help,

Dave
