I wonder what happens if one would run a Riak cluster on 5/10/15+ EC2 micro (or 
small) Linux machines behind Elastic Load Balance? Do you think it would 
perform well enough for a web site with moderate traffic. Idea is having many 
many "small" machines rather than couple of "big" machines. 

Anyone has any experience with something similar?

Thanks,
Gibraltar
