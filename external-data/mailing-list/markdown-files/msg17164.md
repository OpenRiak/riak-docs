Hello All!


Here’s the latest summary of the Riak users mailing list, latest client
releases and job openings at Basho.

## Latest Releases


 -

 NodeJS Client 2.1.2 - includes improvements to closed connections
 handling such as with AWS ELB. Release notes [1] and code [2].
 -

 Java Client 2.0.5 - brings a number of fixes including a fix to a DNS
 refresh issue and enhanced testing. Release notes [3] and maven repo [4].


## Recently Answered


 -

 Magnus and Russell help Oleksiy clear up some confusion about the hidden
 $bucket index [5] - but only when using leveldb. Nevertheless, perhaps a
 $bucket query should not be accepted against a bitcask backend [6].
 -

 Robert notes that when joining nodes to clusters they must have the same
 ring sizes [7].
 -

 Agung is interested in working with riak\_ensemble [8][9] and has a few
 questions about it. Carlos recommends taking a look at nkbase [10], which
 uses riak\_ensemble, and Sargun goes into more detail [11].


## Open Discussions


 -

 Fred and Magnus are working with Oleksiy to determine the root cause of
 inconsistent Solr search results [12].
 -

 Bartek is looking for assistance on how to feed a mapreduce job with the
 results of a full text search [13]
 -

 Kinson is looking for guidance on implementing Basho Bench [14]
 -

 There is an open question regarding whether it’s possible to rebalance
 Riak KV without adding/removing nodes or making any hardware changes [15]
 -

 Luke thinks that Gerhard’s proposed architecture will ensure replicas
 are distributed to every node, but invites someone with more knowledge of
 the hashing method to chime in [16]
 -

 Robert is looking for guidance on choosing EC2 instance types for use
 with Riak/LevelDB [17]
 -

 Vitaly is helping troubleshoot timeouts in a deployment of Riak KV
 running on a cluster with 512 partitions [18]
 -

 There’s an open question about debugging a post commit hook for a bucket
 type in Riak 2.1.3 [19]
 -

 Christopher explained that when configuring multiple Riak clients in a
 cluster, you need to have each client use a different name. Chathuri has
 some follow-up questions about the configuration [20]
 -

 Vitaly and Chris are helping troubleshoot testing in a single node
 implementation of Riak KV [21]
