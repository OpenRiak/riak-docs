(sent to the list instead of just Dan this time, sorry Dan, gmail user fail)

I opened the original bug report on this, and it was resolved a day or two
ago. The committed patch sets COMMAND\_MODE=unix2003. I'm not sure if one
approach is better or more portable than the other, just letting you know
what's up.

Original bug is here: https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=63
commit is here: http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/changeset/c27fc73ef47d
