Hi Toby.

It's possible, since they're stored separately, that the objects were
deleted but the indices were left in place because of some error (e.g.
the operation failed for some reason between the object removal and
the index removal). One of the things on the feature list for the
next release is AAE of index values, which should take care of this
case. This is really rare, but not unknown. It'd be interesting to
know how you ended up with so many.

In the mean time, the only way I can think of to get rid of them
(other than deleting them from the console, which would require taking
nodes down and a lot of manual effort), would be to write another
value that would have the same index, then delete it, which should
normally succeed.

I'll ask around to see if there is anything that might work better.
