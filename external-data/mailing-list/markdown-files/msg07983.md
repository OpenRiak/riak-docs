Hi,

Say I have a 'users' bucket that stores user data (name, email) and I also
have secondary index to access users by e-mail, how do I update the index
in case a user's e-mail address changes?

The only approach I found so far was to completely delete the user object,
which implies a deletion of the index entry, and then recreate the update
object and add the new e-mail to the index. Is this the only way?

Thanks,
Kaspar
