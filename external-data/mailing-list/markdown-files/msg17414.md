Hi

I am quite new to RIAK-\*. I have setup riak cs on a single server (for
evaluation purposes) with adequate RAM, CPU and high performance storage. I
am using Cosbench to benchmark RIAK-CS using the S3 proxy connection.
Cosbench is also running on the same server (the reasons being I wanted to
eliminate the effect of network on performance).

I have tried different workloads (100% reads, 80:20 read write mix, number
of objects (20-20000), size of objects (4K-64K)). My observation has been
that I have not managed to push the throughput to beyond 2.5Kops - the best
case being 100% reads and about 128 objects and 128 cosbench worker threads.
With 20% writes the number comes down to less than 1000.

The CPU is largely idle, plenty of RAM left (order of GB). Storage is
capable of 300K+ IOPS but hardly utilised.

Coming to my question: does this represent the limit of performance of a
\*single\* riak-cs node. I notice that the average response time is in the
order of 60ms.

Lastly, has anyone compared S3 with RIAK-CS?

Thanks,
-M
