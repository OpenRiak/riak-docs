Right - if you want read your own writes consistency you need to make Riak
behave consistently and (assuming \*n\* = 3) specify \*dw\* at least 2
(preferably 3) for writes and \*r\* at least 2 for reads. This, of course,
means that you're going to lose.

In reality, this can be mitigated by putting a cache in front of Riak. A
number of people on the list advocate using Redis since it offers
relatively rich querying functionality that most caches lack. A combination
of Redis + Riak will, most likely, meet most querying needs but it does add
some operational and development complexity.

Without knowing more about Yassen's requirements, it's difficult to say
which aspects of Riak meet the app's needs and which ones might require
some mitigation wrt operational shenanigans like caching.
