I am a moron!

Edit deps/erlang/rebar.config. Change "make" in the last two lines to
"gmake".

From:

{port\_pre\_script, {"make -C c\_src", ""}}.
{port\_cleanup\_script, "make -C c\_src clean"}.

to

{port\_pre\_script, {"gmake -C c\_src", ""}}.
{port\_cleanup\_script, "gmake -C c\_src clean"}.

Looking for a proper fix for this for the time being that doesn't involve
autoconf.
