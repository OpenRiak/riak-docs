Do you have this in your app.config?

{riak\_search, [
 {enabled, true}
 ]},


Did you enable the bucket that you want to search for indexing? Off the top
of my head it is something like

http://127.0.0.1:8098:/riak/bucket?search=true

note to basho: i could not find the relevant instructions on the wiki nor
the knowledgebase. and i clicked around a bunch.
