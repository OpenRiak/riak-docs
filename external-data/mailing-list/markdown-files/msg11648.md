Matthew,

I did some testing with your code and I was able to reproduce what you were
seeing. I would occasionally see an error similar to the following:

 Failed to fetch item 460 err Object not found

This behavior is a result of the trade-offs of using an eventually
consistent database like Riak. It is not the case that your inserts are
failing to write or the data is being lost, but what is actually happening
is that the quick read after writing with the default request options does
not provide any guarantee that you will read your writes. So basically when
you make the read, the replicas that are responding to your request have
not seen the latest value yet and so you end up with "Not Found" as the
response. If you did another read attempt for one of those objects reported
missing, it would succeed because Riak's read-repair would have kicked in
to make sure each replica has the value. To increase the likelihood of
reading your writes you should set the optional request parameters pr and
pw to ensure that all of the primary replicas are available prior to
performing a read or write request. I altered your code to use those
options and put the updates in a gist [1] (it's my first stab at Go so my
changes may not be very idiomatic). Additionally I changed to riak driver
so that NotFoundOk was false instead of true. With these changes I was able
to run the test 50 times in a row with no errors where previously I would
see at least one error every 10 iterations or so. Hope that helps.
