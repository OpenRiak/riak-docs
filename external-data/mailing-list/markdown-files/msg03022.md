Hi list,

I'm wondering how riaksearch performance will degrade as I add documents.

For my purpose I limit rows at 1k and sorting is not necessary. I have a
single node cluster for development. I know I can increase performance if I
add nodes but I'd like to understand this before I do.

My documents are small ~200 bytes. With an index of 30k and rows limited to
1k, no problems. I added 100k documents, and then I hit
the too\_many\_results error. Since I still have my row limit set at 1k, this
indicates that the query does not return as soon as it finds the first 1k
hits. Is there a way to short circuit my queries so that they don't have to
scan the whole index?

I got around too\_many\_results by increasing my max\_search\_results (I read
https://help.basho.com/entries/480664-i-get-the-error-too-many-results). I
wonder, though, if I'll keep bumping memory boundaries as I add a few
million docs to my index.

Thanks,
Daniel
