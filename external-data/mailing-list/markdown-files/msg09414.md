Hi all,

As part of load test (of my application, not Riak), I'm making successive 
fetch/GET requests in a rapid fire fashion. I once got 204 status code 
(successful but no content response). I do know that there exist an object for 
that key since previous 105 calls did return the body, but how come I did not 
get it at 106th time? There's no conditional request or anything and each call 
is identical. So far it happened once, but should I take this into account or 
ignore it? 

I only care if an object exists, I would like to fetch it, modify it and put it 
back. But when I get statusCode 204 does that mean that I need to repeat the 
fetch call until I get statusCode 200 and the body? Does one need to work 
around this nature of Riak at each point of contact? 

I am looking for a specific answer for 204 condition as well as some insight 
about using a database like Riak and how one needs to treat it compared to 
RDBMS. My previous experience with RDBMS is one of deterministic, and I think 
there's nothing wrong with Riak, but seems like these two tools need to treated 
differently. What do you say?

I'm using riak-js for the client. There's one riak node on my laptop, and using 
LevelDB.

Thanks,
Gibraltar
