I suspect that, given the large heap messages, you're seeing the known
issues where when a custom bucket is created and the moving that
metadata around the ring takes increasingly long. It isn't
recommended to create a large number of custom buckets at the moment.

What the process likely looks like is this:

1. you do the set.
2. bucket metadata starts being gossip around the ring.
3. you do the put. it succeeds, but on some nodes, the metadata
hasn't been committed, so it's put into the default backend.
4. gossip finishes.
5. you do the get. it fails because now the bucket for this backend
has made 2 replicas unreachable.
6. read repair happens, repopulating the 2 missing replicas.
7. you re-get and it works.
