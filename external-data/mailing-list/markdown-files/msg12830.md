Hi,

I've been having a lot of problems with the Riak Python Client when using
protocol buffers. The problem seems to be related to some kind of socket
timeout because it only happens if a particular instance of a riak client
object has not been used for more than 60 seconds. I describe the problem
in more detail in this StackOverflow question:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19742667/timeout-problems-with-the-riak-python-client-with-protocol-buffers

Any ideas? Am i using the client object in the wrong way?

Best regards,
Finkle
