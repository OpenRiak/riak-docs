Each key-column value actually already is a rollup of a sparse matrix
(which is why the uncompressed key-column values are always exactly the
same length when they exist)
Having just watched that great talk (thanks) it's extremely similar to how
the guys at Boundary are rolling up their data. Validates the approach
which is awesome!

Having just learned from that same talk that when using LevelDB keys don't
have to remain in mem, I'm just going with the logical 
as my new aggregated keys, each having a rolledup sparse matrix as a value.
Hope that made any sense.

Anyway, this feels great!
