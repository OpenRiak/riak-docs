Hi,

I was writing some unit tests and got a surprise when the http api did not 
respond with the expected 400 status code when I set the n\_val bucket property 
to a negative number. When I fetched the bucket property, Riak cheerfully told 
me the value was indeed negative.

Are negative numbers valid for n\_val? Is there documented behavior for such a 
situation? How will a cluster behave in such a case?

My test server runs 1.3.0 with leveldb as the backend.
