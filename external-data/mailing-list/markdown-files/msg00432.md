Afternoon, Evening, Morning -

A quick recap for today - a question from #riak and a few reminders.

1) Q --- what's a vtag? just a unique hash? (from scootsm via #riak)

 A --- vtag is a hash. In the case where there are no siblings,
it's a hash of the vclock.

2) Yesterday @timanglade launched "A NoSQL Summer" which is billed as
"a network of local reading groups, that will decipher & discuss
NOSQL-related articles." It's intended to be a weekly gathering to
breakdown the technical papers and details behind a lot of NoSQL
Databases. So, if you are looking for an in depth discussion on the
theory and research underpinning a lot of these new-fangled NoSQL DBs,
you should check this out.

3) Reminder: For anyone signed up or thinking about going to Gluecon
tomorrow and Wednesday, there are some great Basho related things
happening :

a) Basho Board Member Eric Brewer, creator of the CAP theorem, will be
keynoting. This should be awesome!
b) Riak Dev. Jon Meredith will be giving a Technical Talk on Riak. I
got a run through of the talk this morning and it's top notch.
