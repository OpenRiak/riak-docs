Matthew,

At least one or more of your nodes must have started before you changed
that setting. Debian pretty often will start a service immediately after
its package is installed, which can be annoying. Assuming you didn't put
any data in it yet, the solution is to take all of the nodes down, remove
all files from /var/lib/riak/ring on all nodes, and then restart and rejoin
the cluster.
