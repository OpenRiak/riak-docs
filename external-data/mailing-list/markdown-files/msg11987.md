Hi,

Putting varnish in front of Riak CS nodes seems a good idea, if the
load concentrates on small number of videos whose total size fits in
varnish's memory. Yet I'm not sure how varnish works in caching.
Putting varnish between Riak CS and Riak is not a good idea because
they communicates with protocol buffers, not HTTP.
