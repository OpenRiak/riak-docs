New keys, new data, straight in for the first time, no fetch before store? I've 
had reasonable results creating a \*number\* of threads and using the Java Raw PB 
client to write. 

For example, maybe have a 1 or a couple of threads that reads data (from 
Oracle, a file, what-have-you) and puts it on a queue, and have a bunch of 
threads that pull data off the queue, create a riak object and store it. From 
my laptop I've got up to 2500 writes a second like this, and it was just ad 
hoc, throw away code with 4 threads against a small 3 node cluster (running on 
desktops.)

I imagine others on the list have more direct, real world examples?
