Hi

Help. I want to store few thousands of small png (each of them will just be
10K) into riak.
But I find that is really slow (1 to 2 second for one png).

Currently, I use a bash script to find and loop the directory
And curl PUT the png onto riak.

Do we have a bulk upload or will it be faster if I use erlang or or driver?
I need to upload 1000 small png within one minute. Can it be done?

Currently, I am on riak 1.01 and levelDB backend.

Thanks a lot!
