(Apologies if this is a recurring topic, but I haven’t read a clear statement 
yet in relation to this)

Using Riak, I sometimes feel that link walking might be a corner stone for 
certain data modelling techniques. The Riak documentation though states clearly 
that this is not feasible while also enabling security (another cornerstone for 
certain business cases): http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/authz/

I was wondering if there’s any plans to retire link walking and replaces it 
with something else (that \*is\* compatible with the security design) or if there 
are alternatives that could help fill this gap.

Thanks in advance
Cos
