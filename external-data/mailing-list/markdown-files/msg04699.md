Riak 1.0 is coming soon.
Now would be a good time to overhaul the PHP client.

Goals

 - Add support for Protocol Buffers
 - Add support for new Riak 1.0 features (2i, pr, pw, client\_id, etc)
 - Add performance benchmarks
 - Improve network performance
 - Improve tests
 - Add support for streaming results
 - Add automatic read-before-write
 - Add support for retries and sibling resolution
 - Discourage expensive operations by throwing warnings

I also think it's time the client required PHP 5.3+

 - Namespacing for better class organization
 - Late static binding for looser coupling and greater extensibility
 - Anonymous functions for inline retries and sibling resolution

Is there anyone using PHP 5.2 in production with Riak that hasn't upgraded
to PHP 5.3?
