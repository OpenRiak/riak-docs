Ripple supports "single-bucket inheritance". All stored documents contain a 
"\_type" field in the stored JSON object. However, 'find' calls are not scoped 
to specific types (no indices!), so you must be aware that the type 
instantiated might not be the same as the requested type. 

PDI: A check could be added to 'instantiate' to verify that the selected class 
is a descendant of the requested class.
