Riak Recap for 8/30 - 8/31

1) More on Bitcask compaction from #riak.

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/561201

2) A recording of @robertobrien's Riak talk from the recent "Auckland
Bar Camp" has surfaced. The audio is a somewhat sub-optimal but the
content is top notch.

Thanks, Robert!

3) pjstadig kicked off a short convo by asking, "Is there any

 both adding to and removing from said set?"

peschkaj via #riak)
