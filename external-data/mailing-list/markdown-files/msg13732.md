Very cool indeed,

unfortunately, I believe the parent/child relationship is an insert time
functionality, which wouldn't be compatible with the way riak keys get
indexed, maybe someone from @basho can chime in on if its possible to use
this feature, it might require a separate extractor in yokozuna.
