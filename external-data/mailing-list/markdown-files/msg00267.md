Riak nodes belonging to the same cluster do use distributed Erlang to 
communicate. We have no plans to encrypt this data as it would likely impact 
overall performance. If you really need to encrypt cluster traffic then a VPN 
would be appropriate. Could you describe your use case for encrypting cluster 
traffic?

We do not have any immediate plans to add security or authorization. Deploying 
reverse proxies for security is a very common pattern.
