Hi, I'm new to Riak and I'm using the TS version to perform some tests in
my Java application, running on an Ubuntu 16.04 server, for a college
project.
The library I'm using is riak-client-2.1.1, with all of its dependencies.
But, when I try to connect to the DB to save data, the connection doesn't
happen, and after a few minutes, the java proccess is closed.
What could it be? Maybe a problem with the DB settings?
