The results from one phase get passed on to the next phase, so if you want
both data sets you need to run two different map-reduce queries. If you
want the results from the link phase you need to run a link phase in
addition to a map phase (link first and then you can do the map phase with
Riak.mapValuesJson, which will give you the object that the link is pointing
to).
