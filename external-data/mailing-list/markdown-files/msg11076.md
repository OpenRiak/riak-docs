Kurt,

I'm not sure about the cause of the MapReduce crash (I suspect it's running
out of resources of some kind, even with the increase of vm count and mem).
One word of advice about the list keys timeout, though:
Be sure to use streaming list keys.

In Python, this would look something like:

for keylist in bucket.stream\_keys():
 for key in keylist:
 # Do something with the key


This will at least avoid the timeout problem (though you may want to
consider your use case here, and maybe use secondary index queries or
search queries instead of listing all the keys in a bucket, since even a
streaming list keys has to iterate over \_all\_ keys in a cluster).
