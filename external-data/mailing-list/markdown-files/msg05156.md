I made progress, thanks to Russell who answered my email the other day.

I've got a simple javascript precommit hook installed and it seems to
work fine, most of the time. However, it will randomly timeout. There
aren't any interesting messages in any of the logs. I am able to store
a key/value pair one minute, but then not be able to store the same pair
in the next minute.

Where should I be looking to get more info? Are there any "safe"
operations, or operations that are discouraged in precommit hooks?

Thanks,
Hal
