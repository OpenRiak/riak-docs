Riak Recap for 8/12

1) @b6n updated the Riak Cookbook to the 0.12 release and Chef 0.9. As
of last night, he was looking for help testing, so lend him hand here
if you have a moment.

Github repo here ---> http://bit.ly/dvsHxt

2) I forgot to mention we added a page to the Riak Wiki with a whole
mess of slide presentations.

Check it out here ---> http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Slides

3) For all you on the west coast: last chance to register for
tomorrow's Devnation conference in San Francisco being held at Engine
Yard

Details here ---> http://devnation.us/events/9

4) Q --- How can I get all buckets on a node though REST ? (from garry
via #riak)

 A --- There currently is no way to do this but we have an open
ticket for it. You can track it here --->
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=78

5) jdmaturen, moonpolysoft, benblack, and roidrage had a worthwhile
discussion in #riak that started with "is there a good way to do lists
or sets [of integer ids] in riak?"

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/523500

6) Q --- On https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Links where it
mentions doubly linked lists â€¦ is that there for the case where access
can be serialized? or is the example just a bad one for dynamo-land?

 A --- You can't serialize access to any object in riak. The
example from the wiki is just an example of using links to make a list
of objects.
