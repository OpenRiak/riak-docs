Hi Jon,

Thanks for getting back to me.

I'm doing full-text indexing, but I don't need to keep the text around once my 
object has been indexed, so I wrote a second precommit hook to remove the text 
from the object. This reduces the size of my objects drastically (since text 
tends to be the largest part) and has given us substantial perf gains in our 
tests.
