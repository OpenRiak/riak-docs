Alexander,

Great post, lots of information, thanks for sharing this.

On key size, I agree it is important to understand that Riak will not
retrieve partial keys. I think I read in the list that they may
eventually allow partial retrieval of only header information on keys.
I think this would be an excellent improvement.

My time capsule buckets idea was not to add links at the bucket level,
but to create time capsule objects into different buckets, for example
a "day" bucket which would contain time capsule objects for every
second. So a day bucket would contain 86400 time capsule objects which
would either have links pointing to all realtime data objects that
were gathered within that second OR contain the list of keys to these
realtime data objects.

I am thinking per day buckets and per second time capsule objects
because this looks like a reasonable way to partition the data without
creating too many buckets and not too many objects within bucket if
listing keys is required to launch a mapreduce job over the complete
bucket. Hourly buckets also sound good.

I like your external index + Redis idea and to <>. The question is, how do we efficiently
integrate this with the m/r framework? Will retrieving the list of
keys in the application, by reading a bunch of these "index" keys (or
similarly my "time capsule" keys) and passing them as the input list
of a m/r job be efficient? What if we are dealing with very large key
list, think hundred of thousands or millions?

[... lunch ...] (hey, I'm on the east cost!)

Ah! yes, of course. Sorry, I'm answering my own question here, but I
just realized that having index buckets with objects that contains a
key list pointing to the realtime data objects would absolutely work
with a multi phase mapreduce where the first phase would select the
initial set of keys by doing a key list on a whole bucket or by using
the link query, then an initial map phase would simply read all the
keys from the "index" or "time capsule" objects and pass it as a key
list to a subsequent map phase which would actually work on the data.
This initial map phase would be a dereferencing phase. Make sense?

Riak+Redis for this really has legs. I will definitely look into this.

As for your ElasticSearch suggestions, this is exactly what I had in
mind. My current state of reflexion with it is: can I distribute the
indexing of my realtime data using mapreduce jobs (and scale
horizontally with it)? I think so. As you noted, everything seems to
be there including an HTTP interface.

Thanks again for your insights.
Colin
