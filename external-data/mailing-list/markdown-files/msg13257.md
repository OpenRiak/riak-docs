This Friday will be our last Riak Community Hangout for 2013 (and last until 
the 2nd Friday in January due to the holidays), and we’re looking for topics 
that you’d like to hear us discuss.

Please drop me an email if you have something in particular you think would 
make for a good conversation. (We have a long list of our own, so your idea 
might be thrown into that and pop up next year.)

For anyone who hasn’t yet watched, our previous hangouts are available from our 
YouTube page: http://www.youtube.com/user/BashoTechnologies. We’ve covered the 
key new features arriving with Riak 2.0, and last week we talked a bit about 
client libraries.

(Please disregard the lingering scheduled redundant hangout for last Friday; 
Google+ is such a Frankenstein’s monster of ill-fitting parts that I haven’t 
figured out how to purge it.)

On a personal note, thanks to everyone in the community for a great 2013.
