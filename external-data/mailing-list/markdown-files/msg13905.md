Does that happen immediately? I am basically trying to understand: When a 
physical node goes down (let's say it is temporarily restarted, or down for 
even a couple hours due to some sort of failure), will that cause an increase 
in disk and network bandwidth at the moment that it goes down as data is 
re-shuffled across the cluster?

Thanks,
Jeff
