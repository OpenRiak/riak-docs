Greetings All,

I have a use case for our app where I need to fetch a list of keys that match 
some pattern and was hoping to be able to use key filters for that.

In my test I defined a key filter for the input phase of mapred and then 
defined just a single map phase that returns the object key. But there is 
considerable overhead with that map phase because (I'm assuming this part) Riak 
is having to load each object to provide the necessary inputs to the map 
function.

Is there a way to do this without Riak having to actually load the objects?

Many thanks,
