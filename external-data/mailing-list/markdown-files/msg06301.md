We are using it on amazon with no issues. we are using 7.5gb instances. You can 
reduce the cost by doing reserve instances.

We are still using bitcask, which makes amount of ram per instance very 
important due to each node need to keep all keys it's responsible for in the 
ram.

It's a trade off, is raw metal nice? Sure. However, ec2 gives you advantage 
compare to your own co-lo datacenter.
