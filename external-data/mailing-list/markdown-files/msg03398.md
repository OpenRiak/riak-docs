Just curious if anyone has any ideas, for the moment, I'm just taking
the RAM calculation and multiplying by 2 and the Disk calculation and
multiplying by 8, based on my findings with my current cluster. But
I would like to know why my values are so much higher than those I should
be getting.

Also, I'd still like to know how the forms calculate things as the disk
calculation there does not match reality or the formula.

Also, waiting to hear if there is any way to force merge to run so I can
more accurately gauge whether multiple copies are effecting disk usage.

Thanks,

-Anthony
