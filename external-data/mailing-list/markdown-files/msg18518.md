Hola! 

I’ve built packages for the following distributions: 

- Ubuntu xenial 
- Ubuntu artful 
- Ubuntu trusty
- RHEL 7 / Centos 7
- RHEL 6 / Centos 6

The packages can be downloaded from the following package cloud repository: 

https://packagecloud.io/erlang-solutions/riak\_release\_candidates 


The instructions for using the package cloud repository are on the linked page, 
just follow the link.

Notes: 

- I haven’t built packages for Ubuntu zesty as that product has recently been 
retired.

- I haven’t built for Ubuntu bionic as we don’t yet have a build of basho 
r16b02\_basho10 for this (new) distribution.

- I’ll take a look at Alpine Linux packaging later this week.

If you experience any problems, please get in contact over Slack and I’ll 
investigate.
