Hi,
I'm new to the Riak. I know the default value of n\_val is 2, but is it
possible to start with one node, no replication initially and then start
adding the nodes and increase the replication factor.

What happens if I run only a single node without changing the default
values? Does it cause any errors as there is no other nodes in the cluster?

Apologize for naive question though.

Thanks
Santi
