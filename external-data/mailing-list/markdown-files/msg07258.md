Hi everybody,

Yesterday and today I've experienced anomaly in Riak DB.

:list\_keys() is showing 2 keys. Each time I perform this it fetches two
keys but one of them is always different (different key, different value).
So, I guess there are three k/v stored in the DB.

Before that, I had deleted /data directory from all nodes (dev1, dev2,
dev3) to clean the DB.

I didn't change Riak nodes, the settings are identical with Fast Track
tutorial.

Any ideas to fix the problem?

Thanks,
