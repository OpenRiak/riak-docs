Hi Basho folks. I've been looking at some of the new stuff in Riak
2.0 and am very excited about the possibility of replacing my aging
and borderline-overloaded Solr index with a Yokozuna-powered Riak
cluster. I'll be downloading the 2.0 Technical Preview to experiment
with, but I'm curious just how far off (in rough terms, obviously) a
production-ready Riak2.0/Yokozuna is. Have any announcements about
the target release date been made? I haven't seen any. Apologies if
it's been mentioned here, but I looked through the list archives and
didn't see it.
