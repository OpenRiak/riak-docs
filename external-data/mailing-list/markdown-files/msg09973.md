First: Step 2 is talking about how many vnodes exist on a physical server. If 
your ring size is 256, but you have 8 servers â€¦ then your vnode count for step 
2 is 32.

Second: the 2048 is a constant forced by Google's leveldb implementation. It 
is the portion of a file covered by a single bloom filter. This calculation 
constant disappears with the upcoming 1.3 release.

Third: yes there is a "block\_size" parameter that is 4096. Increase that only 
if you want to REDUCE the performance of the leveldb instance. 4096 is a very 
happy value. We have customers and tests with 130K data values, all using 4096 
block size. The block\_size only governs the minimum written (aggregate size of 
small values that must be written as one unit at minimum).

Use 104Mbyte for your average sst file size. It is "good enough"


I am not following the question stream for Step 4 and beyond. Please state 
again.
