Important: Removing/leaving a node from the cluster does NOT automatically 
replicate the data that was on that node to get back up to your desired 
replication level. 

Right now, the suggested method for doing that involves invoking a read on all 
of the keys that were on that node. This forces a read-repair which will cause 
the data to replicate out to nodes that are still alive and in the cluster. 
Something like this:
Do a list-keys on the node you intend to remove, save this file.
Remove the node to be decommissioned.
Add a new node.
Issue a read on every key from the list you created.


However, the list-keys method in 1.0 is not complete if you have lost a node. 
It requires all nodes to be up and running. Effectively, there is no way right 
now to guarantee your replication level on your data in case of a node 
failure/unexpected removal.

This is supposed to be addressed in 1.1:

 https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=991

Also, fwiw, this information came out of a ticket Bump had with Basho to try to 
understand this better. I may be misquoting, and if so, I hope Sean or someone 
will step in and correct me. :)
