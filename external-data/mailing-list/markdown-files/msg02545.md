Hi,
did anyone think of implementing Sergey Melnik's Dremel paradigm (
research.google.com/pubs/archive/36632.pdf) using riak as a framework or at
least sharing some of its code?

Does it make sense at all or as complex as starting from scratch on pure
Erlang/OTP?
>From first sight it seems reasonable given riak's resilience capabilities
combined with Erlang FSM pattern and excellent support for binaries.
