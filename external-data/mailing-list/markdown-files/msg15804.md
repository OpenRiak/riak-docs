Hi Riakators,

weeks.
Fresh
release

 release notes

 - This release includes the fix for RIAK-1482
 
,
 introduced in Riak 2.0.4 and made Map and Set datatypes
unreadable between
 upgrades
 - You can also export admin commands that use clique as CSV, which is
 handy (RIAK-1431
 )
 - Riak CS 1.5.4
 

was
 also released recently and has release notes
 

well
 worth a read

Other
code

 includes connection pooling! Thanks Drew Kerrigan!

  in the works

  when
 building Riak from source

 month and I captured it on Stackoverflow here

and
 gives a helping hand
 - And much more on this month's threads
 

Still
open

 - Cosmin has an interesting edge case that loses an exception in the
 Java Client
 

and
 he'd like others to weigh in
 - Chris has an interesting set of errors
 

that's
 unanswered
 - Shawn found that ACLs are not set correctly for riak-cs
 

which
 may need more investigation
 - Matt Brooks has a very thoughtful question he calls Using Riak for
 Data with many Entities and Relationships
