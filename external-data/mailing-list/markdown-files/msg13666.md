Hi -

I am currently using the PBC implementation of the IRiakClient. Going
through the code, it appears that it is safe to instantiate statically and
share among threads.

I just wanted to verify if this is the case, or it would be preferable to
instantiate a new client each call.

Thanks!

- John
