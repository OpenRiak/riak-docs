Hey Community,

The team at Basho is happy to announce we are extending Webmachine
into its own organization on GitHub:

https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine

The primary owners will be informal to start with Sean Cribbs leading
the change. Please reach out to him to coordinate your involvement
going forward. I’ll stay on as a co-owner to coordinate inside Basho.

You’ll notice the original Webmachine repo is owned by the
organization and we’ve forked a copy back to Basho. All your existing
forks will work just fine, though you may need to recreate your
upstream (if you were pushing directly to the Basho repo):

➜ webmachine git:(develop) git remote -v
upstream https://github.com/basho/webmachine.git (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/basho/webmachine.git (push)
➜ webmachine git:(develop) git remote set-url upstream
https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine.git
https://github.com/basho/webmachine.git
➜ webmachine git:(develop) git remote -v
upstream https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine.git (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine.git (push)


A big thanks is due to Sean Cribbs, Jon Meredith and Heather McKelvey
for helping this move along. We all believe a larger maintainer base
on Webmachine will continue to improve our community as a whole.

Please continue to share this throughout the community.

Best,
Matt Brender
Developer Advocate Lead
