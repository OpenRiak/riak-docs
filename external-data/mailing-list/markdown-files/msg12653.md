Hello,


it's the first post, I've been searching around and having a trobule right now.

I really apologize if this question seems newbie, I've been playing a few riak 
since now.


My problem is that today I tryed to update riak, I was working with this 
versions:

ii riak 1.4.0-1 amd64 
 Riak is a distributed data store
ii riak-cs 1.3.1-1 amd64 
 Riak CS

to update to:

ii riak 1.4.2-1 amd64 
 Riak is a distributed data store
ii riak-cs 1.4.0-1 amd64 
 Riak CS


After upgrading this versions the main node where I have my stanchion server 
and "master" node, crashed when I tryed to start the updated node.

I tryed a downgrade the upgraded server and they start now normally, but I get 
this error:

I paused the node and in the shell get this:

root@rcs1:~# riak-admin ringready
FALSE Node 'riak@10.0.0.1' and 'riak@10.0.0.2' list different partition owners

googling couldn't find info about this and what's next step.

Could you help me out or point me where I could get info for solving this?


Thanks,

cheers,
Jordi.
