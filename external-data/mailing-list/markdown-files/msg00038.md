Hello,

I'm having trouble building with the latest tip on OS X 10.6. Does 0.10
require Erlang R13B04?

$ make
./rebar get-deps
...
==> riak\_kv (get-deps)
Pulling ebloom from {hg,"http://bitbucket.org/basho/ebloom","RELEASE\_2"}
real URL is http://bitbucket.org/basho/ebloom/
destination directory: ebloom
...
==> ebloom (compile)
Compiling c\_src/ebloom\_nifs.cpp
c\_src/ebloom\_nifs.cpp:24: error: expected initializer before â€˜\*â€™ token


Thanks,
Jonathan
