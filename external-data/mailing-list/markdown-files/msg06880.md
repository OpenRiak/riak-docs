Hi,

Has anyone dealt with this error:

 "Protocol: ~p: register error: 
~p~n",["inet\_tcp",{{badmatch,{error,duplicate\_name}}"

 http://hastebin.com/wucipobiho - someone else having the same issue

For some reason and I'm not completely sure of the root cause (something to due 
with epmd is my guess.)

After `riak start` no crash is produced, but any command will see "Node is not 
up"

However, if you run `riak console`, the crash snippet from above is produced.

What's the resolution for this? Even kill -9'ing all riak related processes 
don't fix the issue.

Even weirder is after a long while the issue goes away (or so I've seen on my 
staging environment)

Regards,
 - Rob\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
