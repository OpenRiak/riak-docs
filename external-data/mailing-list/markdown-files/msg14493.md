Hi all,

Today Basho released a minor update to Riak and Riak Enterprise
(version 1.4.10). This is a bug-fix release that addresses a possible
LevelDB compaction loop and an edge case around dead cluster restores
with `riak-admin reip`. In addition, two optional `riak\_search`
configuration options have been added (`range\_loop\_timeout` and
`stream\_timeout`).

More release notes and package downloads are available below:

- https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.4/RELEASE-NOTES.md

https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/commit/94e2c4db2d6998fe7165db0cac8073844b9269e3
- http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/downloads/

(Package repositories have been updated as well.)

As always, thank you for being part of the community.

Sincerely,

The Basho Team
