While someone at Basho is welcome to tweak my suggestion, Riak does
allow you to approach #2 differently--albeit with added complexity.
You can enable siblings and add data into keys as you see fit... Then
reconcile(/+save) when you retrieve that data. That would allow you
to skip having to retrieve, parse, modify, and store your data when
you just need to make trivial updates/additions. When toying around,
I would store "breadcrumbs" in the metadata, to tell future
reconciliations how it should be folded together.

I'd be interested to hear thoughts on the practicality of this
approach, or see if anyone else is doing it.
