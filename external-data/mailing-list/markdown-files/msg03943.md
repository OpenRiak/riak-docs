Greetings,

Thanks for the response. The recommendation on simply taking out the
corrupted buffer file worked! There was indeed single buffer file
(buffer.13), which apparently was causing the crash. Once renamed, the
node stopped hanging on new data inserts. Thanks for the
interpretation of the issue. As for the 'binary' brackets in the data
dump, I can't tell exactly what that it, as it doesn't directly match
any of the data I am writing (json objects that are mainly composed of
string sequences of printable ASCII text). I can share the corrupted
buffer file if that'd be helpful in investigating the root cause.

As for the cause of truncation/corruption - the machine and the
riaksearch node has been continually up for more than 3 months with
two occasional crashes, which looked like this in syslog:

 node kernel: [ 2282.474990] beam[2396]: segfault at 24a5d ip 081016a2
sp bfd68600 error 4 in beam[8048000+15c000]
...
I suspect the corrupted segments might have been caused by beam
segfaults. Anyway, thanks alot for pointers to corrupted buffer files.
This indeed resolved the issue.

Per Rusty's request, here's detailed information of the platform where
the issue was observed:

 What platform are you running?

Debian 5.3 (Lenny)

 What version of Riak Search are you using?

At the time when problem appeared, the riak-search\_0.14.2-1\_i386.deb
was installed on the system. The node was upgraded from
riak-search\_0.14.0-1\_i386.deb (the updade procedure was like
riaksearch stop; dpkg -i ..; riaksearch start)

 Did you install Riak Search from our pre-built binaries, or did
you compile from source?

pre-build binaries (.deb packages)

 If you compiled from source, what version of Erlang are you running?

Erlang R14A (erts-5.8)

 What interface are you using to index the files? (Solr or KV?)

the data is indexed by riaksearch precommit hook when stored in the
bucket (if that was the question)


I'll send email regarding the data sampling offlist
