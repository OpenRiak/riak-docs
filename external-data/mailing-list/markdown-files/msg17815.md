Is anyone storing timestamps with microsecond resolution in RiakTS? 

I'm interested in hearing if anyone is doing this, and how they are doing it. 
My gut reaction is to have a compound timestamp + integer primary key, with the 
microsecond part of the timestamp (least significant digits) going in the 
integer field. 

Any guidance would be great!
