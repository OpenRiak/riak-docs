This was a changed back a few weeks ago, where allow\_mult is back to false
for buckets without a type (default), but is true for buckets with a type.

Sorry for the back and forth, but we decided it would be better to keep it
as false so as to not break existing users. However, we strongly encourage
that all users choose typed buckets going forward.
