Hi All,
 I have a document in which my Riak object is linked with
tag name 'city' to nearly 1000 other objects.
 However, If I use /bucketname/keyname/\_,city,1
 It lists me all cities linked with my object.
 Instead of returning the entire json, I need data
regarding 'chicago' city.
 Please, let me know the syntax for it.

Regards,
Venkatesh.Y
