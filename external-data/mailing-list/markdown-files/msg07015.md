Does riak support optimistic concurrency? This KB article seems to indicate 
not: 
https://help.basho.com/entries/321522-can-riak-be-configured-to-fail-an-update-instead-of-generating-a-conflict

But if it doesn't, what is the meaning of the if\_not\_modified field in the PBC 
Store Object: http://wiki.basho.com/PBC-Store-Object.html?

If strict quorum is used (as described here: 
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2012-January/007157.html)
 will that allow optimistic concurrency to be implemented (once the bugs 
mentioned in the message are fixed)? Is there any update on those bugs?

thanks,
Ransom
