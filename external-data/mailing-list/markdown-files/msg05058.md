What I am trying to model is a concurrent DELETE and a concurrent PUT
where both operations use the same source VClock. When I do a GET
after those concurrent operations is an object with two siblings; One
blank and one with the data.

Is the reconciliation of those two values, the responsibility of the
application and if so, do we need to treat empty bodies as tombstones?

Thanks,
Eric.
