Hi Paul,

Link walking is being deprecated as Christian notes.

We removed it from the official 2.0 clients for that reason, and also
that the new clients only use protocol buffers which on the Riak PB
API side never had that functionality directly.

It is still possible to perform the operation, you just have to do it
through map-reduce (which is what our clients have always done when
using PB)

Thanks,
- Roach
