Hi.

Running riak-cs-1.4.2 here and the /riak-cs/stats endpoint appears to be 
broken. I get 403 error regardless of the configuration settings.

Here's a snippet from app.config:

 %% Port and IP address to listen on for system
 %% administration tasks. Uncomment the following lines
 %% to use a separate IP and port for administrative
 %% API calls.
 {admin\_ip, "127.0.0.1"},
 {admin\_port, 8000 } ,
 {admin\_auth\_enabled, false }, <-- This should let me access the 
/riak-cs/stats endpoint without an authorization


I've changed admin\_auth\_enabled to true, but get the same results passing an 
authorization header.

Anyone else run into this issue?

Thanks,
Dan
