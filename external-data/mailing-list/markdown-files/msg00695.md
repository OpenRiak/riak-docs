I'm looking for some guidance on embedding riak into my existing OTP
applicatio and using the native erlang client. I embedded webmachine a few
months back and it was very simple - just looked at the start scripts and
ported them to my scripts. This doesn't look nearly so easy with riak. Is
this possible since riak isn't purely an erlang app? Would you recommend
the reverse - embedding my app inside of riak?

Thanks,

Kenny Stone
