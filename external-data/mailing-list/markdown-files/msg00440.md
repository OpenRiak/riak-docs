If the intermediate is well-behaving, it should either not care about the 
header, or understand it and deal accordingly. There's nothing in the RFC 
that requires the tag to be of one of the default types. If we used 'rel', 
there might be unintended meanings introduced simply by an application's 
domain-specific use of the tag. Keeping it separate avoids those issues.

How would it "break the interface"? Do you mean that they would lose data? If 
your clients have no knowledge that they are performing writes to Riak, then 
your application shouldn't use the headers. That's why they're X- headers, 
indicating that they are non-standard and application-specific.

Maybe I misunderstand you. How would you envision a generic endpoint?

Yes, you need to know what buckets your application is using. Most 
applications use a limited number of buckets or have deterministic ways to 
compute their names, so this is not generally an issue.

In general, while Riak (via Webmachine) attempts to conform to the HTTP 1.1 
spec, it is first and foremost a database, and so there were some practical 
decisions made that might not fit the purist's worldview. The standards we try 
to meet are:

1) Do we handle the hard parts of HTTP well (e.g. content-negotiation, 
appropriate response codes)?
2) Do we behave predictably when integrated in larger HTTP infrastructures 
(with load-balancers, caches, etc)?

I believe we meet those.
