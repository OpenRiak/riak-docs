That's odd. It should still be firing.

Are you seeing any increase in the postcommit\_fail stats? It may spew a
lot of logging at you, but you could enable debug logging to see if it is
being fired or not.

lager:set\_loglevel(lager\_file\_backend, "console.log", debug).


To reset back to info

lager:set\_loglevel(lager\_file\_backend, "console.log", info).


Please let us know what you find.

Jon.
