Hi Evan/Adron,

Yes, was using risk-python-client.

I had the same experience during dev on local PC (mac) as I didn't have 
protobuf (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) installed.

So I presume the Appfog instances do not have protobuf installed.

Evan - What does this patch do? Does it remove the dependency on protobuf (if 
one is planning to use http only)? Or does it somehow fixes the pip install?
Would you have any ETA on this?

Thanks for the help.
Jimmy
