Hi all,

We are seeing a situation where reading a key that is known to exist
returns no value. The bucket properties are as follows:

{"props":{"allow\_mult":false,"basic\_quorum":false,"big\_vclock":50,"chash\_keyfun":{"mod":"riak\_core\_util","fun":"chash\_std\_keyfun"},"dw":"quorum","last\_write\_wins":true,"linkfun":{"mod":"riak\_kv\_wm\_link\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\_linkfun"},"n\_val":3,"name":"1m","notfound\_ok":true,"old\_vclock":86400,"postcommit":[],"pr":0,"precommit":[],"pw":0,"r":"quorum","rw":"quorum","small\_vclock":50,"w":"quorum","young\_vclock":20}}

Most of the times reading the key returns a value, but sometimes it
doesn't. We are running on a 10 node cluster with AAE turned off.

What could be going on here?

Cheers,

Alain
