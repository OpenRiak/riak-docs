Hi all,

I have some problems with my Riak cluster. Using a Post on a Node for
loading data my memory starts to increase and suddenly after short time
riak crashes. My storage backend is leveldb and the post command is curl -i
-X POST http://localhost:8098/riak/documents/m1 -H "Content-Type:
text/plain" –data-binary @moviesum.txt
The objects are txt documents and each one has 130 mb. The message I´ve
got is a out of memory massage

or

HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.10.0 (never breaks eye contact)
Date: Wed, 02 Jul 2014 10:52:26 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 18
request time out
curl: (6) Couldn´t resolve host `text`

It is a 3 node cluster: Each machine has a CPU of 2x2.4 Ghz with 4GB Ram

Here you can see my configuration for app.config and vm.args

Thanks and Regards,
Chriznewbie
