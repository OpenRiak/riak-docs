Hi Stanislav,

\* Which version of the Python client are you using?

\* Could you please attempt to insert the "liono" document using curl?

curl -vvv -H'Content-type: application/json' -XPUT
localhost:10018/types/animals/buckets/cats/keys/liono -d
'{"name\_s":"Lion-o","age\_i":30,"leader\_b":true}'
