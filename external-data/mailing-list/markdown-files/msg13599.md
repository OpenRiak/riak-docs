Hello,

I recently found out about Riak and wanted to give it a try on my laptop.
 I have Arch Linux running it and I like the OS enough so that I don't want
to install something else in its place.

The problem that I ran into is that I have R16B03 installed (and it works
very well.) I need -- correct me if I'm wrong -- R15B01. However, I'm not
sure how to do the install of R15B01 without over-riding the /usr/bin/erl
symlink.

Now, I'm thinking. How did others tackle this on the same type of distro?
 What would you recommend?
