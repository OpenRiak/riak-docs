Do commit hooks (pre/post/whatever) have any access to parameters of any kind 
(other than document metadata headers)? Can I get the webmachine parameters for 
a given request, for instance?

I'm wanting to find a way to alter behaviour of the hook for each request. The 
only way I can see to do that now is to pass metadata headers, which get stored 
with the document (in the case of a postcommit hook) which is not always what I 
want.

I'd really like the ability to temporarily suspend triggering of the hook for a 
"batch" of operations. The only way I can see to do that now is to actually 
remove the hook from the bucket completely and re-set it afterwards.

Is there a better way to go about this?

Thanks!
