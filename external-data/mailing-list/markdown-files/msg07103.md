Hi Michael, you'll find my responses inline...

Just an FYI, you should checkout `timer:tc`.

What does intra/inter network look like?

It will not read the documents at all but it will sort on score. Currently
there is no way to disable sorting.

Where is your client sitting in regards to your cluster? Is it in the
local network? Could you try attaching to one of your riak nodes, running
the query there and compare results?

e.g.

riak attach
