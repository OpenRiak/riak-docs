Hey All,

Just wanted to let everyone know that we are planning a few Riak 1.0
parties over the coming weeks and months. The first will be in New
York City, and will be happening on September 21.

\* Details are here ---> http://riak1dot0nyc.eventbrite.com/

Hope to see you and your colleagues there if you happen to be in the
area on 9/21. Let me know if you have any questions.

Info about some of the other stuff we are planning should be available
next week.

Thanks,

Mark
