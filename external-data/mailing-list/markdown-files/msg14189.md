Hi!

I've riak-1.4.7.

I've made a HTTP API request, but I would like to know how can I get a json 
response, could anybody help me a little bit, please?

Request:

GET
http://127.0.0.1:10018/solr/index\_bucket/select?q=key:Value
Content-Type: application/json

And I get an xml response body.

Thank you very much!
