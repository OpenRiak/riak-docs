hello all
Im having some problems with building riak from the github sources, on
ubuntu 11
Ive reproduced this issue on one of my home computers and a linode virtual
server, both running ubuntu 11


first of all riak 1.0.1 checkout requires me to have erlang R14B3, which is
confusing to me since the riak\_1.0.1\_i386.deb seems to be working off of
erlang R15A.
the requirement is manifested in a message being spit out half way through
the riak "make rel", about erlang not being of the correct version.
so I compiled a older R14B3 version of erlang and restarted the riak build
process...
it does finish "make rel" then but goes on to require "nodetools" which are
not present in the erts-5.9 which is whats being checked, and is instead
hiding in erts-5.8.4 folder (which is not whats used by riak). so I went
ahead and copied nodetools from 5.8.4 and put it in 5.9... it doesnt
complain about that anymore after that... however then the new memsup
issues pop up, with the Erlang VM dying each time I run "riak start"
without any messages except mentioning memsup as the final issue...

for the memsup issue I did check that ulimit is allowing 1024 file handles,
and have increased that limit further as well, but no luck.



please let me know if you need some more info about my setup, or
thoughts/ideas about what I might be dealing with.



help is appreciated
thanks
