To whom it may concern,


I've set up a 2 riak ts nodes and a load-balancer on independent machines. I'm 
able to successfully create tables, list keys and buckets using the C# SDK but 
am unable to push data in. It returns the following error from


"Expected tsputresp, got rpberrorresp, Expected tsputresp, got rpberrorresp, 
Unable to access functioning Riak node (load balancer returned no nodes)."


I've configured the nodes/load-balancer as per the installation procedure and 
was able to successfully connect the nodes, and configure the load-balancer to 
direct traffic accordingly. May i be missing a setting in the riak.conf to 
enable writing?


Best Regards,

Andre
