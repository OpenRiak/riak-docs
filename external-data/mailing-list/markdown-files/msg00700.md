Carbon-copying to riak-users since this is an important discussion.

You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding about how quorums work. Write 
quorums (W and DW) aren't guarantees of atomicity and [global] consistency, but 
of durability. There's no distributed transaction, two-phase commit, or mutual 
coordination of writes, simply an acknowledgment that the write was received on 
an adequate number of nodes. 

One unintuitive side-effect of these "sloppy quorums" is that a write may 
appear to fail to the client (i.e. not meet quorum), but actually succeed on 
some number of nodes within the cluster. However, on the next read, if the 
nodes that did succeed report in a timely fashion, the previously failed nodes 
will be updated with the new value (read repair).

I tried to place strong caveats on the use of the If-None-Match header and 
read-before-write strategy because they can only be implemented on the 
client-side, and they only are able to present an asynchronously aggregated 
state at the time of request, not a strong guarantee of global consistency. 
Again, buyer beware.
