Hi Yves,

This is less of a distro issue and more of a managing multiple versions of
Erlang issue. I would encourage you to check out either kerl[0] or
erln8[1]. kerl is more mature and well known, but erln8 (written by Basho's
Dave Parfitt) is pretty neat as it allows you to set a specific version of
Erlang to specific paths.

Hope this helps.
