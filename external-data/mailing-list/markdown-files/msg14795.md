Hi there,

I am trying riak search 2, and have followed instructions on
http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/using/search/
to create an index and query an index without any problems.

However, I could not delete values from the index by either i) using the
solr interface, or ii) search-cmd, I followed instructions on
http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/references/search-indexing/

Could you please help?


The error from the solr interface is as follows:


curl -XPOST http://localhost:8098/solr/famous/update -H
'content-type:text/xml' --data-binary @delete.xml

404 Not FoundNot Found

The following is the error by search-cmd:

search-cmd show-schema famous
\*\* The search-cmd tool is for a deprecated version of Riak Search.
\*\* Please upgrade to the new version of Riak Search.
