Hi Guys,

I'm still evaluating riak & riak-cs.

On my five node cluster, with riak only, I am only able to do 2400 requests
per second. I have two keys, one a one byte key, and another a 4kb key, the
performance doesn't change against either.

Is this the best that I can expect to get from this, I don't consider 2400
rps to be significantly high for 5 machines. I'm testing using the http
interface.
