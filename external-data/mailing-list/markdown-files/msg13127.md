Hi,
I have read through many articles about riak but I am little confused how
does riak scale when adding a node. Assume I am having 5nodes having n\_val
of 3 with 8gb Ram and 100gb ebs for each node and they have reached the
capacity of ram and harddisk now I am planning to add one more node to the
cluster to scale but since the n\_val is 3 it will keep adding to old nodes
as well. My question is how does it scale does it move data from old nodes
to the new node rebalance and free up space from old node?

Thanks,
Suman Kumar Dey
