Hi all,
Suppose I have two objects O1 and O2, with O1 having a link (say tag is 
watches) to O2. What is the proper way to delete O2? Should I just delete O2 
and then leave the link inconsistent until I find out and fix it? Or should I 
always check whether that object has links to it and clean them up before 
deleting the object. Please advise
José
