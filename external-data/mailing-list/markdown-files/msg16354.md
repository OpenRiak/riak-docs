Hi riak-users,

Thanks for your reply. However, I have some problems with my riak cluster.
It's pending on leaving status for 7 days after I removed 4 new added nodes.

Today I detached the network bond(we used the bond mode 6/0) in several
nodes of the riak cluster. After that, "ifconfig" command show decreased
"dropped" packages,
There're only 1~2 dropped network packages during the last four hours.

However, I want to know what's the status of the Riak cluster?
Currently I started riak-cs service on four new nodes. That's ok, they can
service.
how many hours those four node will take to leave the cluster?
