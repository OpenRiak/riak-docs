Hey Brian,

That fork was put in place temporarily until the
riak\_cs\_kv\_multi\_backend specific bits were merged into
basho/riak-chef-cookbook. As of right now, the changes have been
merged, but the Berkshelf reference (in
hectcastro/vagrant-riak-cs-cluster) hasn't been updated. The primary
Chef cookbooks for Riak and Riak CS are:

\* https://github.com/basho/riak-chef-cookbook
\* https://github.com/basho/riak-cs-chef-cookbook

As soon as the we resolve issues with Vagrant 1.1+ and Berkshelf, the
vagrant-riak-cs-cluster repository references will be updated.
