Is there any way to tune Riak to produce predictable latency? I have
been experimenting with a three node cluster and tuning the
frag\_merge\_trigger and frag\_threshold bitcask parameters but no matter
what I set them to, I get very inconsistente latency numbers. Latency
seems to increase quite significant as soon as a merge starts.

Thanks,
Tony
