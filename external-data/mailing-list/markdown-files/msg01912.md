The current consistent hashing scheme was chosen because it tends to produce an 
even (random) spread across the cluster. In general, you should want to avoid 
hotspots because they will limit availability and concurrency. However, you are 
free to use a different hashing scheme if you like, as long as it produces keys 
in the same 160-bit keyspace. You may have noticed there's an example chash 
function riak\_core that hashes only the bucket.
