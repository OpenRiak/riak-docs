I am working on bindings for the HTTP API for lisp, the docs list new and
old URLs for requests, but it appears that not all of the new URLs are
implemented yet? I am using 1.0.2 is there a planned release number for
supporting all of the new URL formats?

These don't seem to be working with the new URL format:

Get bucket:
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test

Set bucket:
curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{"props":{"n\_val":5}}' http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test

Store object:
curl -v -d 'this is a test' -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test

Thanks,
Jordan
