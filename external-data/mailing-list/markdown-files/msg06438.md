Gal, 

The limiting factor on EC2 will likely be IOPs (i.e. Disk throughput). EC2 is a 
IOPs constrained environment, especially if you're using EBS. Further, doing a 
leave can induce a large number of ownership changes to ensure that preflists 
maintain the appropriate n\_vals. The number of partitions that need to be 
shuffled can exceed 80% of all partitions. In short, it can take a while for 
the rebalance to complete. Assuming you're using a >=1.0 release, you're 
cluster should still correctly respond to all incoming requests.

Which version of Riak are you using? As of Riak 1.0.3, `handoff\_concurrency`, 
the number of outgoing handoffs per node, is set to 1. This will reduce the 
rate at which the rebalance occurs, but it reduces the impact of the rebalance 
on your cluster.
