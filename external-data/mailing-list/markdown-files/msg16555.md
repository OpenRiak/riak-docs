Hi Hristo,

I had this experience when the consistency subsystem was not ready.

I use riak-admin ensemble-status to check it. It may take 10 minutes to have it 
ready. 

What HW are you using? How many nodes are up? Do you use your laptop for alk 
the nodes or you experience the situation in a production envirinment? Whar 
version of RIAK are you working with?

Regards,
Zsolt
