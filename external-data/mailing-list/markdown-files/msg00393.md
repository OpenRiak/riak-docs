Hi,

when calling the filter\_keys/2 API with innostore configured as backend 
I get the following error in the riak node.


{badarg,[{innostore\_riak,list\_bucket,2},
 {riak\_vnode,do\_list\_bucket,6},
 {riak\_vnode,active,2},
 {gen\_fsm,handle\_msg,7},
 {proc\_lib,init\_p\_do\_apply,3}]}

Looking at innostore\_riak.erl it seems to me that list\_bucket/2 doesn't 
expect to receive a tuple such as {filter, Bucket, Fun} as second argument.
It's easy to fix and we got it working, just wondering if you know about 
it...


Kind regards
Francesca
