Hi~@list,

I'm new to riak. When I use HTTP API to delete a bucket, I got a response as 
following.
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed [Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.9.0 (someone 
had painted it blue), Date: Wed, 21 Dec 2011 05:24:33 GMT, Content-Length: 0, 
Allow: HEAD, GET, PUT]

Is there a way to make Delete operation allowed?


Thanks
