Hi

We barely made riak, riak-cs and stanchion work in ubuntu 14.04 x64
server. Now we can't setup the admin user, for clarification the
anonymous\_user\_creation is on, we even get the warning that is on in
the logs

We are doing the following, as documented


curl -XPOST http://192.168.0.163:8080/riak-cs/user \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"email":"b...@ble.bli", "name":"admin"}'

(note, the email address is changed for privacy)


But it returns

500 Internal Server
ErrorInternal Server Error
=====================

The server
encountered an error while processing this request

Any help will be appreciated, this is my fist time posting in a
mailing list, apologies if I did something wrong.



Thanks!
