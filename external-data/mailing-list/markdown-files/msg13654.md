Hi all,
I've a big question... if you have to go in production in the next two
months (about at the half/end of April) you use Riak 1.4 or 2.0 pre-x
???
How hard will it be to upgrade from 1.4 to 2.0?
At the moment I don't need new features (crdt) of 2.0 version. Maybe
only new simpler configuration will be useful.
More important: I'm using the python client: does it work with 2.0?
Thanks
Massimiliano
