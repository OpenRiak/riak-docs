1. I use a one node deployment all the time for development. I jut tune the n 
val to 1. 

3. Store whatever data you like. (Riak is being used in healthcare to store med 
data.) Unless it's transactional. Aka. +50$ to A from B, -50$ from B to A. I 
would not use riak for that. 

Cheers, 
Alexander
