Even when you run a MapReduce query over a single bucket, MapReduce has to
contact a majority of nodes in the cluster to perform a coverage query. In
effect, you're scanning all of the keys to make sure you find only the keys
in a single bucket. MapReduce can work for limited scenarios (e.g. mutating
the state of a large number of objects or running batched analytics that
write to a separate set of buckets/keys) but people have reported
unsatisfactory results when trying to use MapReduce for live querying.

This sort of thing may be possible with the Riak Search 2.0 functionality
as well. I haven't played around with it enough to know whether it would be
a good fit or not.

"Keys will consist of a timestamp and userID."

Sounds like you could sort on that to me.

The $bucket index is a special index that only contains a list of the keys
in a bucket. Querying $bucket is cheaper than a list keys operation.

There are a number of ways you can solve this problem that are all
implementation dependent.

A list keys is not a $bucket index query. See "Retrieve all Bucket Keys via
$bucket Index" at http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/2i/

It sounds to me like you're doing an awful lot of work to do something that
a relational database handles remarkably well.
