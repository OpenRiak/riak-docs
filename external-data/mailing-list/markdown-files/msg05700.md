Walter,

There are three settings you can adjust in the riak app.config file that 
control the number of javascript vms: map\_js\_vm\_count, reduce\_js\_vm\_count, and 
hook\_js\_vm\_count. If you are doing a lot of javascript mapreduce and seeing the 
error you mentioned, increase the map and reduce vm counts and that should help.
