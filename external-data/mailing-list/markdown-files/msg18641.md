Hey Bryan,

Something similar in the RabbitMQ code base made me go "huh" the other
day. Calls to rabbit\_log\_ldap module functions when no such module
exists. Turns out there's a parse transform defined that turns these
calls into lager function calls to an extra sink:

https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common/blob/master/mk/rabbitmq-build.mk#L46

I couldn't find any instance of object\_lager\_event:info (debug,
warning, etc) function calls in the Riak code I have lying around,
though, so /shrug

Good luck -
Luke
