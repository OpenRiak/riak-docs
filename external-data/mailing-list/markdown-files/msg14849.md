Alex,

If you want to use apt to install Riak, then packagecloud.io is what you
need to do since we are not updating our [apt|yum].basho.com repos moving
forward. We need to update our documentation, so I'll get on that right
away.

Right now an upgrade is available for Riak (2.0.0 rather than rc1). Go
ahead and do that upgrade and let me know if you still have problems.

Using the scripts provided by packagecloud.io is the best way to ensure the
repository is setup correctly on your system.

Sorry for your trouble,
-Jared
