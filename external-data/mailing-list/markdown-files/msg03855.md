There was this post on this mailing list with no follow up:
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.riak.user/3197. The main point
of the question is ' how does one re-index a KV bucket? ' during
riaksearch-admin backup/restore operations. In our experience the
data is not indexed (and does not get reindexed) unless you create
pre-commit hook before restoring the data. I wonder if anyone else
could comment on this issue?
