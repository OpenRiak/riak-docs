Hello, 

Recently we migrated our Riak nodes to another network, so we backup the data 
and then regenerate the ring, all is well, but there is a strange behaviour in 
a riak search, for example if we execute a query using the riak\_erlang\_client, 
returns the objects in the order:

A, B, C

And then if we execute again the same query the result is:

B, A, C, 

So, in other order, do you know what is causing this?, before to change our 
riak ring to another network, it was working perfectly.

Thank you
