Hi,

What is the recommended way of deleting all of the keys in a bucket?

Is there a way to delete all the keys without impacting the read
performance of the cluster, like a low priority clean up job?

I found the following script so far (I guess running it at off peak
would be solving the priority problem):

Is this good, bad approach?

Thanks in advance,
Istvan
