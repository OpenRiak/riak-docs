Has anyone managed to compile or otherwise install riak on FreeBSD?

It seems that since almost year ago this issue was reported nothing
much has been done on this one. I've put in a fair effort attemting to
install riak on FreeBSD but without much success and I am about to
give up.

The best I can get is (after making all the tweaks suggested on this
mailing list):

erlang\_js/c\_src/system/lib -lnspr4
ld: FreeBSD8.1-RELEASE-p1\_OPT.OBJ/jsapi.o: relocation R\_X86\_64\_32S can
not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
FreeBSD8.1-RELEASE-p1\_OPT.OBJ/jsapi.o: could not read symbols: Bad value
gmake[3]: \*\*\* [FreeBSD8.1-RELEASE-p1\_OPT.OBJ/libjs.so] Error 1
gmake[3]: Leaving directory `/root/riak2/riak/deps/erlang\_js/c\_src/js/src'

Unfortunately, when I (and probably some other people too) are faced
with a dilemma of whether to 'change OS' or to 'pass on a promising
DB' chances are that the later will be prefered, hello again MongoDB.
