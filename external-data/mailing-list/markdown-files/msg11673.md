Thanks a lot, Jeremiah! Your answers really help clarify the issues.

Just one more question, by "document-based indices", do you mean
document-based partitioning for the indices? Because what I found in the
online document
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/search/#Search-KV-and-MapReduceis
"Search
uses term-based partitioning â€“ also known as a global index." I am not sure
if the implementation has changed for the latest version of Riak, but if
term-based partitioning is used, does that mean Riak will only schedule the
mappers after the whole list of  pair is returned from the
index?

Thanks,
Xiaoming
