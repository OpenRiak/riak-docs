Hi guys,

Am currently designing the data schema for an application; I have a
question hoping some of you could help. Thanks in advance.

One of the functionalities is a 'like button' to posts

Each post is stored as an object in Riak, eg /post/

To like a post, I am planning on creating a link from user object to the
post object, and the reverse direction, such that it would be easier to
link-walk/mapreduce.

My question is, if a particular post is very very popular, and everyone is
pressing 'like'. Would the write requests (to the post's object header)
conflict each other?

Is the above a bad schema design from that perspective? Any suggestion of
a better design?

Thanks.
Regards, Jimmy
