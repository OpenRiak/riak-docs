Just wondering if anyone else in Riakland would be interested in a post commit 
hook that could trigger an IronWorker or send an IronMQ message (using the REST 
API)?

I have a need for one myself for a iOS photography app I'm experimenting with 
(when I have free time...which is almost never!) and wondered if anyone else is 
using a similar stack and would benefit from making it Apache 2.0 and available 
on GitHub.

Thanks!
