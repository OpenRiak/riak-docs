Hi Elias,

Yes, you've encountered a known bug, tracked here:
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=867

MapReduce is one way to solve this issue. Another approach, depending on how
frequently the query changes, would be to read and cache the result set
somewhere, and then paginate from there.

Best,
Rusty
