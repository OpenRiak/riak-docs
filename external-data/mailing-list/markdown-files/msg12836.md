Riak Users,

Following up on the 2.0 Configuration thread [1], I wanted to also provide
some documentation on the new Bucket Types [2] feature in Riak 2.0 Tech
Preview. https://gist.github.com/jrwest/3652ecd1db609e25cdaa contains
details on how to create and activate bucket types via riak-admin.

You will need to create Bucket Types to try the new Datatypes and Strong
Consistency features.

couple of notes: the use of JSON in the bucket-type commands will change
between the tech preview and final release of Riak 2.0 [3] and there is
currently a small inconvenience when creating types that have all default
properties [4].
