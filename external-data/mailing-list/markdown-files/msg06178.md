I am trying to install Riak in my macbook. I installed erlang using "sudo port 
install erlang +ssl" . When i do a "make all" in riak, i get the below error 
and it quits.

I am trying to install the source as mentioned 
http://wiki.basho.com/Building-a-Development-Environment.html. For some weird 
reason, when i install the tarball, i am not able to connect to 8091 and also I 
am not able to find the number of partitions. How do I configure the port where 
riak is running and the number of partitions in tarball? 

Thanks
Suresh Chandran
