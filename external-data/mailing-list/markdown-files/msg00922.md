Hi there,

I'm new to Riak and starting to evaluate it for an application we're
building. So far, I'm quite impressed. But I'm having some trouble
wrapping my head around what happens exactly in the event of a node failure.
 In this section of the wiki:

https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Replication#Replication-SowhatdoesN%3D3reallymean%3F

it states that there's no guarantee that the replicas will reside on
different machines. Does this mean that it's possible for all N copies of a
given datum to end up on the same machine? Is there any way to avoid this,
so that a single node failure won't result in data loss?

Thanks!
Tony
