Jeff,

We highly recommend you upgrade to 10.10 or later. 10.04 has some known
problems when running under Xen (especially on EC2) -- in some cases under
load, the network interface will break, making the node temporarily
inaccessible.

When you do upgrade, the simplest way (if possible) would be to remount the
attached EBS volumes where your Riak data is stored onto the new nodes.
Otherwise, the steps you list are correct.

Regarding swap, whether you have it on or not is a personal decision. Riak
will "do the right thing" and exit when it can't allocate more memory,
allowing you to figure out what went wrong -- as opposed to grinding the
machine into IO oblivion while consuming more and more swap. That said, in
some deployments (notably not on EC2), swap can be helpful.

Hope that helps,
