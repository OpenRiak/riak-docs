Glad to be of help. For yet another shameless plug, I'm actually
tinkering with my branch of Rekon to make interacting with erlang
modules (modify code paths, create, compile, load modules on the fly)
more convenient. Obviously there are security considerations, but for
now I think the M/R interface will benefit from Lewis & Clark-style
exploration.
