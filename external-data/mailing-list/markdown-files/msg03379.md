It works fine for me under three scenarios:

(a) your example, with riak 0.14, riak-js 0.4 and node 0.4.7
(b) riak-js tests (fixture is an image)
(c) my own app that does exactly that for certain images

The only thing that differs from your example is that i'm using the
Luwak interface (getLarge instead of get). So last thing i can think
of is that the image variable is not a Buffer. Could you check that?
