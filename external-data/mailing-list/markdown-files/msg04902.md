Hi,

We were wondering what is the best possible way to perform "AND / OR" queries 
in RiakSearch. It seems OR works but how do I perform an AND on the same field.

For example:

DATA:

{a : "test" } {a: "test"} {a: "test2"}

"test" OR "test2" would return both. But, we are looking to return AND query 
result, since obviously "test2" AND "test" won't return anything.

So, we are looking for guidance on how do we store data in such a way that AND 
queries would be possible.

Whats the best recommended approach both prior to 1.0 and 1.0 going forward.


Thanks
Harshal
