Hello Riak Users!

Big bits. Riak 1.4 hit the streets earlier this week. With key new
features, some changes and other goodness. From Client API additions to
binary format improvements to pagination support in 2i, there's a host of
new things to check out.

In other key news blurbs, not from Gelett Burgess:

\* Going beyond half the RICON East videos, more are going live by the day.

\* Basho is hiring a few more Technical Evangelists, specifically in Austin,
TX and the Washington, D.C., area. If you or someone you know is interested
in making Riak the biggest database in the world (adoption, not LOC), ping
me. Check out this blog post if you're looking for more info on what the
TEs do here at Basho.
