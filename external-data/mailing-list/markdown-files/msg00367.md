hey guys,

given that i have an array of keys and want to return the related documents.
what would be the best way to do this?
so far i can think of two ways

1. open a socket and call RpbGetReq asynchronously for each key
2. run a map reduce through the rest interface and deserialise the results

is there a 3rd way?

regards,
gareth stokes
