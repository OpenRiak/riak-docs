I would note that it's possible to configure a periodic sync still
with bitcask on Linux; it's just going to be a bit more overhead since
it's a full fsync vs. nominal sync per write.

Yes, we'll support that, hopefully in time for 1.0. Of note, that uses
a fdatasync() after \_each\_ write, so it will probably be quite
expensive.
