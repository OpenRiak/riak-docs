I've been rewriting a small app of ours to run on Riak instead of MongoDB and
I've run into a bug or weird behavior. To show this off I created a very simple 
little
Rails 3 app where this happens. It can be found here:

git://github.com/johnae/Riak-Rails-Ripple-Test-to-show-some-weird-behavior.git


Perhaps I'm doing something wrong but the app has two models, Client and 
Address.

A Client has one Address and an Address has one Client. I've created a form to 
just add
addresses at /addresses/new and one for clients at /clients/new. There is only 
a single text
field in /addresses/new - just add a few of them. Then go to /clients/new where 
you can enter
a name for the client and select an address in a select box. Hit Save, then you 
get something like this:

Invalid value "R2HQfdNWBz4TtxbYgZBLKIriTwl" for association address of type 
Address on 

This is the same type of error I get in the larger app I'm working on and I 
can't figure out whats
wrong (me or Ripple I guess)...
