Riak Recap for April 6 - 9
===================

1) If you're at Philadelphia ETE this week, keep an eye out for Tom Santero
and Ryan Zezeski.

\* Details here ---> http://basho.com/blog/technical/2012/04/09/Philly-ETE/

2) Pavlo Baron has a new repo up on GitHub that looks pretty promising.
He's writing some code that makes it possible to port an app running
MongoDB to use Riak as a backend. The code is still pretty young, but
anyone who gets this up-and-running with a new or existing Mongo app and
tells the list or the interner about is getting a bunch of Riak gear from
me.

\* Code here. Have fun. ---> https://github.com/pavlobaron/riak\_mongo

3) The Monitis crew put together a blog post with some details on what you
might want to monitor in Riak.

4) Tom Arnfeld wrote up some notes about getting Riak running Ubuntu
11.10. (Keep in mind that you'll need to modify the vm.args file if you
want to start Riak using this on more than one node.) Thanks, Tom!
