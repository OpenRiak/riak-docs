Riak Recap for 4/21 - 4/22

1) seancribbs and adamhunter had brief but valuable convo in IRC about
removing a node from a cluster. It might be of interest to some of
you. Check it out here:

2) We added some new wiki pages that have in-depth information on a
few 0.10 features:

a. Read up on Pre- and Post- Commit Hooks here:
http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Pre-+and+Post-Commit+Hooks

b. Info on the Protocols Buffers Client API here:
http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/PBC+API

c. Details on the Protocol Buffers based Erlang client here:
http://wiki.basho.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1245522


3) We also added a new section to the wiki called "Best Practices."
You'll notice that it's sparsely populated at the moment. Don't fret.
There is plenty more to come.

But before we put some time against it I wanted to ask: What do you
all want to see added here? Which "Best Practices" would help you the
most?


4) chids (aka @martengustafsen) posted a bad-ass picture in IRC made
possible by the top-secret app he is working on:

 Android + GPS -> Riak + CouchDB -> Java Image API = Yesterdays lunch stroll @

specifically, what their Riak app makes possible) will get a fresh
Riak T-shirt.
