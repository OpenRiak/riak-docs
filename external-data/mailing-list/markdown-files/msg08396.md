Hi,

I poked and prodded some more, and figured out that 'fl' is a field
filter that is useful to me, basically doing what I was doing with MR
in the prior version. (Would be nice to see an example of this in the
updated docs)

I noticed a couple things using the search API and have these comments/questions

1. Seems like the server squeezes an <<"id">> field at the start of
each result object. We already have an embedded "id" field in our json
objects, so I'm getting 2 <<"id">>'s here. It would be nice if this
were removed from the object fields, but clearly I could see how it's
useful to know the object key in its bucket, so a format like this
might be nicer
{<<"index">>, <<"key">>, [{<<"field1">>, <<"foo">>}, {<<"field2">>,
<<"Bar">>}...]}

2. In my particular query, I'm getting a small number (5 out of 37) of
the fields repeated within each object at the end of the proplist. The
values, fortunately, are identical to the ones earlier in the object.
I wonder if this is related to indexing or something like that?
Unfortunately, I did not configure our Riak search and can't say
definitively whether I have secondary indices on those or not.

Thanks
Julian
