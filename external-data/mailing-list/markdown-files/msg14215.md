Hello All,

I'm new to Riak/Bitcask. The documentation and FAQs were very useful.

I had a question about the keys that expired in riak/bitcask using
'expiry\_secs'.
Assuming I use the auto generated keys,

1. When a key expires, will the same key be reused at a later stage?
2. Can I change the length of the auto-generated key (say to 4 bytes) ?

I really appreciate the help.
Thank You.
