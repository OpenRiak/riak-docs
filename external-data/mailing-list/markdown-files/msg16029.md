Greetings Riak Users!

Yesterday we released the awaited rewrite for the Official PHP client for Riak 
supporting version 2 features (bucket types, CRDTs, and user authentication 
over TLS). The library uses the HTTP interface to communicate with Riak and 
requires PHP version 5.4 or newer as well as the JSON and cURL PHP extensions.

It's available via composer:

https://packagist.org/packages/basho/riak 


Simply add the following to your composer.json file within your project:

 "require": { "basho/riak": "2.0.\*" },

The github repo can be found here:

https://github.com/basho/riak-php-client 


API docs are published here:

http://basho.github.io/riak-php-client/ 


Thanks,
Christopher Mancini
