Hi,
We have a situation where our production riak cluster is missing config
information. Specifically, we are running bitcask as our backend and we did
not define an expiry\_secs value, meaning data lives forever (which we don't
want).

Question: If we changed the config and define expiry\_secs, does the expiry
condition apply to all existing data or only to new data?

Thanks in advance
