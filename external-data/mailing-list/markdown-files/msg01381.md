Thanks, Seth. That's a fine solution if I'm loading terms into riak from an 
erlang client. My question, though, is what if I want to use the http interface 
to do the loading. Since I can load arbitrary data types into riak, it strikes 
me that, in principle, there might be a way to do this. In practice, though, 
perhaps there isn't.
