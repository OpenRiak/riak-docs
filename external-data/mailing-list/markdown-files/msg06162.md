Riak Recap for January 4 - 5
=====================

1) Bip Thelin's "Zerolog" project is now using Riak instead of Mnesia.

\* More here ---> https://twitter.com/#!/bipthelin/status/154890873744797697

2) Basho Developer Scott Lystig Fritchie wrote an extensive blog post
about TCP Incast and how it can affect Erlang applications.

3) Related to #2: Voxer is using Riak to do billions of operations per
day. (You should all be using Voxer on your smart phones if you're not
already. Go download it.)

4) UnityPark has some docs up on their site on how to use Riak with
their game development environment.
