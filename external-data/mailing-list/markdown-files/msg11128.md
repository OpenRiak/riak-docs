Dear list,

What is your take on the conclusions drawn in the following blog post?

In our setup, we occasionally suffer lost data through simultaneous writes
to the same key - which I mitigate to some extent with locks in the
application layer. In fact, the resolution in the application is
essentially like the "merge" technique he describes with the CRDTs solution
at the end.

Would the CRDT approach he talks about replace the locks in my application
layer (where simultaneous LWW causes overwrites of a single object)?

I suppose I'm left with the feeling that I don't understand enough of the
workings of Riak and the implications of CAP to really understand this post
on my own.

Anything anyone can offer on the subject would be most appreciated!

Cheers
