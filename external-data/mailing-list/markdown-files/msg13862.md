Yes, I have used the configuration like above.

The leveldb folder still has 100+Gb used unlike the cluster that has
not been used for basho\_bench testing. The "real" data size is 10G.
Also, when I try to list the keys for the test bucket it behaves
exactly like before, not like an empty bucket.

Istvan
