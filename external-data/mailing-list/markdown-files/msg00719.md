Giving just a bucket WILL traverse the entire keyspace.
Here is a conversation I had on IRC yesterday (GMT+1).

[4:18pm] danoyoung: this may be obvious, but I just want to confirm,
on the QA session from the last webinar, it was stated that listing
keys for a given bucket requires examining keys that don't belong to
the requested bucket.....
[4:18pm] danoyoung: So if I have a number of buckets, one with say
1000 objects in it, but I have 25 million objects scatter throughout a
number of buckets (on a given node), then a M/R query would need to
visit all 25 million even though I'm only interested in the 1000
objects?
[4:21pm] justinsheehy: yes, that's correct. (if you specify the M/R
by bucket instead of getting the input keylist some other way)
[4:21pm] justinsheehy: this is because the backends aren't required to
separate the buckets in any way, and in some cases simply use {bucket,
key} as their internal key.
[4:21pm] justinsheehy: that's what allows buckets to be "free"
[4:23pm] nfo: justinsheehy: so same behavior with "GET
/riak/bucket?keys=true" I suppose.
[4:23pm] danoyoung: hmm..ok, thanx. so it seems that I'll need to have
a secondary index somewhere (w/n riak or else) to keep track of all my
keys w/n a given bucket...
[4:24pm] justinsheehy: nfo: yes, that's effectively the same thing
[4:24pm] danoyoung: to avoid expensive list keys operations....
[4:27pm] nfo: justinsheehy: about this, I find "sad", for beginners,
that the Fast Track gives an example of a bucket listing without any
warning. It's the very first map/reduce Riak query a person sees, and
it's not efficient.
[4:27pm] nfo: {"inputs":"goog",
[4:27pm] nfo: 
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Loading+Data+and+Running+MapReduce+Queries
[4:28pm] justinsheehy: nfo: fair enough, I'll make sure that gets (at
least) a note.
[4:28pm] danoyoung: if I had buckets with tens of thousands of object
in them, then what would be the most effecient way to run M/R against
them all, break up into multiple M/R jobs that process say 500
bucket/key values at a time...tand then aggregate these results....
[4:28pm] danoyoung: i meant 5000...
[4:28pm] seancribbs: danoyoung: knowing the keys AOT is crucial
[4:31pm] seancribbs: so if you have some way to build objects that
have links to the objects you want to query across, and the first ones
have intuitive keys, you'll avoid the cost of list-keys
