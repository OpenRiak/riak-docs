One quick question on the Riak Java Client. 

Brian Roach seemed to have been the only active contributor to this. Recently 
he mentioned that he's leaving Basho though, so I was wondering if he'll be 
maintaining this moving forward. 

Since the Riak Java client is now a fundamental part of our ecosystem, I'm very 
interested in its destiny (as probably many others are)
Consequently, if there's no one on this right now, I'm happy to help out with 
current and future issues as my time allows it. 

Looking forward to hearing from you

Cheers
Cos
