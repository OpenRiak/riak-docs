It's the protocol/server that limits the set of properties you can set.

https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/blob/1.0/src/riak\_kv\_pb\_socket.erl#L441

https://github.com/basho/riak-erlang-client/blob/1.2.0/src/riakc\_pb.erl#L260

https://github.com/basho/riak-erlang-client/blob/1.2.0/src/riakclient.proto#L262

I can see how always returning `ok` is confusing and wasted your time.
 Sorry about that. I'm not sure why it is the way it is, but I'm sure it
just happens to be this way and wasn't the result of any deep thought.
