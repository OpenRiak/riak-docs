Mark,

We have 5 x ec2 m1.large nodes with 30GB data each, stored in LevelDB
backend.

I've already started building a copying tool, that will first run m/r on a
source cluster,
dumping the keys to a disk. Then several processes will run through the
keys and load
the data to the destination cluster.

Here is my initial version (still sequential):
