Hi Charles,

AFAIK we haven't ever tested Riak Cs with the MapR connector. However, if
MapR works with S3, you should just have to change the IP to point to a
load balancer in front of your local Riak CS cluster. I'm unaware of how to
change that setting in MapR though. It seems like a question for them and
not Basho.
