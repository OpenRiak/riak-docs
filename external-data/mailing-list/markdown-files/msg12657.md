Great everyone, thank you.

@Russell: I specifically work with either Go (
https://github.com/tpjg/goriakpbc) or Ruby (basho client). I haven't
tested the ruby client, but I'd assume it will perform the write without
the read (based on my reading of the code). The Go library, on the other
hand, currently always performs a read prior to the write. It's an easy
patch that I've already applied locally for benchmarking, I just didn't
want to submit the PR till I was sure this was the correct behavior.

Somewhat off topic, but I dont' want to open up another thread if it's
unnecessary. This questions arose because I've been doing extensive
benchmarking around distributed counters. Are there pre-existing
benchmarks out there that I can measure myself against? I haven't stumbled
across many at this point, probably because of how new it is.

Cheers,
Wes
