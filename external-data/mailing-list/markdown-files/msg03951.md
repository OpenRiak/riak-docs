Any update on the possibility of getting an APT/PPA repository for Debian
users?
A ppa repo hosted on Launchpad would be keen :-)

I'm sure the RHEL guys would like a YUM repo as well.

Repository support is a must, as it can improve the chances of getting
non-Riak users to try it out (copy/pasting a .deb URL is so 2005, hehe), and
will allow us to upgrade Riak along with the rest of the server instead of
having to monitor Riak releases separately.

Thanks!
