The Java client puts connection management down in the transport layer. It 
makes sense to me.

I had a chat with Reid Draper about it (he is much more pythonic than me), he 
concurs. I just need to do a bit more reading through the code, and unless 
anyone here objects (anyone? class? anyone?), I'll start work at merging your 
fork into the Basho repo so we can get back on track.

Thanks a lot for your time and patience on this Greg, we're lucky to have you.

Cheers

Russell
