Dear all,

I have a riak running in only one node for about 6 months without problems.
Yesterday the riak's server was power off without previous halt. Now riak
is crashing in few seconds/minutes after start. In log files I can see
problems with merge and maybe corruption of some data. Is there an option
to recover the data or exclude what is corrupted?

The kind of message that is in log files is:

2012-06-29 15:18:45.385 [error] <0.3733.0> Hintfile
