Man I go away for a few hours for family time and off things go ;)

So this lead to some interesting convos on twitter and here. Others have
addressed some things. I figure it helps to explain the sad lonely world I
live in - It's called "Enterprise".

A few folks are somewhat aware that our product uses Riak under the covers.
We have a hosted SaaS version and we also allow customers to install it
entirely isolated on their own networks. The only people who do this are
traditional enterprises.

The very first question that comes up during an installation after "you
need HOW many servers?" is "How do I back this up". Since we use LevelDB,
we have the worst of backup options - coordinated node shutdown and
tarball'ing. The thing is we can't say to them "you never need to back this
up. Just add more nodes!"

That doesn't check the box they have. That doesn't meet the legal and
industry guidelines they have to follow. So now that they've swallowed the
"you need 5 servers just for the DB" we now hit them with "your backup
strategy involves this complicated orchestrated shutdown process and some
tarballs". When faced with that, we ran into a new issue. They started
doing vm snapshots and stupid shit like vmotioning the instances (oh yes,
they virtualize it =/).

If you aren't familiar with vmotion, it's basically vmware's bullshit that
says they can somehow defy the laws of physics. If you read the details on
exactly what vmotion does (hint - it doesn't actually take the node offline
- vmware just "buffers" the pending network requests among other things),
you can see how this can TOTALLY fuck up Riak clusters.

Anyway so this is the world we have to live in and we have to provide
something that resembles a backup they can DR from. Our normal course of
action is to tell them to contact Basho for RiakDS and go multi-site. SAN
based snapshots largely meet that need for them.

For what it's worth, this is not just a problem with Riak and there are
legitimate use cases for wanting to have a "copy" of production data for
testing new code against. The biggest problem is once you get data IN to
riak (and other stores), it's REALLY difficult to prune it outside of
expensive "walk all the things", an external index of some kind or
resorting to application-level business logic tooling.

I'm not making a judgement call. Trade offs are a thing but it's definitely
a issue. At this point I'm considering resorting to a post-commit hook
machination of some kind.
