The N replication factor determines reliability of the data. If you have
N=1, losing one node of the cluster means you have DEFINITELY lost data. On
the other hand, the value of raising N diminishes iteratively and begins to
waste resources. So it depends: if you don't care about losing data (e.g.
if you can just replace the missing documents), lower N as needed.
