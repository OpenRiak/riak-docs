Nathaniel,

I'll have to go through the commit log, but I'm fairly confident that this bug 
was fixed. I just tried it and am not prompted with the password. If you do a 
`git log` in deps/riak\_control, what's the latest commit SHA that you have?

Also, when you use 'none' as the authentication method, there's no need to use 
HTTPS. So, give going to http://ip.com:8098/admin and see if that works for you 
without authenticating (note: SSL should still work as well and not ask for 
credentials).

I'll take a look at the code again, though. Let me know if HTTP doesn't work 
for you as it should.
