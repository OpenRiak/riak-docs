HI All,

The Basho wiki states that:
The $key index field is a special field that is implicitly indexed on all 
objects when Secondary Indexes is enabled. The value of this field is the 
object's key, so this field allows an application to perform range queries 
across the keys in a bucket.

What is the REST API to use this special field? And what would be the the 
corresponding read URI?

Thanks,
Izhar.
