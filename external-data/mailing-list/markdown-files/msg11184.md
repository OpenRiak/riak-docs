Eh hem. 

This is exactly what we're doing in our production environment--a pair of disks 
in each node striped RAID 0, and we rely entirely on Riak for all replication 
and recovery. No issues so far after 5 months of production use in this 
configuration.

Then again, we haven't lost any drives in that time... :-)
