The docs http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/configuring/basic/#ring-size
seem to imply that there's no easy, non-destructive way to change a
cluster's ring size live for Riak-1.4x.

I thought about replacing one node at a time, but you can't join a new node
or replace an existing one with a node that has a different ring size.

I was also thinking of bring up a completely new cluster with the new ring
size, and then replicating the data from the original cluster, and take a
quick maintenance window to failover to the new cluster.

One other alternative seems to be to upgrade to 2.0, and then use 2.x's
ability to resize the ring.

Are these latter two my main options?
