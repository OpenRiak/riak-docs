There is no way to do this directly. If you need joins (2, 3) or unions
(1), the easiest thing that you can do is use Riak Search/Yokozuna to feed
your MapReduce query instead of using a 2i input.

In response to your specific examples:

For #1 you could use an input where index1\_bin in range [1,30] and then
have the first map remove 11-21.

For #2 and #3 you could pick one of the conditions that you know to be the
more selective condition, use that as the MapReduce input and then use the
first MR phase to perform the other search.

But, as I mentioned in the first paragraph - Riak Search or Yokozuna seem
like a far more effective fit.
