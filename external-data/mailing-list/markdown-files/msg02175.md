Riak Recap for Jan. 31 - Feb. 1

1) Continuing with his blog series on Riak, David J. GÃ¶hrig wrote
another lengthy and informative post. This one is called "Varnish
Cache + Riak: Part II" and is certainly worth the read.

Thanks, David!

2) Jeremiah Peschka wrote a blog post all about Map/Reduce Key Filters.
