Gustavo - 

This is a feature we've definitely thought about. We have it on our roadmap of 
improvements but I can't say when this feature will appear in Riak. We are 
committed to making MapReduce more useful and usable for everyone and allowing 
external processes to participate in MapReduce jobs is a great way to achieve 
both of those goals.
