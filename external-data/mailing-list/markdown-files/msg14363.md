Test cluster with 2 machines running 1.4.8 with the memory backend. 
app\_config has ring\_creation\_size 64, max\_memory 4. If I understand the 
documentation correctly this should result in a maximum memory footprint 
(minus overhead) of 256M. Each node has 2G RAM, 2G of swap. After 
running for a while constantly adding data, without ever explicitly 
removing any, the memory footprint outstrips physical ram and will 
eventually consume all available swap space and be killed.


Is this a known issue in 1.4.8 that's fixed in 1.4.9, or is there other 
configuration settings that need adjusted to reduce the footprint?


Initially I had set it up to top out at 1GB but when it started 
exhausting swap, I progressively reduced max\_memory until I arrived 
where I am now, with no difference at all.
