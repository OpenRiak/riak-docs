Hi David,

Sorry about the hokey-cokey on this.

In 2.0 for allow\_mult=false as a default for default/untyped buckets. That is 
to support legacy applications, and rolling upgrades with the least surprise.
allow\_mult=true by default for typed buckets, as we think this is the correct 
way to run Riak, and there are no legacy typed buckets.

Information on Bucket Types can be found here 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0pre20/dev/advanced/bucket-types/

Cheers

Russell
