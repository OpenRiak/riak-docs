Hi everyone,

I'm new to Riak, and have been playing around with it the last few
days. The first thing I did to become familiar with Riak was to write
a benchmarking utility that uses node.js to write as many key/value
pairs as it can, as quick as it can. I'm using node\_riak
(https://github.com/mranney/node\_riak) for this, over the HTTP
interface.

Anyway, after I go just past 1,000 inserts, I start seeing errors like these:

riak response error too many pending requests, get
bucket\_key="test-benchmark/test\_1007"

And here is the JSON that I get back from Riak:

{ reason: 'full',
 delay: true,
 attempt:
 { options:
 { path: '/riak/test-benchmark/test\_1007',
 headers: [Object],
 retry\_not\_found: true,
 method: 'GET',
 retryDelay: 20,
 retryFilter: [Function],
 stream: false,
 success: false } },
 message: 'too many pending requests' }

This seems like too low a number to be having issues like this, so I'd
like to ask if there are any parameters I could check or change, or
any troubleshooting I can try?

Thanks,

-- Doug
