Hello everyone ,

I'm relatively new to riak and am just in the process of exploring things
I seem to have this recurring problem thats an on again ..off again thing ..

NOTE: This issue started after i tried setting up a mulit backend setup but
reverted back to this one for now

Everytime i start a riak node(i clear all the data in /var/lib/riak/) and
try to perform a basic curl insertion on it ..

curl -v -XPUT http://10.151.99.77:8087/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true 
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"bar":"baz"}'
(Taken from riaks tutorial)

The command just seems to halt or not return .. it has this message till the
point it halts

\* About to connect() to 10.151.99.77 port 8087 (#0)
\* Trying 10.151.93.77... connected
\* Connected to 10.151.93.77 (10.151.93.77) port 8087 (#0)
> PUT /riak/test/doc?returnbody=true HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.21.6 (x86\_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.21.6

> Host: 10.151.93.77:8087
> Accept: \*/\*
> Content-Type: application/json
> Content-Length: 13
my app.config is pretty basic with the exceptions .. - Changed port to 8087
- and i think this is default but the storage backend is {storage\_backend,
riak\_kv\_memory\_backend}

and the vm.args has custom name with the ip of 10.151.99.77 ...
What i really want to know ..
- is there some logs i can see for the curl commands ?
- is there something im missing in the app.config ?


-Thanks ! :)
