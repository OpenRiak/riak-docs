Is there anyone you know in Melbourne Australia who might be able to help us?

I'm sure all my issues are config related, and maybe exacerbated by the fact 
that I am setting up a single node and the docs seem often to assume you have 
more than one? So it gets confusing how it should be configured, just to get 
started with a single node.

Eek, that's no good. It appears that we should have better error handling for 
this.

My first thought is that the proxy is not configured for your Riak CS hostname 
in the riak-cs-control configuration file. Can you verify that the app.config 
contains the same proxy configuration as the app.config for your Riak CS 
installation?
