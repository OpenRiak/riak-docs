Hi,

I wanted to ask what are popular, scalable ID generation techniques for storing 
data in RIAK. Some ideas that we are toying with:

 1. ID Generation server (like Flikr ticket server) - Numeric
 2. Twitter's Snowflake like implementation- Alphanumeric
 3. Riak's auto ID generation- Alphanumeric

So far, we are thinking of going with option 2 as it doesn't require node 
coordination, k-sorted. But we would prefer a uncoordinated numeric Unique Ids.
