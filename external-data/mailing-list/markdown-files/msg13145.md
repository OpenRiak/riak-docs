Hi,
 I'm reading through the RiakCS documents about ACL, it said:
"Each bucket and object will have an ACL associated with it."
and
"An ACL can have up to 100 grants."
for me, it seems to means that there will only be up to 100 users to be
able to do operation against one bucket (while for a certain object, same
thing happen).

however, I did a test, creating thousands of users and call
"s3cmd setacl --acl-grant=read:[userid] s3://test-bucket/"
to grant these users "read" permission to bucket of "test-bucket".

the result of test veto what said in document, is there anything i missed?

Thanks.
Gavin
