Ok. Thanks. I'd be interested in seeing what's in the repo, if it is made 
public.


I'll also follow up with the obvious question: Are there any plans for an 
official one? The community for connectors is rich 
(https://www.confluent.io/product/connectors/), and the ability to shovel data 
into a scalable Kafka cluster, and have it land automatically in a scalable 
RiakTS cluster is pretty appealing...

Hi Joe,

Sorry for letting your question remain unanswered for so long. There
is indeed a tool you might find useful:
https://github.com/basho-labs/kafka-connect-riak, but please be aware
that it is provided with no official support from Basho.

Regards,
Andrei
