Hi,

When I run a curl -H "Accept: text/plain"
http://137.195.143.116:8098/statscommand
I get three sets of nodes:connected\_nodes, ring\_members, ring\_ownership
that are not the same. One node is included in connected\_nodes but is not
included in ring\_members, ring\_ownership
What could be the reason?

Thanks in advance,

Alek
