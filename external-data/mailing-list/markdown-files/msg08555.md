Hello Everybody,

We are currently alpha testing out our Webapp which uses Riak for storing
binary files (< 2 MB) with n\_val as 2. We currently have 3 nodes in the
cluster and all files are stored in the same bucket. We are using Bitcask
engine.

Sometimes we see 404 error cropping up when accessing these keys. This
happens only once in a day or so and all existing keys are accessible most
of the time. We are only trying to access the keys that we have put in
Riak so there is no doubt of their existence.

Can a network split cause such an error? Is there anything we can do to
avoid such corner cases.

Thank you

Praveen
