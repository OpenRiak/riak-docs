Hi everyone,
Despite seeing new components being added to Basho data solutions, which is
great (e.g. Riak TS) I wonder about Riak KV evolution.

Since 2013 there's no major release of Riak KV and not many features were
added since then. Is Riak KV still a priority to Basho?

Some features that I miss:

 - TTL per bucket or per key,
 - Secondary index in Bitcask or TTL in LevelDB.
 - Be able to drop an entire bucket.

Is there a Roadmap of Riak KV or a list of features coming?
