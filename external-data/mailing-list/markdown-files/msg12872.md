Riak Users,

Today I'm happy to announce the 0.11.0 release of Yokozuna.

This release brings Riak Java Client support as well as
authentication and security for the HTTP and protocol buffer
transports. An access control list (ACL) may be created to
control administration and access to indexes. All official Riak
clients should now have full support for Yokozuna's
administration and search API. Stored boolean fields and tagging
support were fixed for the protocol buffer transport. And
finally, documentation was added. The new CONCEPTS document [1]
goes over various important concepts in Yokozuna and the
RESOURCES document [2] has links to other resources for
learning. There isn't much documentation on specifically how to
use the new security features besides in the pull request itself
but I will rectify that soon with a security specific doc page.

This release may confuse some people given that the Riak 2.0 Tech
Preview (2.0.0pre5) [3] was just released last week. Why continue
with separate Yokozuna releases? What is the difference? These
questions are answered in the INSTALL document [4], but the short
story is that Yokozuna runs on a monthly release cycle and
therefore out paces official Riak releases. These monthly releases
allow you to try the latest Yokozuna features and bug fixes
without waiting for the next Riak release. These releases should
never be used for production. See the INSTALL document for more
information.

In summary: If you need to test the latest features then use the
Riak-Yokozuna source package. Otherwise just stick to the tech
preview until the final Riak 2.0 package drops.

Finally, the only feature in Riak-Yokozuna 0.11.0 not found in
Riak 2.0.0pre5 is the security feature. See the release notes and
install document for more details.
