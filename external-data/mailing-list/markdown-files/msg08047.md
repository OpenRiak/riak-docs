On a slightly related note, the next release of the Python client will
extract the Protocol Buffers messages into a separate package with an
explicit dependency on the 2.4.1 protobuf package. These are generated from
the same riak\_pb project from which we generate the Erlang code. You can
already download 2.6 and 2.7 eggs from PyPI:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=riak\_pb&version=1.2.0
