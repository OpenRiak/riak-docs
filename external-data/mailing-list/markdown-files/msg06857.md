Phil,
Its a pretty well known issue. If you don't mind an older version of the
riak client there is a folk on github that does support this
https://github.com/bretthoerner/riak-python-client/branches.
Your other option is to manage it in your app or subclass the transport
object.
Some people use haproxy. I'm not a fan of this approach in production,
since the load balancer is now the point of failure.
