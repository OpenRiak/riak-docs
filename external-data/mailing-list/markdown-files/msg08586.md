I discovered what the behavior change is and it was subtleâ€¦

Suppose you populated a value in the bucket:

 curl -X PUT http://localhost:8098/riak/test/foobar -d '{"foo":"bar"}'

In the 0.14.0 release if you did a curl -X DELETE 
http://localhost:8098/riak/test/foobar you could do:

 ObjectJSON = riak\_object:get\_value(Object),
 O = mochijson2:decode(ObjectJSON),

you would get ObjectJSON with the contents of the deleted object:

 ObjectJSON = <<"{"foo":"bar"}">>
 O = {struct,[{<<"foo">>,<<"bar">>}]}

In 1.2, if you did the same thing, however, you'd get the following:

 ObjectJSON = <<>>

And mochijson2:decode will blow up trying to decode the empty object

 \*\* exception error: no match of right hand side value any
 in function mochijson2:tokenize/2 (src/mochijson2.erl, line 556)
 in call from mochijson2:decode1/2 (src/mochijson2.erl, line 312)
 in call from mochijson2:json\_decode/2 (src/mochijson2.erl, line 
307)

So while the documentation is technically true, the behavior on the post-commit 
hook changed substantially in the case of DELETE.

In our hook's case, this change was very significant as we were inspecting the 
contents of the deleted object to update cache objects in other buckets.

It definitely makes life more difficult not knowing the contents of the deleted 
object :)
