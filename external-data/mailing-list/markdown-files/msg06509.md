Sorry, I misunderstood you. Yes, a range over the flavor index which you
know to include all flavors will work. You can also use the undocumented
$bucket feature to get all keys in a specific bucket, e.g.

http://localhost:8098/buckets/test/index/$bucket/$bucket

riakc\_pb\_socket:get\_index(Pid, <<"test">>, <<"$bucket">>, <<"$bucket">>)

This will traverse the minimal amount of data required to build the key
list. You still need to get the value (or just the metadata since that's
where indexes are kept) since this only gives you the keys. I would use
the query as input to map/reduce to build the distinct list.
