Hi,
I'm need to use faceting for some of the data in Riak, I know we can use it
with Search.Options, but I couldn't find a decent way to use that. I was
looking at any test cases, but couldn't find any. If some body used it, can
you please post a gist or sample here.

I just need to use enable facet and pass facet fields.

Thanks
Santi
