Hey riak-users,

I've just tagged and released version 1.5.2 of the Python client to
PyPi. This should likely be the last release of the 1.5.x series. It
includes some bugfixes and HTTPS support.

Release notes: 
https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/blob/1.5.2/RELEASE\_NOTES.md#152-patch-release---2013-01-31
Docs: http://basho.github.com/riak-python-client/
Issues: https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/issues

We're very excited about the following release of the client, which is
currently brewing on the master branch and includes multi-node
connections, streaming, and a bunch of other enhancements. Your
comments, suggestions, issues, and contributions are welcomed!
