Hi,

Can you describe your use case a little? Maybe it would be easier for us to 
help.

The real purpose of allow\_mult=true is so that writes are never dropped. In the 
case where your application concurrently writes to the same key on two 
different nodes, or on two partitioned nodes, Riak keeps both values. Other 
data stores will lose one of the writes based on timestamp, serialise your 
writes (slow) or simply refuse to accept one or more of them.

It is the job of the client to aggregate those multiple writes into a single 
value when it detects the conflict on read. Conflict resolution is required 
because your data is opaque to Riak. Riak doesn’t know that you’re storing 
lists of values, or JPEGs or JSON. It can’t possibly know how to resolve two 
conflicting values unless it knows the semantics of the values. Riak \_does\_ 
collect all the values written to a key, but it does so as a temporary measure, 
it expects your application to resolve them to a single value. How many are you 
writing per Key?

Riak’s sweetspot is highly write available applications. If you have the time 
read the Amazon Dynamo paper[1], as it explains the \_problems\_ Riak solves as 
well as the way in which it solves them. If you don’t have these problems, 
maybe Riak is not the right datastore for you. Solving these problems comes 
with some developer complexity costs. You’ve run into one of them. We have many 
customers who think the trade-off is worth it: that the high availability and 
low-latency makes up for having eventual consistency.

Sorry, but I don’t understand what you mean by this statement. The point of 
allow\_mult=true is so that writes are not arbitrarily dropped. It allows Riak 
nodes to continue to be available to take writes even if they can’t communicate 
with each other. Have a look at Kyle Kingsbury’s Jepsen[2] post on Riak.

Maybe. Or maybe just use the client as it is intended to resolve sibling values 
and send that value and a vector clock back to Riak. Or maybe roll your own 
indexes like in this blog post[3]. With Riak 2.0 there are a few data types 
added to Riak that are not opaque. Maybe Riak’s Sets would suit your purpose 
(depending on the size of your Set.)

There is a wealth of data modelling experience at Basho and on this list. The 
more information you give us about your problem, (rather than describing what 
you perceive to be Riak’s shortcomings), the more likely you are to be able to 
benefit from that experience.

You’re fighting the database at the moment, rather than working with it. The 
properties of Riak buy you some wonderful things (high availability, partition 
tolerance, low latency) but you have to want / need those properties, and then 
you have to accept that there is a data modelling / developer complexity price 
to pay. We don’t think that price is too high. We have many customers who 
agree. We’re always working to lower that price (see Strong Consistency, 
Yokozuna, Data Types etc in Riak 2.0[4].)

You seem to have had a very negative first experience of Riak (and Basho.) I 
think that is because you misunderstand what it is for and how it should be 
used. I'm very keen to fix that. If it turns out that Riak is just not for you, 
that is fine too.

In response to your earlier mail, I think Basho’s consulting costs sound 
incredibly low. I think you got that answer because you reached out to Basho 
through that channel, rather than ask the list. We’re still trying to track 
down who you spoke to and when, if you could provide me details of that 
conversation directly (rather than to the list) I’d be very grateful.

I’m not sure if it is just a cultural / language thing, but you’re very 
negative right now, and you sound like you're attacking Basho and Riak. I don’t 
think that is warranted at this point as we’re just trying to help you figure 
out if Riak is the datastore you want / need.

Cheers

Russell
