Conceptually I think it should work - the same PN counter design could
handle floats as well as integers. You'd have to make sure the P and N
values only grew by handling the sign - if you want to add a negative float
you would do N += abs(V). There are also concerns around error bounds and
all those kinds of things you deal with in floats. I'll risk stating the
obvious and say you could do fixed point stuff with the existing counters
if you multiply / divide by a scale factor on store/retrieval
