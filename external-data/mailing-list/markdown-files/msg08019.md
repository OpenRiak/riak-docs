Hi All, 

As one of the partners of United Partners, I'd filled out
the form on the Basho site and posted my request to join the Riak CS
Start-ups program about a week ago. Unfortunately I haven't received any
response....in the positive or otherwise. 

Given that my company
fulfills all the prerequisites listed in the documentation available on
the Basho site....and given that we expect to use riak cs for storing/
retrieving videos, I was hoping to get a response that would let me let
me finalize my technology stack. 

Would appreciate it if someone could
guide me on any special requirements that aren't listed on the Basho
site...OR....for that matter tell me the turn-around-time I should
expect for such a request to be fulfilled. 

United Partners
(http://www.united-partners.co.in) is a small start-up that provides
high-end technology consultancy for large scale transactions,
distributed, fault tolerant systems and is in the process of building a
couple of global products that could use riak cs. In our 4th month of
existence, we are self funded and use our services stream to fund our
product efforts. 

Regards, 

Raman
