Hi folks,

For your information: with the demise of Basho, we decided to fork 
basho/sidejob to be able to keep maintaining and updating it. Head to 
https://github.com/erlangpack/sidejob for an updated version. Also available on 
Hex.pm.

If any of the original maintainers on basho/sidejob is reading this: please let 
me know. Iâ€™d very much like to move the basho/sidejob repository in order to 
prevent confusion on where to head for issues and updates.

Cheers,

David\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
