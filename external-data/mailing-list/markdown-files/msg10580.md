hello,
would you have any cost comparison analysis document which looks at a
running a riak cluster versus mongodb sharded cluster, i am asking as
i have been tasked to compare the cost of infrastructure when the
volume of data is large. We are storing the information of our users
advertising campaigns
on a collection of about 30 million documents now, which would increase.
Each document is composed of elements that are arrays of objects (the
objects for a given elements have the same structure) We now have 6
elements that can be composed of 1 to many objects (up to 50-100)
Any advice much appreciated.
