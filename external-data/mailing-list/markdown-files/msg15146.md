I have a cluster of RHEL 6 test servers currently running 1.4.10. I'd like
to install 2.0.2 on these servers along side of 1.4.10, without building
from source. I need the ability to switch between both while testing our
application with the latest Riak. Both versions do not need to be running
at the same time. Is there a proven process for doing this?

Thanks!

Andrew
