>Riak contains its own implementation of a MapReduce API. This API is written 
in Erlang and C and shares no code with Hadoop. We have, on occasion, described 
our API as "Hadoop like" to help people understand the differences between our 
implementation and others. For example:
>
>\* CouchDB's MapReduce incrementally builds a BTree thru the execution of 
views. Riak doesn't cache or store MapReduce results. Each job executes "from 
scratch" and returns results to caller. It is up to the caller to cache or 
store these results if needed.
>
>\* Hadoop MapReduce jobs use HDFS or HDFS-adapted resources. Riak MapReduce 
jobs use data stored in a Riak cluster.
>
>\* Riak MapReduce jobs take advantage of their execution environment. Map 
functions exploit data locality. This means map functions are sent to the node 
hosting the required data rather than streaming the data to a central 
coordinating node. The most recent version of Riak also includes improvements 
which has significantly boosted the efficiency of mapping over entire buckets 
of data.
>
>\* Riak supports writing MapReduce functions in two languages: Erlang and 
Javascript. Erlang is the absolute fastest, in terms of raw speed, but 
Javascript runs a close second and is easier for most people to use.
>
>Depending on what your jobs are doing and which language, Erlang or 
Javascript, there are a few tunable parameters we can tweak to improve 
performance. More information about what your job is doing, how your cluster is 
set up, and the kinds of performance you're seeing would help us debug the 
situation.

>That should only be an issue if you are putting the source of the function 
directly in your query. Instead, try saving the function in a bucket/key and 
refer to it that way. Here's what a phase using bucket/key instead of source 
would look like:

extractSomeFields","keep":false}}

>You can use curl or any one of the the language-specific clients to store the 
function, just specify "application/javascript" as the content-type.
