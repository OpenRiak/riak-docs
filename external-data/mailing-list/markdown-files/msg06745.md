Got it. I was unsure how "If-Unmodified-Since" and "If-None-Match"
were implemented, but that makes sense given Riak's architecture.

I think a point of serialization is not needed here. It should be sufficient
to add a new internal API for nodes to handle a two-phase commit, and
then the transaction coordinator (running on whatever node you make
the request to) can contain the logic to carry out the transaction.

I totally understand that under the current architecture and exposed
API's of Riak KV it is not possible.
