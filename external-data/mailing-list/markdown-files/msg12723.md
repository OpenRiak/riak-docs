Hi,
I've been having some trouble getting the javascript vm in Riak to 
operate correctly on Date objects.


According to this, I should be able to create dates using an ISO8601 
date string, or a simplified YYYY-MM-DD format.


http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15

However in practice, this just results in "Invalid Date" errors.

Is this a known issue, or am I doing something wrong?

thanks,
Toby
