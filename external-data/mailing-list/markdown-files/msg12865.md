Hi all,

We have a brief network maintenance(~15 min) coming up for 1 node in our 5
node cluster. I was wondering if best practice is to just let the network
maintenance happen and let riak do the right thing or should we explicitly
stop riak on that node during the maintenance and start it back up once the
maintenance is complete.

Thanks,
Eric
