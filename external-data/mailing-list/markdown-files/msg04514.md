I never learned to 
read!

For performance metrics, you could see if there are any dtrace points for 
InnoDB. I wouldn't be able to tell you how to write them, but you'd want to 
look for things like page splits writes/second, file growth operations. That'll 
tell you what kind of storage operations are causing your performance slow 
down. There's an Oracle blog that looks like it contains some basics on writing 
this sort of thing: 
http://blogs.oracle.com/realneel/entry/inniostat\_innodb\_io\_statistics

The other obvious options to switch up are adding noatime to skip the file 
access time writes and switching innostore to use dynamic format tables to 
avoid the large write issues. I think InnoDB uses 16K pages by default, so 8K 
objects are going to leave a lot of empty space in the data file leading to 
increased I/O. The write performance on previously seen objects is probably 
coincidence because InnoDB doesn't have to grow the data files and isn't 
performing page splits.

With very sparse page population (large values), you're going to have to update 
a lot of data pages when you insert a single row since every leaf level page 
contains pointers to the next and previous page. Worst case scenario - writing 
a single record could lead to four updates - data page, intermediate page, and 
next and previous page. So, 8k of data could result in 32k of write. With a 16k 
data page, a 9k write becomes a 64k write because of updates to other pages. 

Also, if you can put the log files on separate disks than your data files (at 
least for this load process) then you'll get much better throughput (less I/O 
contention, etc blah blah blah DBA blah blah).
