As a complete new starter on riak, I wonder if someone could advise on what is 
the idiomatic way of using riak in the case of wanting to store a document 
together with some associated metadata (and wanting to retrieve the object 
based on metadata queries). Application-imposed link from the 'metadata' 
document to the key of the 'main' document? A parent child relationship? 
Thanks.
