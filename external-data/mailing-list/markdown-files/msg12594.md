Hi Daniel,

You mentioned this was running on three servers simultaneously. Is it
possible that two of the bucket property updates were truly concurrent? If
so, an implementation detail of bucket properties: they are last-write-wins
(and unfortunately the resolution is in milliseconds)\*. So its feasible
that in some cases the allow\_mult=false would win.

Cheers,
Jordan

\*this is something we plan to address in future releases.
