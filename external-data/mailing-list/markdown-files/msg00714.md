I believe the number of buckets are basically unlimited - as long as
you use the default bucket properties (which can be changed by conf
file), re. number of replicas. If you change bucket properties on the
fly that info runs around the cluster in the gossip channel.
Afaik, buckets are simply virtual namespaces. Your data structure
could have a bucket per user listing collections. Map over that then
use the collection value to deriv bucket/key pair to pass into
additional map phases in an m/r chain.

And no, I seriously doubt that riak traverses the entire key space for
every m/r in the sense that it touches every key in the system
regardless of bucket. That is why riak has an input param required for
each m/r. I would love to hear otherwise.
