Hi Erik,

We just added this to the develop branch two weeks ago and we'll be rolling
it out in a point release via NuGet. You'll need to cast your instance of
RiakObject to IWriteableVClock before you are able to set vector clocks:
https://github.com/DistributedNonsense/CorrugatedIron/blob/develop/CorrugatedIron.Tests/Models/RiakObjectTests.cs#L107

Not that \_you\_, Erik F Andersen, need to read the guidelines about writable
vector clocks, but future list readers, please be aware that messing about
with vector clocks may result in vclocks breaking into your house at night
and taking all your stuff. Read John Daily's excellent article
"Understanding Riak's Configurable Behaviors: Part 2"[1], just so you
understand what being able to set a vclock really means, how siblings may
arrive (protip: Tom Santero is not the stork), and all kinds of other
interesting things.

Also, list members who use Corrugated Iron (narrow subset, I know): please
submit GitHub issues for things that you want to see in the client. OJ and
I both work full time on other things and we implement features that either
we think are interesting and safe OR that you, the community, would like to
have.
