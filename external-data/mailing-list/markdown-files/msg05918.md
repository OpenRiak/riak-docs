I'm running a map/reduce operation with fairly complex map and reduce
phases against about 2000 keys. Each key also has a (fairly small)
payload arg. Currently just testing it locally against a single Riak
node. I've started consistently seeing this error during the reduce
phase:

error:{case\_clause,{error,timeout}} reducing:
(then a dump of a bunch of the data for the phase)

The map/reduce itself has a timeout of 10 minutes, but this is
happening after about 30 seconds. Any idea what could be causing this?

Thanks!
Mat
