Morning, Afternoon, Evening to all,

As you'll soon realize, this Recap is downright exceptional! We have
slides, more production users, blog posts, photos, new code, webinars
and enough quality Gists to last you a few days.

Enjoy, and have a great weekend.

Riak Recap for 9/15 - 9/16

1) Several days ago Justin Sheehy and Bryan Cantrill gave a webinar on
NoSQL DB performance in the cloud. This one is great and has some
illustrative benchmark numbers from some thorough testing of Riak
Smartmachines.

Listen and watch here --->

2) We added another user -- We Geo -- to the "Who is Using Riak Page"
on the Wiki.

Check it out here ---> http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Who+is+Using+Riak

Thanks to Ken, Jimmy, and the rest of the team at We Geo for sharing!

3) Artur Krzywanski wrote up a great overview of getting Riak running on EC2.

Post here --->http://www.krzywanski.net/archives/641

Thanks, Artur.

4) @sj\_mackenzie is working on an interesting chunk of code called
"Earlybrew." It's definitely worth checking out, especially if "you're
looking for cappuccino on the uptimes of Erlang/OTP, simplicity of
Webmachine and bomb proofness of Riak."

Repo here ---> http://bitbucket.org/sj\_mackenzie/earlybrew

5) Some photos surfaced from the August Riak Meetup in San Francisco.

Special thanks to Dave Fayram (@kirindave) for making this happen!

6) I added some new slides to the list available on the wiki. The deck
is called "Riak from the Inside" and was used at Erlang Factory some
months ago by Justin Sheehy. You're not going to want to miss these if
you haven't already seen them.

7) Q --- Is anyone using riak in production? (from jpartogi via #riak)

 A --- See http://www.basho.com/customers.html and
http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Who+is+Using+Riak

8) seancribbs and outerim had a long and content-filled conversation
in #riak that stared with "if allow\_mult is not set on a bucket what
happens with 2 conflicting writes?"

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/584539

9) jpartogi and seancribbs had a short exchange about whether or not
range queries were possible in Riak via MapReduce and whether or not
there were plans to make MapReduce built in to ripple rather than
calling the Riak client.

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/584548

11) danlarkin, seancribbs and hemulen had a convo about MapReduce
performance and how the number of nodes affects it for certain
queries.

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/584552

12) technoweenie asked "how can i simulate a riak version conflict to
test conflict resolution?"

Resulting conversation here ---> http://gist.github.com/584557

13) mheld started a great conversation about use cases and DB
functionality when he asked "Why would one use riak over mongodb?"

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/584572

14) seancribbs and jpartogi had a brief chat about indexing with a k/v
store and multitenancy in Riak.
