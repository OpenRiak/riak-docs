Hi Jay,

I'm not able to reproduce the behavior you are seeing. Here is what I am
doing to try to reproduce the issue:
1. Setup a 4 node cluster
2. Continuously write a new object to Riak every 0.5 second
3. Continuously read a known object (GET riak/test/1) from Riak every 0.5
second
4. Reboot one of the nodes

The reads and writes continue working normally when rebooting the node.

Do you see timeouts while writing objects to Riak?
Can you try reading other objects from Riak during the reboot (i.e.
different keys)?

Thanks,
Dan
