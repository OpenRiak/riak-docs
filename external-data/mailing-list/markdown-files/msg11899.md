Hope you all don't get pissed for me spamming the listâ€¦.;)

I upgraded my cluster to 1.4.1 in hopes the levelDB changes may help. The 
cluster is now up and running, however Riak Control is complaining:

The following nodes are currently incompatible with Riak Control:


I googled around and saw this had something to do with the RPC calls failing, 
but I can't find any logs on the server that give me a hint where to go next.

When I rebuilt from source, my rel directory was nuked, so I needed to 
regenerate my certs. Would this screw things up?

Thanks,

Paul
