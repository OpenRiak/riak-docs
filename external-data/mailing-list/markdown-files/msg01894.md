I'm working on a Java classloader that pulls class files from Riak instead of a 
JAR file. Right now, I'm working on the utility that loads the contents of a 
local JAR file into Riak. This works fine, but I thought I'd cross my fingers 
and see if I could list the keys in that bucket to get a list of the class 
files I just loaded. I got the following error:

> GET /riak/jt400.jar?keys=true HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.19.7 (universal-apple-darwin10.0) libcurl/7.19.7

\* Avoided giant realloc for header (max is 102400)!
\* Closing connection #0
curl: (27) Avoided giant realloc for header (max is 102400)!

Which I assume is because I have a lot of entries in this bucket.

Should I just not try to list the keys in this bucket and settle for checking 
for 404s?

Thanks!
