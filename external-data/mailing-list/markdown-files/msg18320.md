Hello,

Just finished viewing Mark Allen's excellent 2015 Riak Core presentation and 
have been reviewing his Udon code on GitHub.

https://github.com/mrallen1

Now I have two Micky-the-Dunce questions:

1. Assuming a web-based system similar to Udon on a cluster of five physical 
cores with data distributed across three virtual nodes, can one enter and 
access the data through any one of the five physical nodes?

In other words, can one put a load balancer in front of the five physical nodes 
to enter and access data regardless of where it's ultimately stored in the 
cluster?

2. Can KV functionality be relatively easily built on top of Udon--- providing 
storage of, say, Erlang terms as well as files?

Thanks to all,

LRP
