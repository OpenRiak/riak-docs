Hi Ryan

I'm running the cluster on 4 physical servers with many cores each so CPU is 
not a limitation. Regarding the storage, we use Sun Openstorage which essential 
means, that we are writing to a flashdisk. Besides, I tried to use memorybased 
filesystem for storage with non significant changes in performance (50% better 
or so), so I doubt, that IO is my challenge. 

But I have noted the ZFS tuning recommendations - that will come in handy when 
we go in larger roll out.

But - David Dawson pointed me in the right direction - my simple converter 
script did a "fetch record, write record, repeat" lifecycle and the bare 
roundtrip time was a killer.

I have not extended my little script to become multithreaded (each write to the 
cluster happens in a dedicated thread) and that very simple enhancement now 
gave me more then 200 writes/sec, so I believe that the bottleneck is in my 
script and not the RIAK cluster right now.

I have run out of time for today, but I will continue my experiments tomorrow 
and finetune my script more (read: make it more parallel and perhaps distribute 
it to more hosts).

Best regards,
Karsten
