Riak Users,

Today I'm happy to announce the 3rd pre-release of Yokozuna. It's light on
new features but has some good performance improvements and added
robustness. Here are the highlights:

\* Allow store/retrieval of schemas via HTTP.

\* Upgrade to Solr 4.1.0 and the latest Riak.

\* Improve write/index throughput by disabling Solr's "realtime get" and
switching from XML update to JSON.

\* Added robustness around AAE and default index creation.

\* Listen on 'solr//select' to more easily work with existing clients
out of the box.

To see all changes read the full release notes [1]. Like the last two
releases, an AMI has been made, see the EC2 doc for more info [2].

New for this release is the addition of a source package. I hope this
might encourage those who are scared off by the process of building from
git to give Riak/Yokozuna a try. These four steps below will produce a
ready-to-run node under 'rel/riak' [3].

wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/yzami/pkgs/src/riak-yokozuna-0.3.0-src.tar.gz
tar zxvf riak-yokozuna-0.3.0-src.tar.gz
cd riak-yokozuna-0.3.0-src
make stage
