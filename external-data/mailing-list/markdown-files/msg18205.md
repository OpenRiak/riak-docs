Hi Prakash,

Please have a look at the documentation of Riak's stats module [0]. In
addition, as a general rule, Riak's data disk should never get more than
about 80% full (assuming it holds only Riak data), as additional disk space
may be needed when fallback partitions are created when another node is
down. Rather than looking at point in time values as reported by
`riak-admin status` and the HTTP `stats` endpoint, it is often more
valuable to graph the development of the reported statistics over time. Of
particular interest are the GET and PUT times reported (both node and
vnode), as these will show the latencies of the cluster when returning
results.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
