Use “max\_size” to set a limit on how many results you receive, as documented 
here:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/2i/#Querying

pass the parameter “stream=true” to stream.

Do you want the object bodies back too? There is a super secret interface in PB 
to achieve this, have a look at 
https://github.com/basho/riak-erlang-client/blob/master/src/riakc\_pb\_socket.erl#L1111.
 It at least illustrates the use of the query parameters for a $bucket index 
that uses streaming, pagination, etc
