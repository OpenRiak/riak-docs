Hi,

We are currently testing Riak as potential replacement for data
warehouse. Programmers was pretty happy with single-node operations, but
as we switched to testing of a cluster, performance of same applications
dropped significantly with only changes in code:

Configuration conf = new
PBClientConfig.Builder().WithHost("192.168.149.21").WithPort(8087).build
();

IRiakClient client = RiakFactory.newClient(conf);

 

to

 

PBClusterConfig clusterConfig = new PBClusterConfig(20);

PBClientConfig clientConfig = PBClientConfig.defaults();

clusterConfig.addHosts(clientConfig, "192.168.\*.\*","192.168.\*.\*");

IRiakClient client = RiakFactory.newClient(clusterConfig);

 

In the same time, I'm noticed, that if I use riak-admin status |grep
node\* - node\_gets\_total and node\_puts\_total rises only on one of the
clustered machines. 

Is there any way to monitor data distribution, activity and resources of
nodes in cluster? I saw multiple applications, but usually they provide
only bucket operations and status.
