My company have customers with hardware and software they already invest
money in. Like Windows, HP-UX, Solaris and RHELinux.
We are prototyping a new system with the scalability as major clue. We've
decided to use Erlang and want to try RIAK. But we have to support HW our
customers have.

I'm very-very newb to RIAK for now. I've stuck to the 45-min intro page on
the Basho site: being unable to just create a three-node cluster :) So I
don't know the structure and components of the RIAK. Are LevelDB and
Bitcask stay as options and it can be configured to use smth. different
pluggable to the library interface (internal RIAK API for K/V storage
library or smth. like that). It's also why I'm confused with "File access,
io scheduling and the like..." -- were there any interfaces used in
developing to whom the-new-windows library can conform to?

With all the respect,
Aleksandr
