Hi Nate,

Thank you for your feedback, this is good stuff. Some follow up questions
inline below:

Can you elaborate on this? Trying to think of a problem where it helps to
have the results ordered by node but not necessarily overall, and drawing a
blank.

Pagination is one clear case where this would be useful. Are you facing any
other scenarios where this is necessary?

Also, are you always looking for top X results, where X is known before the
query starts? Or does X change depending on the results?

Thanks!
Rusty
