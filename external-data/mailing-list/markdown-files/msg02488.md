Ack. I know what's happening with this. Riaksearch is sorting by
relevance, segmenting the results according to start and rows, and THEN
sorting by the sort key.

Is this the intended behavior? If so, I am kind of surprised because the
post sort is easy for the caller to do without Riaksearch's help. What's
hard is the pre-sort.

I suppose the work around is to get all of the results, then send the result
to map/reduce to correctly handle pre-sort, then filter by range. However,
before I do this, does anyone know if (a) this is considered broken? and (b)
if so, is this scheduled to be fixed?

Thanks,
