mochijson2 is what I tell anyone who asks to use. Representing strings as 
binaries avoids a whole host of data mangling problems when you have to deal 
with non-ASCII or non- ISO-8859 character sets. Strings as binaries also frees 
up lists to be interpreted as JSON arrays. This simplifies the data 
representation since the only annotation you have to provide is on hashes aka 
structs:

{struct, [{username, <<"jdoe">>}, {first\_name, <<"John">>}, {last\_name, 
<<"Doe">>}]}

translates to:

{"username": "jdoe",
 "first\_name": "John",
 "last\_name": "Doe"}

mochijson requires, if I remember correctly, annotations for both arrays and 
structs which is more "noisy" when you're doing lots of encoding and decoding.
