Hello all,

I'm storing a log of events in Riak. The key is an UUID plus number of
seconds since a video stream started. The value is an array of JSON
documents, such as this:


[{"viewer\_id\_s"=>"004615eb-5c0e-4c4a-890c-c6fc29e3fc56",
> "video\_time\_i"=>475, "type\_s"=>"joined"},
> {"viewer\_id\_s"=>"635dcd2d-fdeb-46c1-9920-803ccdd6176b",
> "video\_time\_i"=>522, "type\_s"=>"joined"},
> {"viewer\_id\_s"=>"04b3cec7-6f37-4840-b1b6-eff4c16dd273",
> "video\_time\_i"=>159, "type\_s"=>"joined"},
> {"viewer\_id\_s"=>"6ce3da5f-b598-4b1c-abf0-38ba92fa15fb",
> "video\_time\_i"=>393, "type\_s"=>"upvote"}]
>

My question to you is how can I search this array of documents through
Yokozuna/Solr? Currently, I get 0 results back, which I suspect is because
the actual JSON data is nested in an array and Yokozuna doesn't index that
in an expected way.

Thanks,

Srdjan
