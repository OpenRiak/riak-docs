Hello Riakators!

Welcome back to The Recap. It's time to review updates from the community.

## Community as Code
\* There has been a lot of activity inside The Riak Community
repository [1]. Most notably, we have an updated configuration
management strategy for those into Ansible, Puppet & Chef code [2]. A
huge thanks is due to all maintainers of these repos, especially Seth
Thomas [3] and Daniel Dreier [4] for their efforts.

## Recently answered
\* When using riak\_search, there's a known error experienced by Jason
[5] that is due to be patched at next release
\* As expected with large files, Bora found that Riak can 503 when
objects are in the 5-15MB range [6]
\* A long conversation on AAE and riak\_search starts here [7] and ends
here [8] with a conversation of tuning of solr indexing and jvm heap
memory
\* Zeeshan points to updating search.solr.jvm\_options for handling an
OutOfMemoryErrors issue [10]
\* Zeeshan helps again as Roma finds a way to fix his solr query issue [11]
\* Shino resolved a Riak CS error [12] by updating the aws-sdk [13] <<
Awesome work!
\* Dmitri offers a detailed reply to understanding Riak configuration [14]
\* Sargun helps understand the basics of basho\_bench and its
requirement for a cookie [15]

## Feedback Results
Last week I put a survey out on whether to write The Recaps in
markdown or plaintext. With 19 responses out of the ~1500 subscribers,
the results are not enough to justify shifting to a markdown mailing
service. Thank you to those who spoke up, especially Christopher for
his reference to this [11].
