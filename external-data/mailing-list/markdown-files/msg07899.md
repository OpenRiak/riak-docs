Venkatesh,

You can pass them just as you would with any other map function, using the
'arg' parameter. Here's a PHP example:

$mr->map(array("mybucket", "myfunction"), array("language" => "javascript",
"arg" => "the extra argument to your JS function"))

Just replace the RHS of the "arg" key with whatever data you want, as long
as it can be converted into JSON. That data will be passed as the third
argument to your function if it's a map, or the second argument if it's a
reduce.
