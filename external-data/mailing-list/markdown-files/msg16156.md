Hi Toby,

I am actually working on a rewrite of the Galaxy role that we used to have
up there to be simpler and support all of the 2.x features of Riak. You can
access it here: https://github.com/basho-labs/ansible-riak/tree/dev-2.x

I would greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions as well as any
contributions you may have from your testing on Ubuntu / Debian, since I am
using it with CentOS7 and may not have time to test it with Ubuntu for a
little while still.

Chris
