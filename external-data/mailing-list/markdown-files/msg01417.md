Hi Ross,

The comments in the app.config file should not prevent Riak from binding to
the web ip/port. As long as the parameter "web\_ip" and "web\_port" are
defined in the "riak\_core" section of that file Riak should bind to the
specified ip/port. By default Riak will bind to "127.0.0.1" on port 8098.

Did you download the latest release (0.13)?
Can you provide the original and modified config files?

Thanks,
Dan
