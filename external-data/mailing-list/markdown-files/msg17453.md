Hi, Luke.

Thank you for your answer. I did not understand you completely about
transfer-limit. How does it relate to my problem. Transfer limit - is a
limit of concurrent data transfer from different nodes. Am I wright? You
mean that riak can handoff one partition from several nodes concurrently?

Now I have transfer-limit 1 on all riak nodes.

But I am not sure that my cluster will be converged ever. All nodes
experiences low memory and are killed by OOM Killer periodically. I try to
add new nodes to the cluster but due problem with OOM killer this process
is very-very slow.

In the official docs I've read:

"Sibling explosion occurs when an object rapidly collects siblings that are
not reconciled. This can lead to a variety of problems, including degraded
performance, especially if many objects in a cluster suffer from siblings
explosion. At the extreme, having an enormous object in a node can cause
reads of that object to crash the entire node. Other issues include undue
latency
 and
out-of-memory errors."

I mentioned that new nodes in the cluster do not experience such problems
(I mean out of RAM).

Regarding to siblings maybe your are right, this is manifest object. I can
recognize key name but not bucket name. But more than 100 siblings on many
keys is really confused me. Each time I try to PUT some object to Riak via
Riak CS S3 interface I got errors with siblings.
