 Hi, 

Somewhere along the line, it looks like the mechanism for setting a custom 
extractor changed slightly. The documentation now says to set a property called 
search\_extractor with the fields mod, fun and arg.

It used to be a property called rs\_extractfun with the fields language, 
function and module.

The old rs\_extractfun syntax still seems to work with 1.0, but I'm wondering if 
I should switch over the new style to stay compatible with future releases. 
This also brings up an interesting question - how do I unset a bucket property?
