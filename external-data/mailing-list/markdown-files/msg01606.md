Are there any restrictions, incompatibilities between versions which
could break a rolling upgrade?

For example, I am still running 0.10 + innostore on a 3 nodes cluster
and I would like to upgrade to 0.13. What would be my best upgrade
option? do a rolling upgrade directly from 0.10 to .13 or do it
incrementally for all versions between 0.10 and 0.13?

For me a rolling upgrade would be best but I could manage a few hours
downtime for a faster and/or easier process by taking the cluster down
for the upgrade. Like Mark, performing a backup/restore is not really
an option.

Any recommendations?

(David Smith gave me some hints about the compatibility of 0.10 vs
0.13 
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2010-November/002435.html
but this is mostly a "it \_should\_ work" which is rather vague)

The upgrade process documentation between versions should definitely
be improved.

Thanks,
Colin
