The next release candidate has been built and uploaded to our Downloads page 
listed below. The RELEASE-NOTES at the link below has also been updated with 
the latest fixes.

Lastly, we are tentatively planning on releasing Riak 1.1 the week of February 
20th, so if you have some particular test cases you want to run before we cut 
the final release, now is your chance!

Thanks,
Jared
