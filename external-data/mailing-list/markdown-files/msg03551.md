Hi all,

I have a client which uses both the REST and PBC interfaces to Riak. When
this client makes calls, I want to make sure that the same client ID is used
for both of these interfaces. If I have an array of bytes which represents
the PBC version of the client ID, is the REST version of this client ID
(that goes into the X-Riak-ClientId header) just that same array of bytes
base64 encoded? If not, how do I correctly set the header so that the client
IDs match?

Thanks for the help.

Cheers
OJ
