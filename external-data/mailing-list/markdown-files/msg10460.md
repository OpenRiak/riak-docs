Hi all,

I just wanted to follow up point #10 with a small update. There seems to be
a bigger interest among .NET people in Brisbane, so the Azure meetup group
is now pairing up with the Queensland MSDN UG to host the event on the 10th
of April instead of the 20th March.

Updated details here for those interested:

Thanks John for the mention.
OJ
