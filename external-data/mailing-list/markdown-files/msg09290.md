this is funny but recently I started to think again about how riak works
and I thought I know more or less the basics ;]

but I start digging and again I read
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Tunable-CAP-Controls-in-Riak/and
then made few tests with riak bucket configured as follows

N = 3
W = 3

I have 2 nodes running in my cluster so far (only 2 are connected) for test
and I can still write with hinted handoff. I updated the data and I wrote
again with same key - I got success.

I changed properties on per request basis and I set w=1 I stopped first
node (so I had only one running) and put new key and value. I started first
node and query for the key and I got data from both nodes. I did the same
with new key again this time with w=3. and again it was successful.

what is the real difference between N and W. if hinted handoff always save
data for later synchronisation can write ever fail. are there any
differences between first write and later updates.

I hope it is not really stupid question
