Hi, 

In the last weeks we are experimenting a bad behaviour in our riak cluster, the 
bitcask backend is creating .write.lock files and it is related to bad 
behaviours when we are accesing to data, for example mapreduce, links or even 
write, update or get data from/to cluster.

The solution that we found is delete all .lock files, but we know if there any 
option to prevent this or if this is a issue on riak?

We use riak version 1.2.1 and we check the logs but we don't get any info about 
this problem.

Any ideas?

Thanks

Jorge Garrido
