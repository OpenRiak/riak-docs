We are using pre11 right now.

When we open http connections, they hang around for a long time in
CLOSE\_WAIT which results in really spiky performance. When the connections
close, its fast, then they build up again,

Is there something that needs to be configured w/ riak to get it to reuse
the sockets and not sit in close wait?
