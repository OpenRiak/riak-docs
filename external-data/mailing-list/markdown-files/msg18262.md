It’s really up to you. It makes sense if you have multiple separate units of 
work to have multiple vnodes. RiakKV (the database) has vnodes for 
reading/writing data, and other vnodes (riak\_pipe vnodes) for map/reduce, for 
example. If you look at Ryan Zezeski’s seminal and still relevant TryTryTry 
blog series, you’ll see it has different vnodes for different tasks 
(https://github.com/rzezeski/try-try-try.)

Cheers

Russell
