Hello

I’m trying to create a cluster from backups, as per:

https://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/using/cluster-operations/backing-up/
https://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/using/cluster-operations/changing-cluster-info/#clusters-from-backups

I’ve backup-up:

Bitcask /var/lib/riak/bitcask
Ring /var/lib/riak/ring
Configuration /etc/riak
Cluster Metadata /var/lib/riak/cluster\_meta
Search /var/lib/riak/yz

Do I need the ‘cluster\_meta’ folder?

Thanks

Mark
