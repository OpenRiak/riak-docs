The ring size constrains the parallelism for certain operations, such as 
MapReduce. Link walking is turned into a map phase internally. A small ring 
size can cause a stampede effect as many bucket/key pairs get hashed to the 
same vnode. 64 is a decent ring size but I'd personally opt for a larger ring 
size in the 128 or 256 range. The reason for this is a) it spreads out 
bucket/key pairs around the cluster in the case of large #'s of documents and 
b) provides room to expand the cluster in the future. Unfortunately, changing 
the ring size is fairly invasive and would require a data reload.

However, your overall performance seems slow to me. Do these timings reflect 
connecting via the load balancer? If so, could you re-run the write and link 
walk timings connecting directly to the cluster? It would also be good to know 
what the system metrics (load, memory usage, etc) on the nodes look like during 
the test.
