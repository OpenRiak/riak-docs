Yes, 'riak-admin join' is designed to join a node to a cluster, not a
cluster to another cluster. This behavior was different before Riak
1.0 (last September), but was changed as part of several changes to
make Riak's clustering layer more deterministic.

The short answer to the "why is this the case" is related to the fact
that Riak is a network-partition tolerant distributed database without
central coordination. If you have two separate clusters, both which
are receiving incoming client requests, and you try to join the two
clusters together during a network partition, there are very few
guarantees on deterministic behavior.

If clients can talk to all nodes in both clusters, but only some
subset of nodes in each cluster can talk to each other, you then end
up having clients talking to different nodes that have different
beliefs on what the cluster membership/topology is. This is even worse
if you have three clusters, and you concurrently issue a join between
1 and 2 and 2 and 3 during a similar partition scenario.

The more specific answer is that Riak provides certain guarantees by
ensuring that cluster changes logically appear to be totally ordered
events. The history of two completely independent clusters are
disjoint and cannot always be merged. This is solved for the single
node case by relaxing the constraint on total ordering. The cluster
you are joining still maintains a logically monotonic history. While
the node joining the cluster simply gives up it's history.
Specifically, the joining node asks the larger cluster for its cluster
information, and then atomically overwrites it's own view with that of
the cluster.

Joe
