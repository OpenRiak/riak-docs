Hello,

I'm currently using the Riak Erlang client and when I do a get\_index I
only get the keys back. So, my question is, is it better to get the
keys, loop through them and run a get on them one by one, or is it
better to write my own MapRed job which queries the index and then
runs a map phase using the function map\_object\_value. I remember
reading somewhere that you're better off running gets on multiple keys
vs using a MapRed job, but is this still the case for this use case
and with Riak 1.0?

Thanks,

Andrew
