Hi,

My servers complain about a leaky apache DateUtils class during hot
deployments. This is a known
bugin http
4.1.x and has been fixed in 4.2.x. Can the next version of
riak-client be updated to include the newer HTTP client (the
current version is 4.1.1 ) ? Is the riak-client compatible with httpclient
4.2.x as it is ?

Thanks
Deepak Bala
