Greetings...

I started removing a few nodes from a cluster today, and started to
get a lot of the following errors in the logs:

@riak\_api\_pb\_server:handle\_info:331 Unrecognized message

Message is either '{,ok}' or '{,{error,timeout}}'

We're running Riak 2.0 on Erlang R16B02-basho5, both built from
source. A quick Google hinted that it may be a regression of
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/366
