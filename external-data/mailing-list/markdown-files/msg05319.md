Hi Lyes,

There is currently no way to paginate from the command line. One workaround
is to use curl to access the solr interface. (
http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Querying.html#Querying-via-the-Solr-Interface)
Also, this has been mentioned before, but you should know that there is a
bug that affects Riak Search pagination when used in combination with
sorting: https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=867

There is no built in way to calculate snippets from search results. I'd
recommend that you feed the search results into a Map/Reduce job and extract
the snippet using a regular expression.

Best,
Rusty
