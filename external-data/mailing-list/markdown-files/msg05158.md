Hal,

I would be interested to see what the format of the object is after it has
passed through your precommit hook. We recently fixed some bugs related to
the JSON format of riak\_objects that might result in an unclean round-trip
through the JavaScript VM. That is, the format coming out is not the same as
went in.

Could you do the first step (store a new object through your precommit
hook), and then fetch it by attaching to the console? Here's what you can
do on the console:

1> {ok, C} = riak:local\_client().
2> rp(C:get(<<"bucket">>,<<"key">>)).

Of course, replace "bucket" and "key" as appropriate for your object.
