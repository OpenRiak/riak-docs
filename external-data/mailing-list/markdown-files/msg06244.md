Sreejith,

Some queries that include less-than/greater-than can also be expressed as
ranges. Your example is simple because someone's age cannot be < 0, so age
< 28 is equivalent 0 <= age <= 27, that is, age ranging from 0 to 27.

Yes, currently 2i only works with LevelDB. Theoretically other backends can
support it, but the feature has not been implemented on them yet.
