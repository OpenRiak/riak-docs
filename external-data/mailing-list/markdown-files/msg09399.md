Venki,

Regarding your original question about size of individual buckets/keys
within that data directory -- that cannot be done without directly
manipulating the storage engine or other components of Riak. One of the
benefits of Riak's consistent hashing is that you get a really even spread
among nodes and you don't really know (without digging into the Erlang
console) where specific keys live. That said, we have done it for customers
who have had specific production issues related to large keys, but this is
not something we recommend doing in general.
