Since you're on 1.4, could you please run "riak-debug" on every node
in your cluster? Please mail me directly and we'll come up with a way
to get them delivered.

Could you please also provide a description of the cluster's typical
workload? Any monitoring graphs or other statistics would be helpful.
Also, please provide a complete description of the hardware being used
- RAM, disks and disk type (spinning, SSD), operating system, etc.

Thanks.
