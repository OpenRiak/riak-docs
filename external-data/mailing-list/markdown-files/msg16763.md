Hello.

I'm new using Riak and Riak-cs, I have installed a Riak-cs cluster with 4
nodes and it works fine,

Here is my question, the company where I work has some buckets in Amazon
s3, and I would like migrate objects from these buckets to our Riak-cs
installation, as far as I know I can do it using S3FUSE or S3BACKER,
mounting buckets as a filesystem, but would like avoid mount it as
filesystem. I tried it with boto python library, using the copy\_key method,
but it doesn't work.

Has anybody try with success synchronize buckets from AS3 to Riak-CS?

Thanks.

P:D: Excuse for my English.
