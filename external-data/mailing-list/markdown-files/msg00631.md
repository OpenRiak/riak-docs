Does Riak have an HTTP API doc ( similar to the CouchDB one found
here: http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP\_Document\_API )?

The closest thing I can find is the Riak Fast Track (
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/The+Riak+Fast+Track ). But that
is in curl only rather than explicit HTTP headers.

In particular, I have a problem with the PUT request in the following
curl command

$ curl -v -X PUT -d '{"bar":"baz"}' -H "Content-Type:
application/json" -H "X-Riak-Vclock:
a85hYGBgzGDKBVIszMk55zKYEhnzWBlKIniO8mUBAA=="
http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true

I try to convert the command into HTTP headers but the request fails
when the followin is attempted :

a) include {"bar":"baz"} in the body and set the Content-Type header
to application/json
b) same as a) but add another Content-Type header value - this time
of application/x-www-form-urlencoded ( inspired by the info on the
-d command found in the following curl manual
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html )
c) same as b) but instead of placing {"bar":"baz"} in the body, add
ampersand in the url and bar=baz
http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true&bar=baz

I tried looking for an equivalent to the Live HTTP Headers extension
on Firefox but which would capture activity from curl commands. Then,
I could get a better idea of how to formulate the HTTP headers.

Please Help...

if there is an HTTP API doc with explicity header request info

how to formulate this particular PUT request with the HTTP headers

good ubuntu linux utility for capturing http activity even if not from
browser application
