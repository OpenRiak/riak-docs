Everyone,

https://github.com/rzezeski/try-try-try/tree/master/2011/riak-core-the-vnode

Here's my latest on Riak Core. A post about implementing a vnode. It comes
complete with a working application to parse incoming access log entires,
generate statistics, and query in real time. Let me know about the
confusing parts so I can fix them. Next up I plan to talk about building a
coordinator.
