Hi,

I cloned a ripple object and change the state of it. Unfortunately it
also change to state of the original object. How is this possible? Am
I doing something wrong? Here is the spec to show the example:

class Person
 include Ripple::Document

 property :name, String
end

class Dude
 attr\_accessor :name
end

describe 'test' do
 it "should copy object" do
 joe = Person.new
 joe.name = 'Joe'

 john = joe.clone
 john.name = 'John'

 joe.name.should == 'Joe'
 john.name.should == 'John'

 joe = Dude.new
 joe.name = 'Joe'

 john = joe.clone
 john.name = 'John'

 joe.name.should == 'Joe'
 john.name.should == 'John'

 end
end

The spec will fail when asserting Joe's (Person) name. Please advise
on how I can resolve this problem.

Thank you for your assistance.

Kind regards,
Joshua.
