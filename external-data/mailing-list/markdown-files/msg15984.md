Hello everyone! 

I am new using Riak 2.0. I am trying to put some hooks to my buckets but every 
time that I add the path to my advanced.config file, and restart, it doesn't 
work :(

Any help? I am following the documentation of Basho but nothing.

Anyone can send an example of the right configuration?

Thanks in advance,
