Riak Recap for February 24 - 26
========================

1) The team at Temetra wrote up a short blog post about how and why
they are using Riak in production.

with the Python client.

4) Basho Hacker Sean Cribbs was on the Extroverted Developer Podcast
talking about all things Basho, Riak and development.

5) Basho put up another Billboard. This one is to congratulate Bump on
passing 80MM users. If you're driving up the 101 just south of San
Francisco, you might see it. (Also, congrats to the Bump team for the
release of 3.0!)

6) We are doing a free Webinar on Wednesday all about what's new in Riak 1.1.

\* Details and RSVP here ---> http://basho.com/contact/webinar-registration

7) Jon Bribin released a Groovy DSL for doing HTTP testing that (as
far as I can tell) he's using for Riak development.

8) Basho team member Casey Rosenthal is going to be at the PDX Erlang
Meetup tomorrow night. I heard a rumor he has some Riak swag. Don't be
scared to attend and ask him hard questions.

\* Details here ---> http://calagator.org/events/1250461948

9) Erlang Factory San Francisco is just under a month away, so it's
about time to start talking about it. Basho will be represented in a
huge way. Talks are below. If you're going, get in touch with me so we
can plan to have beers and talk about software. If you're not going,
register, then get in touch with me so we can plan to have beers and
talk about software.
