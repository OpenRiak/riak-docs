CorrugatedIron v1.4.1 has been released. This is a minor release and is
mainly an enhancement to bucket options, plus the ability to delete based
on a RiakObject.

Download from nuget [1] or build from source [2]

## Release notes for v1.4.1

\* Support added to bucket properties for Replication Mode
(#132
)
\* Support added to bucket properties for `big\_vclock` and `little\_vclock` (
#131 )
\* `IRiakClient.Delete` accepts a RiakObject
(#158)
- it's now possible to pass in a full RiakObject and have CorrugatedIron
generate the correct RiakObjectId for deletion
