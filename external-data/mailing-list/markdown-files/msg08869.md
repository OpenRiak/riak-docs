Hi Tom,

With Riak, you load your data by primary key. Just like you have to specify a 
PK for a row with Cassandra or an RDBMS, you specify one with Riak. Riak 
"knows" all those values belong to the PK because you store them as an opaque 
blob within Riak. 

Using curl, loading your object would look like:

curl -v -XPUT -d '{ "name": “Gunther Boss”, "date of birth" : “1/1/1980”, 
"postal code" : "12345", "customer type" : "retail" "date became customer" : 
"1/1/2005", "purchase frequency" : "5"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/customer/123

Instead of timestamps, Riak creates a vector clock. This helps you determine 
object lineage as opposed to the time something was last saved. 

I suggest running through the Riak FastTrack[1]. It takes about 45 - 90 
minutes, but it'll give you a great overview of the concepts behind Riak and 
how you can use them to kick ass.
