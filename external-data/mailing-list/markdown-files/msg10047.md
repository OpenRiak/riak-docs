I was looking at CorrugatedIrons website and I see code like:

var query = new RiakMapReduceQuery()
 .Inputs("BucketName")
 .MapJs(m => m.Source(@"function(o){return[1];}"))
 .ReduceJs(m => m.Name(@"Riak.reduceSum").Keep(true));

I am assuming that functions like "Riak.reduceSum" are general utility 
functions that are part of the Riak distro. Is there a list of these 
somewhere documenting their use and purpose? There seems to be both 
JavaScript and Erlang methods. I would be interested in both. Thank you.
