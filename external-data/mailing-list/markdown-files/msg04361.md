I'd also be willing to help out with this. We've been running Riak on FreeBSD 
in production since the 0.12 release. I had put together some instructions 
here:

http://blog.harperdog.com/2010/12/17/riak-on-freebsd/

It's a bit outdated but it's still the process we use here. I could re-write 
it to be a bit more "wiki-ish".

Andrew is right, bash isn't a requirement anymore so that's something I would 
also change. Also, we have had trouble with R14 and have continued to use 
R13...but that's a challenge I could take on again.
