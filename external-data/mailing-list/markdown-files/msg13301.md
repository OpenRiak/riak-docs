Hi Hector,

I figured out the root issue this morning. I am using ubuntu 12.10 via
vagrant on windows. I installed Riak on the default shared folder as an
admin so installation, including symlinks, was successful. But for some
reason, running Riak from this shared folder results in all the
errors/issues I've been having. I re-installed Riak to the vm home folder
and everything (so far) works as expected. Thanks for working with me
through this odd problem.

Best,
Ari
