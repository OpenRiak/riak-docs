 I get this error on a seemingly random basis, with a one-node cluster
accessed locally over the default HTTP port (via riak-js).

It was so persistent that I have been taking the (probably needed
anyway) step of adding retry logic to every single call, which seems to
have solved the issues for me at any rate.
