I've just done a backup and restore of our production Riak cluster, and 
Yokozuna has dropped from around 125 million records to 25million. Obviously 
the IPs have changed, and although the Riak cluster is stable, I'm not sure 
Solr handled the transition as nicely.

Is there a way to force Solr to rebuild the indexes, or at least get back to 
the state it was in before the backup?

Also, is this expected behaviour?

Thanks,
Jason
