So we've been encountering some input that has json which is parsed
just fine by ruby but causes riak map reduce to die a horrible death.

Running Riak 0.14.2 with json2.js updated to the latest from github
(thanks for that suggestion Dan)

Steps to reproduce:

bin/riak attach

{ok, C} = riak:local\_client().
RObj = riak\_object:new(<<"badutf">>, <<"badutf">>, Badstuff).
C:put(RObj).


Ripple console:

 badutf = Riak::MapReduce.new(Ripple.client).add('badutf').map("function(v){
return [JSON.parse(v.values[0])]; }", :keep => true).run

This kills riak in a very bad way, have to shut it down, delete the
mr\_queue, then restart. Then the bucket is off limits until you find
the offending key and delete it (which is very hard to do if you can't
run a map).


Any ideas?

Thanks,
Sylvain
