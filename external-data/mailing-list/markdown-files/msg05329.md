Hi Guys,

I'm trying to learn Riak using padrino + ripple and for that I created a
padrino project with one Customer model using the Ripple::Document model and
start playing around in the padrino console. The project setup seems to be
ok since I can create and save instance objects from padrino console however
whenever I call Customer.all I got a method undefined error.

Am I doing something wrong here? Is there another way to retrieve all
documents within a bucket?

Thanks in advance,

Eric
