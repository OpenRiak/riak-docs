This is almost exactly what we do with our riak clusters (as well as actually
all our subclusters). It's actually nice for developer because when they
need to talk to a network service they just reference 127.0.0.1 and some
port, and haproxy gets them to the right place. This also allows an
operations team to make network changes without impacting applications
(via the use of the haproxy reload).

The only downside is that if your connections are long lived and you restart
your riak nodes, all requests will end up on the last node. And if you restart
haproxy they will all end up on the first node initially. I sort of wish
there was a configuration parameter to haproxy to randomize the start
point for the roundrobin so you could keep things a little more balanced
across many machines running haproxy.
