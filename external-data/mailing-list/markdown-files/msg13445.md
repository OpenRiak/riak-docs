Hi,

I would like use riak as a key/value store only so what it differs with
respect to redis and why should i go with riak instead of redis? many
people say riak but i don't see any clear difference why riak over redis.
Even redis can do the same stuff can you throw some light on this?

Thanks,
Suman Kumar Dey.
