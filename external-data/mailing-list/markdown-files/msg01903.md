Riak Recap for Jan. 3 - 4

1) The team at BankSimple launched their blog with a great post about
the technology they are using. Riak got a nice shout out.

2) svjson, seancribbs, DeanZen, rustyk and others had a \_very\_ long
conversation in #riak that touched on everything from Riak Search, to
Cassandra, to capacity planning, to the role of vnodes, and much more.

Gist here ---> https://gist.github.com/767327

3) Multipart Stream Parsing landed in Ripple yesterday.

Details here ---> http://twitter.com/#!/seancribbs/status/22075326486020096

4) sragu and rustyk had a short chat in #riak that answers the
question, "How could I customize the index created for a xml document
with riak?"

Gist here ---> https://gist.github.com/767341

5) Reik Schatz wrote up a lengthy blog called, "Riak, Protocol Buffer
and Java in the Mix."
