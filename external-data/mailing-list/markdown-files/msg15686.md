Hello,

I just installed Riak+RiakCS and have it working with both s3cmd and the
official amazon aws s3 nodejs plugin

Is it true that riakCS does not yet support the "expires:" header? so
object lifetime / autoexpire isn't possible yet in riakcs? if not, does
anyone know when we could expect such a feature?
