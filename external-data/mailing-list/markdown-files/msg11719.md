We recommend that production Riak deployments run with at least 5
nodes. There are several reasons why we recommend 5, and they're
outlined pretty well in this post. [0]

If you want Riak to only be accessible via the local host, then
binding to 127.0.0.1 works. If you want to communicate with Riak from
other nodes, bind to an address that is accessible to the other nodes,
or 0.0.0.0.

Any node in a Riak cluster can coordinate requests for any other Riak
node that is responsible for the data you're reading/writing. That
said, it's common for users to deploy Riak clusters behind a load
balancer that evenly distributes requests to each node in the cluster.

Hope that helps.
