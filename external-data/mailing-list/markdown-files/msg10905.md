Hello. I've just installed the riak ubuntu package using the instructions
here:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/installation/Installing-on-Debian-and-Ubuntu/#Installing-From-Apt-Get

And the resulting /usr/lib/riak has an erts-5.9.1 directory, but the init
script installed in /etc/init.d/riak has a critical var defined as:

ERTS\_PATH=/usr/lib/riak/erts-5.9.1/bin

The result is that none of the init script's "stop" and "restart"
operations fail since start-stop-daemon is looking for the wrong process
path.

Is this a known bug? I haven't had much luck searching for issues, as I'm
not sure which of the many, many repos on https://github.com/basho/ might
be relevant to this corner of the riak project.

By the way, the README on https://github.com/basho/riak has a "how to
report bugs" section that sends you to the defunct bugzilla database which
sends you back to github.
