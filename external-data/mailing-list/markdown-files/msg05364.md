Since it's very difficult, if not impossible, to guarantee the atomicity of any 
action in a distributed system like Riak, you are very limited in your options.

1) Use an RDBMS. Since you're here, I'm guessing that you're already using Riak 
or else that Riak has qualities that you want for your application.
2) As Alex suggests, you can implement this in your application. This could 
also be difficult: the application must be aware of activity going on with 
objects in your database AND be able to roll them back. In pseudocode you'd do 
this:

orig = Riak.get('whatevs')
child = new Child(orig)


if Riak.put(child)
 if !Riak.link(orig, child)
 Riak.delete(child)
 // error up the stack
else
 // we don't care, the child didn't save. error up the stack
 
This is probably naive and is definitely tedious, even if you do implement your 
own application layer to handle read/write operations.

3) Pre-Commit hooks. I don't recall if you are allowed to modify other keys in 
a pre-commit hook, nor do I recall if it's a horrible idea, but it's always 
something you can look into.
