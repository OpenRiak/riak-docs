Hi Dan,

 I just managed to get a proper pull request sent to you for just the
documentation changes. Hopefully it works for you.

I also hope you guys consider joining back with the community of developers
working on erlang\_protobuffs so riak can be used along side other protobuff
based systems.

-Anthony
