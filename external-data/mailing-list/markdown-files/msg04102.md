Yesterday, somebody suggested that not for having the data
distributed on smaller buckets, Riak's MapReduce operations would be
faster... while nobody at Basho confirmed that yet, i'm now wondering
which is the best way for storing data... lets imagine this simple
excercise:

1. We have entities users, friends, statuses and comments in
a web app
2. Users can make friends with other users
3. Users can post
statuses
4. Friends ( Users ) can comment on user's statuses 

At first
i thought on having a bucket called "users" with all users and then for
friend linkage i was thinking on having personal buckets like
"rohman\_friends", "fyodor\_friends", etc... with the keys to the users
instead of a big "friends" bucket for easy querying... but seems i'm
wrong... so...

How would you distribute the data on buckets? and how
would you run MapReduce jobs? Would you use a support SQL database to
store relationship between keys? is possible on an only Riak
environment?
thanks
