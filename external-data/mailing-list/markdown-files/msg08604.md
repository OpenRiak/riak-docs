I'm in the process of designing an in game messaging system that basically
replicates the same functionality of email all within the context of the
application. I do not have a ton of experience with true key/value db
stores so I'm looking to find a good resource for ideas on how to best
model this. I have a first version, but I dont want to reinvent the wheel
if can help it. I've done the requisite googling, but haven't found
anything relevant yet. Are there any guides/tutorials/open source projects
that anyone knows of.

Thanks!
