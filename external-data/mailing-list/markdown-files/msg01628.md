Hi I've been able to get riak funning using brew but getting some glitches with 
client code so I decided to install from source to see if it helps any. Here is 
the error I'm getting:

abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)
./rebar get-deps
Uncaught error in rebar\_core: {'EXIT',
 {undef,
 [{crypto,start,[]},
 {rebar\_core,run,1},
 {rebar,main,1},
 {escript,run,2},
 {escript,start,1},
 {init,start\_it,1},
 {init,start\_em,1}]}}

=ERROR REPORT==== 26-Nov-2010::22:40:37 ===
Error in process <0.30.0> with exit value: 
{badarg,[{erlang,system\_info,[build\_type]},{crypto,on\_load,0},{code\_server,'-handle\_on\_load/4-fun-0-',1}]}

make: \*\*\* [deps] Error 1



Obviously it's looking for something that's not there... what libs need to be 
installed or present in the build package for this to work ?

Thanks in advance,

Jonah
