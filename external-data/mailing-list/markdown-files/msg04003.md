Greg,

I'm assuming you are using 14.2.

1) There is a bug in 14.2 that will cause a (potentially very fast growing)
memory leak when using AND. This is unfortunate, sorry. The good news I
have since patched it [1].

2) This is your best course of action, and you were so close but you've
actually crossed your fields. That is, the inline field should be the one
that contains the more common term (i.e. the 'text' field). So you should
perform a range query on your date with a filter on the text inline field.
 Obviously, the more terms in this field the more the index will inflate
(space-wise), but if you can live with that then it should reduce your
latency substantially (famous last words). Please try this and get back to
me.

3) That is a very well written article, props to the author. However, I
would leave this as a last resort. Try what I mentioned in #2, and if
that's not enough to get you by then let's brainstorm.
