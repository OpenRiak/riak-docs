Before you comment that data is not stored in DB - check it first. It is.
And HTTP map reduce gives results. So this is false trace.
Data is in data base, client 1.4 is able to run MR job and fetch that data
(written to default bucket type), HTTP client used by curl is running job &
fetching data.

So problem must be with Java Client version 2.0
