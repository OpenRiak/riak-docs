Hi Simon,

By cache size, I am assuming you are referring to the leveldb internal cache. 
Is this correct?

The arguably most important parameter in your configuration is the ring size. 
Defining an appropriate ring size is very important as it can't change later on 
and determines how far you can scale. It is recommended that you allow for at 
about 10 partitions per physical node 
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.3.0/references/appendices/Cluster-Capacity-Planning/#Ring-Size-Number-of-Partitions),
 which means that if you are preparing for a cluster of around 20 nodes, you 
should probably use 256 partitions.

At the moment we do not recommend tuning the eleveldb cache\_size at all, so it 
would be best to leave it at the default value.

With an n\_val of 3, Riak will store every record on 3 consecutive vnodes in the 
ring. The case where multiple copies may end up on less than 3 different 
physical servers primarily applies to cases where there are less than 4 nodes 
in the cluster as nodes will repeat around the ring wrap around point.This is 
one of the reasons we recommend using at least 5 nodes in the cluster.

Best regards,

Christian
