Hi,
I just pushed the release button for riak-java-client 1.0.2. It is on 
oss.sonatype and will find its way to maven when they sync. It is just a small 
bug fix release.

Bugs fixed are:

Incoming post commit hooks added to the pre-commit list (thanks to Bob Baker 
from Sharecare for that fix!)[1]
incorrect encoding of reduce\_phase\_only\_1 (Thanks Alexander Robbins for the 
report) [2]
PB connection timeout not applied [3]
Default PB port incorrect in builder [4]
Content-Type/Charset not split correctly for PB put (Thanks to Sergey for 
report) [5]

Thanks again to those who endured, caught, reported, and fixed bugs.

Cheers

Russell
