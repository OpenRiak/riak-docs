Sorry jumping into the discussion. What is a best way to monitor Riak node 
health? Most loadbalancer uses HTTP request to check if a node is alive. 

Currently we use Riak Java client to load balance requests to Riak. The issue 
is if a node gets removed or added all Java servers need to update 
configuration to reflect the changes. Itâ€™s kinda annoying for operation team. 
So we started thinking about putting LB between Riak cluster and Java clients. 

Thank you,
Konstantin.
