Hi

I just found that Java PB client does not support setting pr pw dw etc for
writes and reads.
Is it because I'm using IRiakClient interface and domain buckets or is it
not supported at all?
I would like to be able to set those properties for certain operations and
keep defaults or others and I don't mind using another client interface if
that functionality is supported.

When we can expect it to be implemented for domain buckets?

Thanks
Daniel
