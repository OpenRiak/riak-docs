Hi Varun,

I would recommend against blindly restarting Riak nodes, in particular if
these were shut down uncleanly, as may happen in out of memory situations.
There is a risk that an unclean shutdown leaves behind corrupted files and
that a subsequent restart is unsuccessful.

You should instead investigate why Riak stops being responsive.

Please have a look at the documentation, in particular memory
requirements[0], and OS tuning[1].

Kind Regards,

Magnus
