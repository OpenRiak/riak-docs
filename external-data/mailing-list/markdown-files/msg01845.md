Hey Bruce,

Without knowing too much about what a JCA wrapper would entail, it
\_might\_ be worthwhile to take a quick look at the work that Jon
Brisbin has done with Spring Riak --
https://github.com/jbrisbin/spring-riak. Other than that, I would say
hack away. I don't doubt that there are others who would find this
code useful.

Thanks,

Mark
