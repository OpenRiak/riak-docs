I have an experimental Riak build for Windows... There's still some
work that needs to be done though. My goal is to make Riak run on
Azure, but if others are interested in running Riak on Windows I'll
share my Windows binaries (once they are ready for public
consumption). Let me know...

Regards,
Kyle
