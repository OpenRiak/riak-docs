In our case we might collect and summarize everything in an intermediate
store before putting the final data into Riak. If the intermediate store is
not distributed then it will only talk to one Riak cluster (the one on the
same LAN). Replication will then be one-way from the insertion cluster to
all the others.

As I understand it there is no special one-way configuration since absence
of updates in one direction has no ill effects.
