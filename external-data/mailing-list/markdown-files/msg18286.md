Hello

I'm seeing the following error message for a number of objects:

console.log:2017-06-26 02:06:00.351 [error] <0.12343.73> gen\_fsm <0.12343.73> 
in state waiting\_vnode\_r terminated with reason: no function clause matching 
riak\_object:merge\_contents({r\_object,{<<"commercial">>,<<"precalculatedchar">>},<<"00002065">>,[{r\_content,{dict,7,16,16,8,...},...}],...},
 
{r\_object,{<<"commercial">>,<<"precalculatedchar">>},<<"00002065">>,[{r\_content,{dict,7,16,16,8,...},...}],...},
 <<"false">>) line 306

What does "no function clause matching riak\_object:merge\_contents" mean?

Thanks

Mark
