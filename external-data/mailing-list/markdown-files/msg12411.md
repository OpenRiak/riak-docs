Hi,

I'm trying to tune our Riak cluster using 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/#Parameter-Planning
but I'm still lost on how to use the calculation results, here are my 
questions:


1. Does this calculator
 
https://github.com/basho/basho\_docs/raw/master/source/data/LevelDB1.2MemModel\_calculator.xls
 applies to Riak 1.4.2?
2. How do I verify my running configuration? (I tried riak-admin status
 but somehow I can't relate the calculation with the obtained status,
 etc.)
3. And finally, based on the calculator, how do I use the results, what
 pertinent variables am I supposed to set in app.config in the
 LevelDB section?


Thanks,

Guido.
