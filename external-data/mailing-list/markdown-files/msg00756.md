Indeed, in my case it is :(

I agree however, the same thing can be accomplished by prefixing your keys
with a "namespace"...

bucket\_1\_keyA, bucket\_2\_keyA, bucket\_3\_keyA

Obviously, buckets in Riak have additional functionality and allow for some
more complex but easier to use m/r functions across multiple buckets,
etc...

For me, I am more than willing to add a small amount of overhead to the
storage engine for increased functionality and reduced overhead on the
application layer. Again this is obviously application specific and I'm not
saying it should all be converted over for all buckets exiting in their own
space for every implementation but certainly a different storage engine or
configuration option to allow this level/type of access would be nice :)

Haha, these are the exact reasons I would cite as a developer for using a
similar method on Riak's side... without the option of auto bucket indexing
it effectively places this double write into the application side where it
requires more cycles and more data across the wire. Instead of doing a
single write, from the application side, and allowing Riak to handle this,
you have to GET index\_key, UPDATE index\_key, ADD new\_key... So rather than
having a single transaction with Riak, you have to have three transactions
with Riak + Application functionality. Inherently, this adds another level
of complexity into the application code base for something that could be
done more efficiently by the DB engine itself.

I would think a separate error number and message would suffice as a return
error, obviously though, this would require developers being made aware so
they can code for the exception.

Also, this would be optional, if the index\_key wasn't set for the bucket
then this setup wouldn't be used. This would at least make the system more
flexible to the application requirements and developer preferences.

Some very valuable information, for me, would be seeing a breakdown of how
Riak scales out...

Something like showing how many keys in how many buckets takes how long with
how many nodes... (extended by, now with 2 more machines, now with more
complex m/r funcs, now with twice as many keys, etc...) I know this largely
depends on whatever map/reduce functions are being run however even a simple
example would be nice to see. As it is I have no idea how many queries per
second of what type I can run with how many active nodes? Again, I realize
this is something that needs to be benchmarked for any sort of accuracy but
I'm speaking more of targeting developers, like myself, who are looking into
this as a newer technology that may work for them. It is a very large
commitment of time and resources to design and implement something then
benchmark it in order to obtain the "if it will work for this application
efficiently" answer. Having some baseline stats from which to start may
prompt more developers to explore Riak as a storage solution.

And one more thanks for hearing me out and your feedback. I'd also like to
reiterate that I'm coming from a limited nosql background... however I feel
that's the case with the majority of developers out there today. My
recommendations for options are based on the real world application design
challenges I've personally been presented with over my career and that I
feel may be common to many other developers as well. Obviously, even adding
a single option such that I've mentioned is a massive undertaking on Basho's
part but they are definitely pieces of functionality that would make me say,
"done, Riak it is". Rather than... is there something else which would
better suit my needs... and when vying for adoption rate that's a major
factor :)
