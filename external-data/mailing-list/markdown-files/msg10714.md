Greetings all...

It appears I've found a small bug in the stats changes introduced in 1.3.1.

We don't use protocol buffers at all, but as of 1.3.1 we now see the
following filling up console.log:

2013-04-05 07:13:05.900 [warning]
<0.12654.0>@riak\_core\_stat\_q:log\_error:123 Failed to calculate stat
{riak\_api,pbc\_connects,active} with
exit:{noproc,{gen\_server,call,[riak\_api\_pb\_sup,count\_children,infinity]}}

The only real problem is that it's spamming the log file, but it's not
really a warning - it's expected behaviour...

Chris
