Hello everyone,

I installed riak on an Ubuntu 12.04 64 instance, no problem, but then
I get the "Open Files Limit" error.

So I follow this guide
http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.2.0/cookbooks/Open-Files-Limit/ and set
the pam.
The first time I ignored the 5. (optional) and "should" is not clear
enough that you can screw up your instance here.

So I didn't made the change in the /etc/ssh/sshd\_config and I was
still able to log in after reboot but the connection closed
immediately afterwards.

I terminated the instance and started over, now I changed UseLogin to
yes and now the connection refuses immediately.
No way to access the instance now.

What should I do?
This is kinda annoying. There is not much information about pam and
SSH and all the posts about refused connections tell me to change
configuration files ... not really helpful.

Cheers Severin
