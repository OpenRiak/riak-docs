I've just glanced over the riak design overview and I think I am missing 
something basic in the failover technique. The docs explain that any 
node can process any query and that adding nodes will re-balance the 
storage. My question is, how does the client know which server node to 
contact initially and what happens if that node is the one that has 
failed - particularly for the rest interface where you don't have a 
special client? Do you typically put server nodes on the same host as 
the clients so they can use a localhost connection, use round robin DNS, 
put them behind a load balancer or is there some unique way of handling 
this?
