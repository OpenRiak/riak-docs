The Riak Ruby client version 2.2.1 is now available. This gem is an 
officially-supported client for the Riak key-value database, including support 
for key-value objects, buckets, bucket types, bucket properties, Riak 
Search/Yokozuna, secondary indexes, and more.

This version, 2.2.1, is a bugfix release, and includes additional testing of 
character encodings.

Bug fixes:

\* Support bucket-typed buckets when creating secondary-index input phases
 for map-reduce, thanks to Takeshi Akima.
\* Support Riak Search 2 / Yokozuna results as input phases for map-reduce,
 thanks again to Takeshi Akima.
\* `BucketTyped::Bucket#get\_index` now includes the bucket type name in the
 2i request.
\* `Bucket#==` now performs an encoding-independent comparison on bucket names.
\* `BucketType#==` also does an encoding-independent comparison on type names.

Testing enhancements:

\* Non-ASCII UTF-8 strings, and binary strings containing byte 255 are tested
 with key-value, secondary index, CRDT, and Riak Search interfaces. These
 findings are available on our documentation site:
 http://basho.github.io/riak-ruby-client/encoding.html 


Updating your applications that use Bundler is easy: make sure the Gemfile 
doesnâ€™t exclude 2.2.1, and `bundle update riak-client`. Gems and applications 
that transitively depend on riak-client may have a more complex update 
procedure, or it may be as simple as a `bundle update`. Make sure your tests 
pass before putting it into production!
