I have a similar problem to an earlier mailing list post :
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2010-May/001094.html

I tried following
riak/client\_lib/riak-erlang-client/docs/pb-client.txt plus the
suggestions in that post all to no avail.

But, here is in detail what I attempted:

> erl -pa $PATHTORIAKC/ebin

I naturally replaced PATHTORIAKC :
/home/tedkarmel/riak/client-libs/riak-erlang-client

It seems to work but then I get 'non\_existing' when I tried to enter

> code:which(riak\_pb\_client).

I then tried the suggested alternative installation

> cd riak-erlang-client

> ./rebar install

I get the following error message:

Error: One or more modules listed in riackc.app are not present in ebin/\*.beam
\*riackc\_obj
\*riackc\_pb
\*riackc\_pb\_socket
\*riackclient\_pb

I then tried the following which was suggested in the previous mailing
post about installation errors:

> make clean && make all

Then I try again

> ./rebar install

which works this time

But when I try again

> code:which(riak\_pb\_client).

I get

> non\_existing

I then tried as suggested in the previous mailing list post about the error

> erl -pa ebin/ deps/\*/ebin

But still get the non\_existing error

help... :(
