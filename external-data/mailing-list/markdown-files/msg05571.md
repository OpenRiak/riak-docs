Hi,
This is more sort of a discussion than a question. I am just trying to see
the trend in how users import their data to Riak.
For the data I am using, I was able to achieve almost 150 records/second
with PHP library, and 400 records/second with node.js (fairly new with
node; was hitting memory wall when trying to import 1 million records).
What are some hacks/tricks/tweaks to import large amount of data to Riak?

Cheers
Nitish
