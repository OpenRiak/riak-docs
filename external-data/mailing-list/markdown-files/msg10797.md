Yuri,

You're certainly not the only one dealing with this. Sorry about that. It's bit 
us here at Basho a few times too. As you saw, we're moving toward not having 
master dependencies, at least for tagged versions of repos. Especially for 
projects that are likely to be dependencies in other projects (ie. our client 
libraries, lager, etc.). That being said, it will take us some time to get 
there. You should also be aware of another 'fun' issue with rebar: if multiple 
dependencies require the same dep, the version that rebar first encounters will 
be the one that gets used. You'll find it helpful to use `./rebar list-deps` to 
see exactly what's being used in your project. I agree that this is something 
the Erlang community could improve, but in the short-term we're going to be 
more diligent about using recursively using tags for all tagged repos.

Reid
