I have an application based on Riak. I have a few simple models stored in Riak 
so far, and all lookups are performed by primary key, a la Model.find(...)

Next, I need to find data by the values of properties, including the properties 
of associations. 

I have been through the rspec suite for Ripple, but cannot find the information 
I need. I looked at the Indexer models, but I am still a little clueless. 

I am hunting for information on:

1/ What I need to do to enable search for my buckets

2/ How to index models, including the associations -- do I have to build a 
schema, where does it go, etc.

3/ How to perform the searches to find data by property values, associations' 
property values, and embedded documents

4/ Any sys admin magic I need. 


I get this so far... which I cannot decipher. 

$ search-cmd index /riak/Bucket/zids

 :: Indexing path '/riak/Bucket/zids' in search...

Starting...
RPC to 'riak@127.0.0.1' failed: {'EXIT',
 {badarg,
 [{ets,lookup,[schema\_table,<<"search">>]},
 {riak\_search\_config,get\_schema,1},
 {riak\_search\_dir\_indexer,
 start\_worker\_loop,4}]}}


Any pointers are greatly appreciated. 

Martin
