Riak can benefit from having a large number of buckets, but it's very use
case specific.

In direct answer to your question, your data model might be better served
by storing all of a player's units in a single value; e.g. units/peschkaj
instead of having between 10 and 20 keys in a units\_peschkaj bucket. The
reasoning here being that a read of a single key is going to be less load
on the system than 20 reads, even though that one key might be 20x larger.

You need to be aware of data access patterns - if multiple actors in your
system can modify the same value, then you need to account for that in your
data access patterns and either serialize writes through a single point
(not a great idea for concurrency) or potentially allow conflicts to occur
and have your application manage sibling resolution.

You also need to be aware of the size of each value that you're storing,
especially if you have siblings. There are performance implications of
storing objects around 4MB in size.
