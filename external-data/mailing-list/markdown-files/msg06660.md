I've been working on my own "simple" memory resident database on top
of riak core. I've been doing this as part of my work on building a
mud (multi-user dungeon) that will run in a distributed and clustered
environment. I hope that I'll be able to release the DB application in
the not too distant future in order to provide another simplish
example of using riak core. Once I do, I'll follow up on here and
hopefully it'll give you a little more insight into riak core.

Cheers,

Jeff
