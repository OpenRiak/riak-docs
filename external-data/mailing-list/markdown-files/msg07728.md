I am trying to get the 4 node setup working on my os x lion machine.

sorry If you are getting this a second time but I think my first mail got
lost because I was a non member.

I installed riak using

$ brew install riak

I am using the online documentation available -
http://wiki.basho.com/Building-a-Development-Environment.html

I am stuck on this step - "Use rebar to start up four nodes. "

After installing riak, do I have to install rebar as well? After installing
riak I directly tried the

$ make devrel

command and it gave the following error

make: \*\*\* No rule to make target `devrel'. Stop.
