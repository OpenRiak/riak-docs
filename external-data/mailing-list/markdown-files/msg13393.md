How well does Riak Search play with backups? Can you backup the Riak
Search data without bringing the node down?

The Riak documentation backup page is completely silent on Riak Search and
its merge\_index backend.

And looking forward, what is the backup strategy for Yokozuna? Will it
make use of Solr's Replication Handler, or something more lower level?
 Will the node need to be offline to backup it up?
