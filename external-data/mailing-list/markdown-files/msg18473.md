Hi Russell and all,

I noticed the reference to offer G-sets (assuming its grow only sets) in an 
upcoming release. Would it make sense to also support grow only maps? 

I know that there are already add-wins recursive maps in Riak, but it requires 
all that causal context management that add-wins sets also require. In contrast 
a grow only map could be useful for simpler use cases that do not need deletion 
of keys. I recall that I used such a structure to help implement bounded 
counters on top of it. 

Again, not sure if this makes sense, but wanted to suggest it as a natural 
companion to a G-set.

Best and good work on rebooting Riak,
Carlos
