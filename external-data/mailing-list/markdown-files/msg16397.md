Hi All,

The clients team has been hard at work on an official Riak Go client, and weâ€™re 
ready to share our progress.

To install it in your go project, just run `go get 
github.com/basho/riak-go-client` .

You can find more information on the project page 
(https://github.com/basho/riak-go-client 
), and in the API docs 
(https://godoc.org/github.com/basho/riak-go-client 
).

Special thanks to Luke Bakkan & Chris Mancini for their work on the client, and 
Timo Gatsonides for his inspiring work on goriakpbc.


.NET Client 2.1.1

Available at: https://www.nuget.org/packages/RiakClient/2.1.1 


This release fixes a bug in the RiakPbcSocket class where connections were not 
being reclaimed after a forcible disconnect, which could result in running out 
of connections.

Special thanks to Joseph Jeganathan for reporting the issue & the PR.


Thanks,
Alex
