Hi,
I have around 5000 keys which just won't die.
No matter how many times I delete them, they still show up in the 2i 
$bucket=\_ index.


Actually attempting to retreive the keys results in a not-found - even 
if I've requested that tombstones be returned.


I'm interested to know what is going on here?

Cheers,
Toby
