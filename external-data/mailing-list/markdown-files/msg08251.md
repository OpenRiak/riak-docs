Sure thing!

Any time that you can avoid a hit to disk, you should avoid using disk. In the 
RDBMS world, we put caches in front of SQL Server, even though SQL Server will 
devour all RAM in the known universe if you let it. Likewise, why read from 
potentially slow disks when you can try to hit cache first?
