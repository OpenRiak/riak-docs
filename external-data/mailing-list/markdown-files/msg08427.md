Hi,

I need top add a node to a cluster.

I get this error

root@dp-riak-hk:~# riak-admin join -f riak@103.4.11.11
Attempting to restart script through sudo -H -u riak



Attempting to restart script through sudo -H -u riak
Failed: This node is already a member of a cluster

Well...that node is not a member of a cluster. At least greater than 1.

How dl I resolve?
