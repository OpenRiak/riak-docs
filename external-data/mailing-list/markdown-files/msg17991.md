OK, I took the machine down intending to write my own quick and easy key value 
db (I have done this before) but I have told my uni that I am using Riak so I 
thought that I ought to have another go.
I have reinstalled Ubuntu and Riak. The computer now has an internal IP 
(192.168.1.94) rather than an external fixed IP. I started up Riak and got a 
pong. I then tried to connect with my software from that already works with 
the Riak I have running on Amazon AWS so I know that the software works - just 
a request for a list of buckets.
I got a "Connection refused error. I checked and 8098 was closed. I edited 
Riak.conf as advices from 127.0.0.0 to 0.0.0.0 but now Riak won't start (Riak 
failed to start in 15 seconds).
I really want to get this working and, given I have an assignment due in a few 
days, sooner rather than later. It is working fine on AWS but it is such a 
faff getting onto that using ssh as I am never sure of my key to use so I can't 
check the config there.
This can't be hard, can it?
Please help.
David

Yeah, what Alex said. You can't see it with your application because it's 
currently bound to the localhost loopback address, but it's bad to just expose 
everything publicly. 
1. Where is this cluster running? (AWS or local dev cluster?)2. What are you 
trying to connect to Riak with? Is it one of our clients or just raw HTTP 
requests?
Thanks,Alex
