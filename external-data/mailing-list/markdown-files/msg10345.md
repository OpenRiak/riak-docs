Hello guys, 

I have some question about using a links. 
In our data model each object A has a lot of links to other objects and we are 
doing a lot of queries to fetch all objects that linked with A. 
Could it be a performance issue? 
Will it be more faster to store list of ids of related objects and fetch them 
by ids?

Thank you.
