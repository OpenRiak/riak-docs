Riak Recap for July 18 - 19
====================

1) We announced a Riak and Python Webinar that's happening on August
2nd and will be hosted by Basho Developer Advocate Mathias Meyer.

2) Alen Mujezinovic released version 0.2 of his Riak-backed session
backend for Django.

\* Repo on GitHub ---> https://github.com/flashingpumpkin/django-riak-sessions
\* Package on PyPI ---> http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-riak-sessions/0.0.2

3) Russell Smith represented Riak at a NoSQL throw down (of sorts)
that happened at the most recent Cassandra London Meetup, and they
just released the video of his preso. This one runs about 17 minutes
and is a great general overview of Riak.

Thanks, Russell!
