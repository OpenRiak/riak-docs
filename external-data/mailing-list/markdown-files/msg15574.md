I have installed Riak in ec2 and kept it wide open for inbound connections.
>From the source instance, We have configured outbound ports 8087 an 8098 to
the public IP of Riak Instance.

Any other ports are required? I'm using python and curl clients but still
not able to connect on both the ports

Please let me know if I'm missing something

Thanks
Santi
