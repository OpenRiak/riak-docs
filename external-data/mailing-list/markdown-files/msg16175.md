Hello,

Has anyone had to run 1.2.1 on Ubuntu Trusty? I was hoping to obtain
an apt package, but I see that there is no 1.2.1 Trusty build, nor are
there any builds for Trusty before 2.0 (which is on package cloud). As
we seek to bump up our versions, we'd hope to have packages of all
versions for Trusty.

Thank you!
