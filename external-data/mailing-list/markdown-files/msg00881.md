Yes, we agree Riak should never mess with escaping \*and\* non-url-safe
keys should be treated as errors for the HTTP interface (or for all,
what if you save a document via Erlang or the protobuf interface and
then you want to retrieve it with HTTP GET?).

I think not only it's important to fix
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=617 , but also to clearly
state how client lib implementors should deal with this (basically,
that they should take care of all escaping in a uniform manner).

If I understand correctly this would involve changing my keys and atm
it's not really feasible in our app. As a workaround until this is
fixed, I patched Ripple so that it doesn't escape:
http://github.com/frank06/ripple/commit/baa326f0f6041f9ab2401e0606cd35533e878cf0
(works ok so far).

Thanks,
Francisco
