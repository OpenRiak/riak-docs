Hi Magnus,
I thought that it was recommended AGAINST talking to a co-located Riak on
the same host?
The reason being, the local Riak will take longer to start up than Riak CS,
once you have a sizeable amount of data. This means Riak CS starts up,
fails to connect to Riak, and exits.
You also end up in a situation where you must always restart Riak CS if you
restart the co-located Riak. (Otherwise the Riak CS PBC connections suffer
the same problem as I described in my earlier email, where Riak CS doesn't
realise it needs to reconnect them and returns errors).

Putting haproxy between Riak CS and Riak solved the problem of needing the
local Riak to be started first.
But it seems we just were putting the core problem off, rather than solving
it. ie. That Riak CS doesn't understand it needs to re-connect and retry.

I'm surprised more people with highly-available Riak CS installations
haven't hit the same issues.
