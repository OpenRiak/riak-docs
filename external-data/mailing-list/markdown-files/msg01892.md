We are exploring a Java bridge from Riak to Mahout.
I have a few questions at this point:
1.) How is parallelization done in Riak?
2.) What internal mechanisms are in Riak to do parallelizations of
large matrices?
3.) How does Riak handle multiple cores in complex and data I/O
intensive algorithms?

I'm sure it's in the documentation somewhere -- can you point out the locations?
