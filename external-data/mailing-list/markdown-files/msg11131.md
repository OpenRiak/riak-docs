I'm not sure I am much better off than you my understanding yes. The CRDT
approach simply allows you to retrieve all stored copies and correct them
yourself (riak not making any judgement about what is correct). If you can
write code that knows how to merge the disparate records, then you are safe
and can avoid data loss (but you cannot guarantee that incorrect data will
never be displayed).

If you write your application such that the client always sends and
receives complete records, then LLW is probably a sane thing because
regardless of anything else, the end user has said, "This is exactly what I
want the record to be".

If however your client is sends "add foo to the record", you have no way of
knowing what the client thought "foo" looked like (without some additional
data at least). This is where versions, checksums, or timestamps of
records can come into play. Your client can say "add foo to version the
record, and by the way, the version/checksum/timestamp of the record should
be X". Now you can do something smart with that. I'm not saying this is
an example that should be followed, but it is rather just what popped into
my head and certainly needs some revising. Hopefully, that helps point you
in the right direction.
