Hi Vladyslav,

The Riak-KV 2.1.0 release had a misconfigured default handoff\_ip setting
which caused nodes to hand off partition data to themselves, leading to
potential data loss. This was fixed with an update to the riak\_core module.
As the riak\_kv module was not affected, its version number remained the
same for the bug-fix release 2.1.1 of Riak-KV.

While largely accurate for historical releases, this page has not yet been
updated to take the compatibility statement from
https://github.com/basho/riak\_cs/blob/2.1/RELEASE-NOTES.md into account:
"Riak S2 2.1 is designed to work with both Riak KV 2.0.5+ and 2.1.1+."

You can also use the currently released Riak-KV versions 2.1.3 and 2.0.6
with Riak-S2 2.1.1.

I hope this helps.

Kind regards,

Magnus
