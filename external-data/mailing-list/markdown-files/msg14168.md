Hector Castro has a wonderful project for starting a riak cluster inside
containers on a single host (https://github.com/hectcastro/docker-riak)

I have been trying to do a similar deployment in EC2, but with each Docker
container/node deployed to a separate instance. This has not been
successful. The sticking point I believe is that the name of the riak node
is not visible outside the instance.

Has anyone been able to successfully deploy a Riak cluster using Docker
images and have those images deployed to different hosts?

Thanks in advance.
