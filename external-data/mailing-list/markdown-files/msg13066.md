You're on the right track. Avoiding the commit hooks might work better though.

Precomputing in the content of your use case could look something like:

At write time, store the event data in a key/value pair, but also
create another key that has an invoice sum for a specific vendor along
with a date:

INVOICE\_SUM:VENDOR\_NAME:DATE

At the end of two weeks, you can get all of the keys that make up two
weeks for a specific vendor and sum them up in your client-side code:

INVOICE\_SUM:VENDORX:20131122 = 5
INVOICE\_SUM:VENDORX:20131121 = 10
INVOICE\_SUM:VENDORX:20131120 = 54

Then do the same for the next vendor. If it makes sense to roll up the
sums at something larger than a day, you can do that too.
