Hi Kevin,

The top of the document you reference has this disclaimer:

"This document refers to the now deprecated Riak Search."

Please use this document as a reference (you link to it earlier in your email):

http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/using/search/

Finally, if you inserted objects using Riak's Key/Value operations,
you should delete them that way as well. Have you tried that?
