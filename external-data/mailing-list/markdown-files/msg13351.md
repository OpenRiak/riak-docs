Hi everyone,

Experiencing some weird behaviour in a cluster of 3 nodes. As of this morning, 
we noticed a massive performance lag and when checking the logs Active 
Anti-Entropy Exchange suddenly began initiating a huge series of transfers. 
Here’s what we see in the logs:

2014-01-02 19:26:34.396 [info] 
<0.1571.1800>@riak\_kv\_exchange\_fsm:key\_exchange:206 Repaired 882 keys during 
active anti-entropy exchange of 
{228359630832953580969325755111919221821239459840,3} between 
{228359630832953580969325755111919221821239459840,'riak@192.168.3.2'} and 
{251195593916248939066258330623111144003363405824,'riak@192.168.3.3’}

When we check the logs on all 3 nodes we only had a few process crashes 10 
hours ago, nothing in between that time and now. It all came on suddenly. Any 
idea if this is normal and will fix itself or if we need to intervene?

Thanks!
