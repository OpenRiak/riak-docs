Hello,

I have 3 nodes in a development environment that were configured in a cluster. 
It was working fine until one of the servers crashed. I tried clearing the 
data directory and was able to removed the crashed node from the cluster. When 
I try to add the third node back in, I get the following error:
Failed: riak@ has a different ring\_creation\_size

All 3 nodes have ring\_size set to 64 in the riak.conf. Has anyone experienced 
this error and have a suggestion for adding the node back into the ring?

Thanks,
Troy
