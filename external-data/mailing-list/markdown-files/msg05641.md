I pushed to my Github a Lager backend for sending log messages to RabbitMQ via 
AMQP: 

https://github.com/jbrisbin/lager\_amqp\_backend 

It uses a re-connecting connection pool for sending messages, so it's pretty 
fast and will automatically recover if RabbitMQ goes down (but it does \*not\*, 
at the moment, internally queue log messages if it can't connect to the 
broker). 

The idea is to aggregate logging from riak\_core applications, but you should be 
able to use it in Riak/DB as well. 



Thanks!
