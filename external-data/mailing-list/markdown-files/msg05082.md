Hi Greg,

Did some investigation into this issue. This is indeed a bug introduced in
1.0.

Specifically, it affects filtering on inline fields when that field is also
used in the search query. In other words, if your main search is on field
"ctime" and the filter is on field "foo", then this bug is not triggered.

This issue is tracked here: https://issues.basho.com/1240

There is no easy workaround, so your special cased search logic is probably
the best route until this is fixed.

Best,
Rusty
