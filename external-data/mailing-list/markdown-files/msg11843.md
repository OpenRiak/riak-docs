Greetings, Riak world.

It's time to say farewell to July. There will be many opportunities to see the 
Basho crew out and about in August, so I've included the next couple of weeks 
below, and you can always visit http://basho.com/events to see what's coming to 
your community.

Don't forget that the granddaddy Riak event of them all is looming: RICON West 
in San Francisco in October. Grab your early bird tickets while you can, and 
expect to hear more about the speakers very soon.
