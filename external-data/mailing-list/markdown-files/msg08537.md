Hi all,
I was just wondering if you could give me some feedback on my usage of RIAK. 
I'm currently testing a number of datastores and am trying to come up with 
pros/ cons of each.

I have a variety of tests (write speed 1 client, write speed 10 clients, read 
speed 1 client, read speed 10 clients, read while writing, write while reading 
etc). The data set is tiny for this phase (10k, 50k, 100k).

I have 3 machines in the cluster (each with 12GB RAM, quadcore CPUs, 500GB 
drives), each cache setup to use 128MB memory (eleveldb). Each key is 64 
bytes. and each value is 512 bytes.


The write speed I'm getting is around 260.0440791 per second (using 1 client), 
scaling to 2281.1662 writes per second (using 10 clients).
The read speed I'm getting is around 397.2291042 per second (using 1 client), 
scaling to 3316.089445 reads per second (using 10 clients).

One very worrying thing I noticed is that I sometimes miss keys? i.e. I write 
100k keys to disk, then read them all back in and check the value matches 
expected. This would only happen for 1 or 2 keys out of 100k, but (1 or 2 keys 
is enoughâ€¦)

This is using the latest version of RIAK with the python client (python client 
is running on a 4th machine).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,
Pat.
