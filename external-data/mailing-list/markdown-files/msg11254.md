Hello,

I would like to aggregate inserted docs using post commit hooks. Is this
possible using Javascript? It seems it is possible with Erlang but I can't
seem to find the docs that provide you with the API available to create a
get and update a key in another bucket.

I have only seen this:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.3.1/references/appendices/concepts/Commit-Hooks/#Post-Commit-Hooks

Is the erlang api in post commit hooks there the same as the erlang HTTP
client here:

Regards,
Kartik
