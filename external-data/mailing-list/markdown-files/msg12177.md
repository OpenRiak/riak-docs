I installed Riak on my development machine (32 bit Lubuntu 13.04), and ran
stress test on it using siege (http://www.joedog.org/siege-home/). The test
is just a series of concurrent HTTP requests:

file riak-benchmark.siege:

 http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/tweets/test PUT <./sample-tweet.json

where sample-tweet.json is a file with a sample tweet from twitter.com

and this is the command that I ran using the above file:

siege -c200 -r1000 --header"Content-Type: application/json"
-friak-benchmark.siege



I did the same with CouchDB, but using this file:

http://127.0.0.1:5984/tweets POST <./sample-tweet.json


I got the numbers below. Transaction rate for CouchDB is much larger than
that for Riak. I must be doing something wrong. I have just started looking
at Riak, I have not changed any settings, except for I enabled SSL and
riak-control. I have started one node and did not configure a cluster.
Using the default back-end.

Would appreciate any advice on how to get the numbers higher.
