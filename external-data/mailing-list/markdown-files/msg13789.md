Hi everyone, we are running Riak 1.4.1 on RHEL 6.2 using bitcask. We are
using protobufs with the Java client, and our binary objects are typically
a few hundred KB in size. I have noticed a persistent anomaly with riak
reads and writes. It seems like often, maybe 0.5% of the time, writing to
Riak takes 60 seconds longer than it should. Here is a prime example I just
trimmed from a log file (see the last time entry below).

This is not bitcask merge related because it happens before any of the
bitcask slabs are large enough to merge. I am seeing lots of busy\_dist\_port
messages in the Riak logs. One unique setting is that we have a small zdbbl
setting of 128K because this seemed to prevent congestive collapse of
throughput at high sustained loads. I believe that this 60 second timeout
persisted across the various zdbbl settings we tried. Also we see this
occasional 60 second delay on both VMs and real server hardware.

Does anyone know where this 60 second delay comes from?

Thanks!

-Matt
