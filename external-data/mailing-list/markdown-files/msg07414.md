Hi, guys,

It's about half an year past after the R15B has been released, after all.

I just change the rebar.config in
riak/riak\_kv/riak\_search/cluster\_info, It looks riak work well on
erlang/OTP R15B01. but I guess you guys must have reason not to
support R15B now, I just wander about it.

Best regards.
