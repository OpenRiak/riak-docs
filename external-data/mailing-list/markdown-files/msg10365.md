Right after setting up the cluster of 3 nodes before riak finishes vnode
transfers (ring 512)
I store 3000 keys
On some occasions instead of having 3000 keys listed I have 2999 or 2989.
After transfer is finished we have 3000 keys visible via listing.

Why is that happening and what's the best way to approach that?

I assume it will happen also when new node attached to the cluster in
production...

Riak 1.2.1

Daniel
