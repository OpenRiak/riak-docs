Hi all,
I've some events stored in Riak KV which I'd like to use as input to Amazon
Machine Learning.
What I want to accomplish is to export the JSON entries from Riak transform
it to a CSV file and upload it to S3.

What is the best way to export a full bucket (or a 2i subset) from Riak?

I've read there were some improvements in Riak in this sense in order to
build Apache Spark Connector (
https://databricks.com/blog/2016/08/11/the-quest-for-hidden-treasure-an-apache-spark-connector-for-the-riak-nosql-database.html
)

Is there a way to take advantage of the new full bucket read and of the
distributed export?

Thanks.
