Sorry, I meant "stopping Tomcat from shutting down properly"...I must 
have been thinking of some FPS night game.

Hi,

We are tracing some threads at our webapp which are stopping Tomcat 
from shooting down properly, one of them seems to be related with Riak 
Java client, here is the repeating stack trace once all services have 
been stopped properly:


\*Thread Name:\* riak-stream-timeout-thread
\*State:\* in Object.wait()
\*Java Stack trace:\*
at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)
- waiting on [0x00000004bb4001a0] (a java.util.TaskQueue)
at java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:503)
at java.util.TimerThread.mainLoop(Timer.java:526)
- locked [0x00000004bb4001a0] (a java.util.TaskQueue)
at java.util.TimerThread.run(Timer.java:505)


Thanks for the help,

Guido.
