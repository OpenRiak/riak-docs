Okay, I figured it out.

I am running riakc as a dep of my application, which is based on riak\_core.

This causes the problem of 0.5.1 vs 0.6

Doing a "make" in the riakc directory does work.

It looks like my riak\_core is specifying 0.5.1, pulling it, and then when
riakc comes along it wants 0.6 but has already pulled 0.5.1 and tries to use
that...and fails.

So I'm going to set my riak\_core deps line to use 0.6 and make sure I don't
repull it before it's updated in the repo. :)

And...it works!

Thanks!
