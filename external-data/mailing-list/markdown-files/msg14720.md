Hi,

I have setup Riak on my server with the Riak Control enabled and authenticated. 
Everything seems to be up and running fine, once I enable the 
control port on my firewall, I can successfully navigate to 
https://mymachine:myport/admin and it will ask for login details.

However, if I just put in the URL https://mymachine:myport it will show a list 
of options …. { riak\_kv\_wm\_ping, riak\_kb\_wm\_stats , … etc…. }
These seem to be available without password authentication, is there any way to 
ensure that just the admin guy becomes available or that
the base address https://mymachine:myport is authenticated?

Thanks,
Mike
