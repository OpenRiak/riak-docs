My interpretation is:

- you upgraded to 1.3.x on April 3 (interesting, but not important)

- your data arrival rate since then has not been sufficient to cause any 
compactions at level-5 in almost a year

- only you can decide whether or not the age of the files implies that the data 
is no longer retrieved for use
