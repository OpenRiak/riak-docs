Alex,

Nice work benchmarking! One thing to keep in mind (and you probably
are well aware of this), particularly when benchmarking on cloud
platforms, is that there are a lot of factors that affect performance
outside -- other tenants, blackbox hardware upgrades, changes in SLAs
-- just to name a few. What you may see today in your benchmarks may
not be what you see tomorrow, or even in the next hour. Some
providers do offer performance SLAs and/or guaranteed IOPs, and this
can help mitigate the problem, but doesn't necessarily remove it.

You might find this article interesting (although a bit dated):
