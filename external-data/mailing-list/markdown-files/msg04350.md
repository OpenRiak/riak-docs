Good news everyone!

CorrugatedIron, the .NET Riak client library, has received a bit more love: 
http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2011/08/corrugatediron-v-now-options/

Thanks to Vincent Theeten (@VincentTheeten), OJ and I removed our first round 
assumption that everyone loves JSON. 

What did we do? Well, we added automatic serialization/deserialization through 
our GetObject() and SetObject() methods. Right now this only works for 
XML, Protocol Buffers, and JSON encoded documents (we added new MIME types for 
XML and Protocol Buffers, too). This is a convenience for many people, so we 
hope that it will get more people interested in using Riak in a .NET 
environment.

Future plans around this feature involve letting users specify custom 
serializers and deserializers. Fancy, eh?

If you're interested, head over to the download page and pull down the source 
in your favorite format: http://corrugatediron.org/downloads.html

Happy Riaking!

P.S. there are binaries, too.
