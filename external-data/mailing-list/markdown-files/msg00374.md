Hi all,

Another question...

I think i understand what does it mean, but how can i change it ?
What are the consequences of this kind error ?

100513 1:13:21 InnoDB: ERROR: the age of the last checkpoint is 
140104147910808,

InnoDB: which exceeds the log group capacity 1.
InnoDB: If you are using big BLOB or TEXT rows, you must set the
InnoDB: combined size of log files at least 10 times bigger than the
InnoDB: largest such row.

Thank you for your answer.

Best regards,
Germain
