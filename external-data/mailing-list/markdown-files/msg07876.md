Hey All,

We just published the latest community release notes covering the month of
June (give or take a few days):

Tom also posted a short write up about it on the Basho blog:

There's a lot of great stuff in there, but we probably missed some
noteworthy accomplishments, so don't hesitate to add or complain if we
missed something :)

Thanks and have a great weekend.
