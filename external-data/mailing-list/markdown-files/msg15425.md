If you can attach to a vnode and run

BKey = {<<“you\_bucket”>>, <<“your\_key”>>}.
Preflist = fun(BK) ->
 {ok, Ring} = riak\_core\_ring\_manager:get\_my\_ring(),
 DocIdx = riak\_core\_util:chash\_key(BK),
 UpNodes = riak\_core\_node\_watcher:nodes(riak\_kv),
 Preflist = riak\_core\_apl:get\_apl\_ann(DocIdx, 3, Ring, UpNodes),
 [IndexNode || {IndexNode, \_Type} <- Preflist]
end.
PL = Preflist(BKey).
ReqId = <<"my\_req\_id">>.
flush().
riak\_kv\_vnode:get(PL, BKey, ReqId).
flush().

Be aware this will dump the erlang terms for the 3 riak objects on disk to 
console. Please be careful to remove any sensitive information before replying 
with the output. Please feel free to reply directly to my email if you prefer.

It would be a huge help to me recreating the bug, since it would give me 
exactly the objects that lead to this error occurring.

Cheers

Russell
