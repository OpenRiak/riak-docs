I just pushed to GitHub a small utility I wrote for doing distrubuted, remote 
logging to a Riak server. It includes a command line utility that will display 
the log lines as well as allow you to pass a regular expression to the 
Map/Reduce phase run on the server which allows you to search through log lines 
on the server.

I'll be adding other search options as I need them. I'm sure a search by date 
feature will be the first.

Hope someone else finds it useful.
