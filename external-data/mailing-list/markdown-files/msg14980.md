So, I've been doing some testing lately. Riak sounds like it'll meet
your usecases with some caveats. LevelDB on SSDs will handle change
often fairly well, as long as your disks have enough throughput, and
CPUs are large enough to handle the compaction. If you're in GCE, I
recommend using persistent SSDs only, and if you're in AWS, local SSDs
would be ideal. If your cluster can't keep up, you may see distributed
Erlang getting backed up, and that can be very problematic, as it can
raise latency for other transactions. This can be worked around by
building a Riak with the right amount of capacity. Other than that, I
don't find a workload with heavy updates too concerning.

For the second corpus of keys, I have some other concerns. It's
possible to do some of the stuff you're talking about with Riak 2.0.0
features, like strong-consistency. You could actually do RAMPs to get
what you're looking for without any external tools, or you could use
an external toolkit with Riak to get full serializability.
