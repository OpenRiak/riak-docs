But... then... i wonder how to do the following task, as i assumed
MR would be the right thing to do: 

- Imagine Facebook's "news feed",
that every little time recompile the statuses, photos, comments, likes,
etc... of all your contacts. 

Shouldn't this be done by MR? and if
so... shouldn't the user be able to execute it by-demand if they want to
refresh the news feed? ( or at least refreshed in the background every X
minutes ) and the user able to GET the refreshed compiled data?


Merci,
Rohman

MapReduce gives you full access to your object and lets you pick it
apart any way you want.
