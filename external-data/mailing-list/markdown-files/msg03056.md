Fantastic - thanks!

That's odd - in the search schema, I asked it to ignore everything
besides a few specific fields:

{
 schema,
 [
 {version, "0.1"},
 {default\_field, "\_owner"},
 {n\_val, 1}
 ],
 [
 %% Don't parse \_id and \_owner, just treat it as single token
 {field, [
 {name, "id"},
 {required, true},
 {analyzer\_factory, {erlang, text\_analyzers, 
noop\_analyzer\_factory}}
 ]},
 {field, [
 {name, "\_owner"},
 {required, true},
 {analyzer\_factory, {erlang, text\_analyzers, 
noop\_analyzer\_factory}}
 ]},

 %% Parse Name fields for full-text indexing
 {field, [
 {name, "displayName"},
 {aliases, ["nickname", "preferredUsername", 
"name\_formatted",
"name\_displayName"]},
 {analyzer\_factory, {erlang, text\_analyzers, 
standard\_analyzer\_factory}}
 ]},

 {field, [
 {name, "emails\_value"},
 {analyzer\_factory, {erlang, text\_analyzers, 
standard\_analyzer\_factory}}
 ]},

 %% Add modification dates
 {field, [
 {name, "published"},
 {aliases, ["updated"]},
 {type, date}
 ]},

 %% Skip all else...
 {dynamic\_field, [
 {name, "\*"},
 {skip, true}
 ]}
 ]
}.

(We're indexing Portable Contacts, where the user images reside in a
'image'-field.)

It's 64 (no defaults changed at all).

Four.

foreach srv ( nosql1 nosql2 nosql4 nosql5 )
echo -n "$srv "; ssh $srv sh -c 'find
/var/lib/riaksearch/merge\_index/\*/\*.data | wc -l'
end
nosql1 32434
nosql2 14170
nosql4 15480
nosql5 13501

(nosql1 is the one the error log is lifted from - but the errors
seemed to come of all of the servers.)

~17m records, weighing in just shy of four GB.

While I didn't do the loading, I believe we did it with 25 concurrent
threads, using the four machines in round-robin fashion.
