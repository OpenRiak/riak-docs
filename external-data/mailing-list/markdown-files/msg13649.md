Has anyone else had problems with a fresh install of RHEL6 or fedora 19, 
riak2pre11, and turning search "on"?


The defaults start riak just fine on both distros. But when I change 
search to "on" some of the log files get a fair amount of java related 
errors (both with java installed and not... if that matters).I went 
looking through the riak issues on github, but wasn't able to find 
anything. I assume I'm missing some kind of dependency. I just can't 
seem to find my problem or a fix anywhere.


Thanks in advance,
Bryce
