Riak Users,

The eighth release of Yokozuna is out. It is now considered alpha and will
soon become part of Riak proper. There could still be breaking
changes leading up to the 1.0.0 release which is currently scheduled
for early October.

The main things of interest this release are the re-target to Riak
1.4.0 and removal of a race condition around index creation.

See the release notes for more detail.
