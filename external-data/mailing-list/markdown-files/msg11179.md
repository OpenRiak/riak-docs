Greetings, 


Some background: I have been testing using AAE in our backup ring. I did not 
want the AAE data to sit on our (expensive and comparatively limited) SSD 
disks, so I created a LV for it on the systems' SAS disks. 


All seemed well for a few weeks. 


I got to doing other stuff for a bit, and when I came back to this ring today, 
I noticed that the filesystem used by AAE was full on all nodes. I then noticed 
that Riak had crashed on every node because this problem. 


I was not expecting that AAE issues would be able to kill Riak. 


Anyone else had this happen?
