Finished this up the other day:

http://github.com/jnewland/gmond\_python\_modules/tree/master/riak/

I'm a python n00b, be gentle :)

Here's a list of the metrics they track:

http://github.com/jnewland/gmond\_python\_modules/blob/master/riak/riak.conf

To use python modules in Ganglia, you'll need the following snippet in your 
`gmond.conf`:

 modules { 

 module {
 name = "python\_module"
 path = "/usr/lib/ganglia/modpython.so"
 params = "/usr/lib/ganglia/python\_modules"
 }

 ...

 }

Then, copy `ganglia.py` to `/usr/lib/ganglia/python\_modules/`, and 
`ganglia.conf` to `/etc/ganglia/conf.d` and restart gmond.

Please let me know if you have any problems, I'm happy to help :)

Regards -

Jesse Newland
