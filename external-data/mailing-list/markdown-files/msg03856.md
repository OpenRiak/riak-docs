They should exist on each node (server-side). You set up the code
path using http://wiki.basho.com/Configuration-Files.html#add\_paths or
-pz in vm.args for each node. Once you do that you (assuming Erlang),
you would just compile the file and put the beams in the directory you
stated in the path and then start each node and you should be good to
go. If using JavaScript, you want to set
http://wiki.basho.com/Configuration-Files.html#js\_source\_dir which
should be pretty self-explanatory.
