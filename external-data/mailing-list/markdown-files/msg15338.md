Hi Alexander,

Can you comment on the read vs. write load of this cluster/

Could you please run the following command and reply with the output?

sysctl -a | fgrep vm.dirty\_

We've seen cases where dirty pages get written in a synchronous manner
all at once, causing latency spikes due to I/O blocking.
