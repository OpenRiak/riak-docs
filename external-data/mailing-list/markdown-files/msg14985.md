Riak Ruby Client 2.1.0 is a feature release.

New features:

\* Instrumentation: if the `instrumentable` gem is loaded, the client exposes
 several event hooks to `ActiveSupport::Notifications`. Read the README for
 more information, and if you'd like other events to be instrumented, please
 file GitHub issues. Instrumentation was developed by Ryan Daigle.
\* CRDTs support the `returnbody` option, and use it by default. This means that
 unless specified otherwise, CRDTs will update themselves on a write.

Small changes:

\* UTF-8 support is now tested against.
\* RSpec 3.1 is now supported, although RSpec 3.0 still works.
\* Specs no longer use gratuitous "should"s.

The gem is available at: http://rubygems.org/gems/riak-client/versions/2.1.0
