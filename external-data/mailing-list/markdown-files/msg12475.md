Responses inline.

TL;DR - I actually agree with John, SANs make management of storage
stupidly easy, but you pay more money for it. Make the right decision for
your org, but make sure you can monitor and backup that decision. The SAN
isn't a magic box. And a Drobo b1200i [2] is definitely not a SAN.

Agreed. You can buy a glorified direct attached storage device with a few
ethernet ports in it, but vendors will call it a SAN.

We have the ability to cram 16x 960GB SSDs into the front of a Dell R720
for about $550 per drive... no SAN vendor can beat you on price for that.
SAN storage is an order of magnitude more expensive, but...

The products worth of being called a SAN offer you fantastic features like
application aware volume snapshots, multi-site async and synchronous block
level synchronization, and all kinds of amazing features that mean you
never need to think about your storage beyond "HEY THERE, MAGIC BOX, I NEED
500GB OF SPACE!"

For many applications, if you need storage performance outside of the main
chassis, you could also look at an approach like Microsoft take with the
Fast Track Data Warehouse Reference Architecture [1]. For those who don't
want to read, you line up the ability of your CPUs to process data with the
ability of your disks to produce data. For SQL Server, you assume ~300MB/s
of processing per core. Core count \* 300MB/s = total combined disk speed.
It's easy to use something like a Dell MD1220 or an HP MSA to get this kind
of performance, too, without breaking the bank and upgrading to something
like a 3PAR or EMC.
