Afternoon, Evening, Morning to all -

I guess I should know better than to wait four days to do a Recap...
Needless to say, lots of awesome stuff to relay today.

Enjoy,

Riak Recap for 6/10 - 6/13


1) seancribbs and howboutjoe had a few brief words about vector clocks in #riak

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/437977

2) Q --- Is it appropriate to ask some questions about Riak's
replication abilities in comparison to CouchDB? (from ecognito via
#riak)

 A --- Sure. Your best bet is to email the Riak list with a
specific question or give it another go in #riak.

3) Q --- Is there any way to add a link rather than specifying all
the links and saving? I have a lot of links being created
simultaniously and it's impossible for me to load the links, add one,
and save it without missing some links elsewhere. (from hassox via
#riak)

 A --- At the moment there is no clean and simple way. You can do
it via sibling-merge but that would require writing some custom code.

4) benblack and hassox had a short conversation in #riak that talks a
bit about how to clean out Riak for testing, etc.

5) Q --- Is there a way to see a family tree style illustration of a
riak object's vclock history? (from hassox via #riak)

 A --- Vclocks, while exceptional at handling version control,
don't actually expose a hierarchical history of object updates. So,
no, this is not possible.

6) argv0 and johne had a long and content-packed conversation about
Bitcask, Innostore and file limits. This one is not to be missd.

7) scootsm has been hacking away on his ruby PB client for riak.
Feedback welcome.

 Check it out here ---> http://github.com/aitrus/riak-pbclient

8) @frankcuny released net-riak, another Perl interface to Riak

Check it out here ---> http://github.com/franckcuny/net-riak

(h/t to Franck for leading the Perl/Riak charge.)

9) @rklophaus posted another great recap on his blog, this time of
last week's Erlang Factory.

9.1) Slides from Rusty's Riak Search talk at EF are available.
(Apologies to those of you who couldn't get to the slides for the past
few days; looks like there was a Slideshare issue.)
