Assuming you are using the default schema, the issue is that you are using
non multi-valued fields and thus this data is failing to index. If you
check your console.log you should see errors with the string "multiple
values encountered for non multiValued field" in them. Try changing your
field names to the following:

viewer\_id\_s => viewer\_id\_ss
video\_time\_i = video\_time\_is
type\_s => type\_ss
