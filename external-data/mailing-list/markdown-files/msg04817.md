Hi Greg,

The "install" command has been removed from "search-cmd". The new strategy
is as follows:
\* The "search" bucket property must be "true" in order for the search
precommit to be executed
\* If the "precommit" property does NOT include the search precommit hook it
will be inserted at the beginning of the precommit list
\* If the "precommit" property does include the search precommit hook it will
be left in it's defined location

Thanks,
Dan
