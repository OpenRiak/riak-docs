Via the Erlang client, 'cause that's what I had handy, I did a put/get 
combination on an object with a key 5000 chars long. Worked with no issues. You 
might run into URL length issues, depending on the client libs used, and/or the 
HTTP interface might have issues with URLs that long but I think the 
underpinnings should work with long keys just fine. Obviously, you're creating 
additional overhead with large keys -- replicas and such -- but it should Just 
Work otherwise.
