Hi All,

It was very helpful to get my first few questions about Riak/Bitcacsk
answered pretty quickly.

I just have a another question on the same lines,

I ran across the 'fold keys threshold' option in riak/bitcask.
I could not find enough information about the 'fold keys' option to
understand it completely.

Could someone tell me what 'fold keys' option is? what does it do? when
could we use it?
Does it help when you want to get the list of all keys available?

I greatly appreciate your help.
Thank You.
