I recently started looking into Riak and like many others I have relational
DB block. My questions are regarding bucket naming and organizing per
application. I have seen examples where the bucket name is something like
"articles". My assumption is that is just an example and that real world
naming would be something that qualifies the bucket some more:
myapp\_articles. So if another app that is using Riak has an articles object
then the bucket would be "anudderapp\_articles". Is this the way this should
work to separate apps, or am I not understanding something basic.

Thanks, Scott
