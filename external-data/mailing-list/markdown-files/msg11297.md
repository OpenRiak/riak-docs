Suppose I have two sources writing to the database, source A and source B.

Next, suppose A and B both issue a write to the database so they spawn two
siblings: [a1, b1].

Finally, suppose A writes another object using the metadata of the riak
object returned when writing a2. This will lead to the following situation:

[a1, b1, a2].

Upon the next read, the client will be presented with these three siblings.
Is there a publicly exposed way to establish a strict ordering between a1
and a2?

Thanks,
Jeremy
