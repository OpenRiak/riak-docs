I knew it was something simple and that I was trying to barrel through it too 
quickly. I think I've even asked this before and couldn't figure out why what I 
was doing wasn't working.

I had to go through the list of custom properties with keys like ("test") and 
turn them into keys like "X-Riak-Meta-test" and stick those in a proplist 
hanging off the "X-Riak-Meta" key.

Thanks for setting me straight. ;)
