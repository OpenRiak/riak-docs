Hi Daniel,

It should be safe, yes. If you run the `cluster leave` commands, then run
`cluster plan` (but don't yet run `cluster commit`), the output will show
if there's any violations in spreading each of your 3 copies around the
cluster. If it does provide a warning, you can `cluster clear` and backout
the changes. If not, then you can `cluster commit` and the data will be
moved from the leaving nodes to the rest of the cluster. Whether or not
you see any violations (i.e. more than one copy of data being stored on the
same physical server) will depend on a combination of number of nodes and
the ring size.
