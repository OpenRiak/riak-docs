I actually did this exact thing in the MongoDB Log4J appender I wrote. I 
haven't had time to port it Riak yet, but that's my plan when I get a few spare 
minutes. I even wrote a dojo-based front-end for it that I'm beefing up to 
include sorting entries, searching, etc... Kind of a graylog2 baby clone... :)
