Hi,

 

I am trying to install riak riak-1.1.0, but I am getting a rebar error.

 

ERROR: OTP release R15B does not match required regex R13B04|R14

make: \*\*\* [compile] Error 1

And though I added R15 like this {require\_otp\_vsn, "R14B0[234]|R15"}.

 

I am still seeing the same error :

ERROR: OTP release R15B does not match required regex R13B04|R14

 

It's like the update did not take effect.

 

Any idea how I can fix this issue?

 

Thanks,

Mohamed
