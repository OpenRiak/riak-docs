We are currently running a ring of 3 machines each machine with 12 cores, and 
have noticed that we seem to only be using 60% of available CPU ( other 40% is 
spent idle ) when running basho bench against the cluster. We have tried 
changing the 'n\_val' from 3 to 1 and also the backend from bitcask to ets, and 
it seems to make no difference. Is this expected? 

Also are there any suggested tuning parameters that should be used when running 
riak on machines with lots of cores? and if not what would you expect the 
bottleneck to be in a cluster? ( cpu / disk io/ memory / network io )
