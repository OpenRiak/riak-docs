Hello Edgar,

The consistent handoff behavior is normally indicative of a network issue
which is resulting in frequent fallback vnodes starts. Based on your
previous messages, you are handing off quite a few vnodes with 1 object so
the vnodes are not long lived. Additionally, the most recent errors
indicate a TCP recv timeout, further indicating some issue at the network
layer.

I'd be happy to investigate this issue with you. Please attach a
`riak-debug` output from this node and at least one other node in the
cluster so we can track the issue down.

Thanks,
Brian
