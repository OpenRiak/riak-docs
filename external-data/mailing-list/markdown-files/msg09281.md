Hi,

I was trying Riak's auto-indexed search on a bucket using the standard pre 
commit hook. The JSON objects that I save have title and description fields 
which need to be treated as full text search.

Problem is that I could not find how to do case insensitive full text search on 
the bucket. In the document at 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Riak-Search---Schema/ I can see 
that "standard analyzer" is what is required for full text search. How can I 
set this analyzer in the Riak key value search?

Regards
