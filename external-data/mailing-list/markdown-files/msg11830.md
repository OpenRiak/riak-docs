I've seen that the results of secondary index queries are sorted on index
values by default.
I was wondering if there's something I'm missing that would allow me to
fetch those keys but reverse sorted.

I have indexes based on UNIX timestamps and I'd like to grab the most
recent keys.
I'd like this query to be running on demand so I'd like to avoid MapReduce
if at all possible.
