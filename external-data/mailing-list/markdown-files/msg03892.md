Hello!

I know that Riak development is moving really fast right now (Riak
Pipe, secondary indexes, Riak Search integration, LevelDB backend,
etc) and Basho engineers are having a lot of work to do but I would
like to know if there are any plans on implementing these 3 things:

\* Distributed counters;
\* Geospatial indexing support in search;
\* Offline / batch processing for data.


Thanks,
Staņislavs Koikovs
