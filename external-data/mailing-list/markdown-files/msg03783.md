Jordon,

I used the ETS backend with success while working @ AOL. In my case I was
using it to cache ~100K, short lived (hours), largish objects.

I'm confused because you said you don't care if you lose data, but one of
Riak's main strengths is to do everything possible to avoid data loss.
 Perhaps something like memcached is more suitable?
