This a tangential question but I cannot get the PNG device to work. I get
the error:

Ideas?

Subject: Basho Bench summary png, what is the meaning of Latency Percentile

 

Hello,

 

at the moment i evaluate a graphics (summary.png) generated with Basho Bench
and R.

I wonder what the meaning of this 99th, 99.9th and 95th Percentile curves
are.

 

My guess is that for e.g. 99th curve means: 99% of all measured latencies
(one measured value for each node at a definite time) have been lower than
the shown value at one point in time.

 

I only have three nodes in this cluster, so i guess the 99.9th, 99th and
95th curves are showing the latency for one of the nodes in this particular
case. 

 

 

Can someone explain it to me please.

 

I added one summary picture.

 

greetings christian
