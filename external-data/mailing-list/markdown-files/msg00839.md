Hello,

I suppose I miss something important as a newbie at riak (and nosql
architecture in general), just point me where :)

I installed riak cluster 0.12 on 3 servers with no difficulties and inserted
some keys as well.

When I want to delete a key, it seams to work well too (got a 404 error when
triing to get it directly, fine) BUT ...

The key is still there enabled in mapreduce functions (with a tag
"X-Riak-Deleted":"true" added)

Am I obliged to filter on key having "X-Riak-Deleted":"true" in metadata on
each map functions I want to use ?

Thank you for help.

Cdt,
