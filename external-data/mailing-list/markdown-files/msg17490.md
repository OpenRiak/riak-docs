Salutations,

Many items to review this weekend. A number of client library updates, a
blog post and some github repos along with the mailing list review, as per
usual.

As always, we want to hear from you. Let me know if you’re working on or
speaking about something Riak related and would like a shoutout. I’ll get
your talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap.


## Announcements

 Ruby Client 2.4.0 - gzip support, connection timeouts and time
 conversions [0].

 -

 Node 2.2.0 - compatibility with Riak TS 1.3, backoff on retries,
 timeouts among other updates [3].

 Craig Vitter has started a JDBC client for Riak TS. Take it out for a
 spin, contributions welcome [4].

 a link to the repo he reviewed there [5].
 -

 My blog post on data modeling in Riak TS was recently published on
 Basho’s blog [6].

## Recently Answered


 -

 Russell Brown answers a StackOverflow question on context for Riak KV’s
 Flag datatype [10].
 -

 Norman is looking to use Riak as a session store backing his NodeJS app.
 Luke and Alex let him know that Riak is well suited as a session store
 backing but we do not have all the framework/language combinations readily
 available. The proposal is to use the memcached session store lib as a stub
 and swap out the memcached client lib with Riaks NodeJS client lib [11].
 -

 A number of folks work with Jan to troubleshoot how best to restart a
 Riak cluster in Kubernetes [12]. Riak likes statefulness between reboots.
 Some managers will bring a node back with a new name, that needs to be
 addressed. Take a look at our Mesos integration if you’re working in that
 environment [13].
 -

 Guillaume is looking to mass update all json objects in his cluster and
 update the structure [14]. Consider Riak KV is non-relational by nature and
 all values are opaque to it. Riak KV also has no SQL like language to do a
 select/update cycle.
 -

 Magnus helps Satish get Riak Control working on Riak KV 1.4.12 [15]. I
 would recommend updating to the latest version at your earliest convenience
 ;)
 -

 Luke reminds Abhinav to follow the tuning guidelines when working
 through performance related issues [16]. Ryan also points out that the
 minimum production deployment recommendation is five nodes [17]. When
 writing three replicas to a cluster with less than five nodes you are
 guaranteed to have more that one copy written to the same physical machine
 in for some set of data.
 -

 Henrik is looking for official work on Solaris/OmniOS/illumos support
 [18]. It’s true, we will no longer be supporting those environments. Take a
 look at Ubuntu’s support for ZFS if you are looking to use that filesystem
 in your environment.
 -

 In a similar request to Guillaume’s, Ricardo is also looking to mass
 update his json documents [19]. Luke links to some advanced map/reduce that
 may help get the job done [20].
 -

 Gianluca presents a data retrieval data modeling question [21] and is
 looking for recommendations on how best to proceed.




## Open Discussions


 -

 Russell and Luke continue to work with Vladyslav on sibling explosion in
 Riak CS [22].
 -

 Johnny is looking for some help on his bitcask merge issue [23].
 -

 Vladyslav is looking for clarification on the meaning of “riak-admin
 node down” [24], particularly in the face of node failure during a cluster
 resizing operation.
 -

 Kyle is looking for information on Riak TS drop table functionality and
 HTTP auth support [25].
 -

 Guillaume kicks off a conversation on custom Solr configs [26] and Luke
 points to an open issue on github reviewing some considerations [27].
 -

 Anil is looking for ways to copy Solr indecies from one machine to
 another [28].
 -

 Murali is looking for information around Riak S2 (formerly CS)
 performance on a single node [29].
 -

 Vladimir asks the list for help with the following warning “perflists do
 not satisfy the n\_val” [30].
 -

 Alex is looking for advice regarding whether or not Riak TS would be
 better suited in certain use cases over Riak KV for his social network
 project [31].
 -

 Michael is looking for some guidance on properly sizing a Riak S2
 cluster [32].
 -

 Psterk is looking for help on using hadoops’s distcpy to copy files from
 Riak S2 to hadoop [33][34].



Peace and love,
