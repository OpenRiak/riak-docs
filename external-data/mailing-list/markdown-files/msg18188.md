Hello,


I'm trying to run Riak CS on a RPI 3. I got it compiled and running, but 
now i'm having troubles.



I already changed the necessary attributes in the riak-cs.conf. I set up 
stanchion, riak kv and riak cs.


The attributes i changed include anonymous\_user\_creation=on and 
admin.listener=:8000.


I wanted to know, if there is a different way to create an admin user or 
is there something wrong in the way i'm trying to create the user.




Everytime i run the following command i get the following error:

curl -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -XPOST 
http://:8000/riak-cs/user --data '{"name";"m...@email.com", 
"name":"adminuser"}'



Best Regards,

Henry
