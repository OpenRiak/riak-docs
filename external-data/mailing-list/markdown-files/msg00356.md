Running "make dev" first will create the "dev/riak" directory.

The "make devrel" command will copy the generated "dev/riak" directory into
three additional release directories "dev/dev1", "dev/dev2", "dev/dev3". The
name, web\_port, pb\_port, and handoff\_port settings are then updated in the
three releases so each release has a unique value. It's important for each
release to have unique values for these settings so that they can run at the
same time.
