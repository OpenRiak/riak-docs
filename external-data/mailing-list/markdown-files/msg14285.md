I'm curious if anyone has done work manipulating the JInterface abstractions to 
connect to a Riak cluster as if it were a local client? It looks like I could 
basically call riak\_kv\_get\_fsm:start\_link/4 and use my own pid as the source 
(the one I'm using inside the running JVM).

What are the thoughts on using JInterface to interact with a Riak node/cluster? 


Thanks!
