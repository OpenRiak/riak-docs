Ulf is right: you ought to leave it running. The protocol is stable, so
beyond the very rare bugfix, there's no epmd-was-upgraded-now-what
reason to kill it.

Killing epmd will definitely confuse other Erlang applications running
on that node. In a previous life, in a mobile carrier data center, the
Ops folks had added a "killall epmd" thing into their processes without
telling us.

Then we started getting weird bug reports of "we stopped app A, and then
app B went crazy like \*this\*". A & B weren't inter-dependent from the
Ops staffs' limited point of view, but both A & B were Erlang programs.
Doesn't matter if they're custom apps, RabbitMQ, Ejabberd, or whatever,
just leave epmd running.
