We now believe this to be fixed in the following commit to rjc. Socket
timeouts were not resulting in permits being released -
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/commit/b8a4e7b872ae26e2c38e0ff4dd3e2d617a2c8344

The content of the byte[]s indicated that multiple threads were
reading from the same socket, and hence reading "length headers" out
of the middle of messages. We went digging for culprits, found the
missing finally block, then noticed this change downstream.

Will post more info if this doesn't do the trick.
