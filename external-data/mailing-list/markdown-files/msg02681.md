I'll expand a bit on this. We use pgsql for analytics stuff still. things
that require count ops, join ops, and things of that nature. We have
fairly large dataset,
 so those things take a while to run.

We also use pgsql also things that require transactions.

redis is really more being used as memcached++. It's fast, and don't
lose data on restart.
