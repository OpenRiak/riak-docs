I have a question about Riak search. 

I installed Riak from brew. I enabled search shortly after. And to date, I have 
been able to search without issues. (Specifically, I am using Ripple, and was 
previously able to find things in stored keys in individual records.)

I deleted my database today using rm -rf on the data directory. I stopped Riak 
before the delete, and restarted after recreating that directory with mkdir. 

Now, I cannot search. 

As an aside, a colleague installed Riak from brew and has not been able to 
search ever, so we test against my machine, or did, until I broke search.

What do he and I need to do to enable search again? Configure something? 
Sacrifice a goat?

Please help!!! 

Martin
