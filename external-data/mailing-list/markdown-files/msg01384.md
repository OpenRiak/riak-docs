I have successfully connected an erlang client to a running riak server and 
gotten some work done, but if the server returns an error response, the 
connection is dropped. A typical error might result in a message such as

\*\* exception error: no function clause matching [whatever]

Grovelling through the source code, I've tried establishing a connection by 
using this option:

{ok,Pid} = riakc\_pb\_socket:start\_link({123,456,78,90}, 8087, [{auto\_reconnect, 
true}]).

But that doesn't seem to help. Reconnecting is easy enough, but the problem is 
annoying. Has anyone else run into this, and is there a fix?

Thanks.
