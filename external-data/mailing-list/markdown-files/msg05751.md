Vamsi,

What we typically have suggested is that you use an external load-balancer
that can spread requests evenly across the Riak cluster, and that the
client connect only to that load-balancer (usually software) on localhost.
 There are many options available for software LBs - haproxy, pen, pound,
and nginx are frequently mentioned. Which one you use depends on what your
admins are experienced with and what your use-case requires. That said, I
think the multi-node support in Ripple is a good thing going forward, and
you should use that if possible. The tradeoff here is primarily whether you
want to change your Ruby app's configuration or your LB's when you
add/remove nodes from the Riak cluster.
