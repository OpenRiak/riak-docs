Hey riak-users,

I'm happy to announce the release of the Riak client for Ruby, version
1.0.0. There's a whole lot of great stuff in this release, so please do
check out the release notes:
https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/blob/v1.0.0/RELEASE\_NOTES.md .
Most importantly, it is fully-compatible with Riak 1.0 and the upcoming
1.1. As always, you can install it using Rubygems:

gem install riak-client

Or add it to your Gemfile if you're using Bundler:

gem 'riak-client', '~> 1.0.0'

I have spent a lot of time making sure this release is really stable, but
please submit any bugs or problems you find to the Github issue tracker
here: https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/issues

Cheers!
