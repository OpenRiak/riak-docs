As Matt and Jacques noted, M/R is really not intended to be used in
this manner (i.e. for multi-get), particularly if you're interested in
latency. Generally, you will wind up involving more nodes on a M/R
request and shipping the "get" results across those nodes as the
system tries to distribute M/R.
