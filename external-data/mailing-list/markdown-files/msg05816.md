What Andrew saidâ€¦ AFAIK, the only thing you can not configure is which ip 
address the erlang vm listens on. I think it will listen on all available ip 
addresses (0.0.0.0). Note that this is different from the riak process itself, 
which can be limited to a specific ip. That's at least what I came up with last 
I looked into it about a year ago. I would love to hear otherwise.
