Hi,
I setup an one-node Riak CS instance. I try to upload an file with 200M,
when doing multipart upload, I can see the disk space usage is keep growing
(du -h), as expected this object takes 3 times of file size. but after I
delete this object, disk space seems not been released. any body know why
is that?

Thanks.
Gavin
