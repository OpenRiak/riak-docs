Riak Recap for 6/22 - 6/23

1) The video of Justin Sheehy's QCon talk "Embracing Concurrency at
Scale" just surfaced. This one is about 53 minutes long but is \_well\_
worth it.

Video here --->

2) Attention all Kiwis: @robertobrien will be giving a Riak Intro
Session at Barcamp Auckland next month.

More details on Barcamp here ---> http://bca.geek.nz/

3) danoyoung had a brief conversation with seanscribbs about schema
design that might be of interest to some of you.

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/451346

4) Gist #2 for today's recap, featuring impl, makmanalp, seancribbs,
benblack and justinsheehy talking Riak over WAN and Vector Clocks.

Read here ---> http://gist.github.com/451352

5) gotascii and (the seemingly omnipresent) seancribbs had a short
conversation in #riak about read repair.

Check it out here ---> http://gist.github.com/451357

6) Q --- What happens when a node dies and all the other nodes are
doing hinted handoff, and then the node never comes back up? (from
makmanalp via #riak)

 A --- They'll continue to accept hints. It's up to the
administrator to remove the node from the cluster if it is permanently
gone. If the node is removed permanently, the hints will get migrated
to the remaining nodes.

7) danoyoung and seancribbs picked up with where they left off on
their previous day's schema design conversation (see item 3 above) and
sprinkled in a little MapReduce for good measure.
