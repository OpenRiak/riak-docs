 I'm working up a distributed development course using Node.js/JavaScript.
One of the ideas is to use Riak as a back end, and Node.js as the server
that provides the APIs. Clive asked the question "\*On Distributed
programing with Node and Riak Iâ€™d like direction on how to create API
endpoints. Mongo has a web site tool for configuring and setting public /
private data. What does Riak have?\*" here
http://compositecode.com/2013/10/08/gettingdistributed/#comments

Anybody know of anything? I'd be happy to add it to the course I'm building.

Cheers,
