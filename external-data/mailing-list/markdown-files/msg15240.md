I'm experimenting with Riak and trying out with some of our use cases. Our
basic requirement is to have better response times with low latency and
hence moving away from costly joins in RDBMS.

While modelling, for some of the mappings I can model them as muitiple
key-value pairs or use combination of Key Valu pair and index on one of the
field or using the key scans.

I want to understand which approach is better? Having Location based
queries or Indexes and Key scans?

Please let me know.

Thanks
Santi
