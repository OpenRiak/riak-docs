Hey riak-users,

I know many of you use the Ruby client in your applications and so I wanted
to warn you of the following changes:

In an effort to demonstrate that it is the canonical, supported Riak client
for Ruby, I have moved the code for the "riak-client" gem into the
"basho/riak-ruby-client" repository, which brings it in-line with the rest
of our officially supported client libraries. The "seancribbs/ripple"
repository on Github will remain the location of the document-modeling
library only, a.k.a. the "ripple" gem. The "riak-sessions" gem, that
contains Rails/Rack session stores, has moved to "seancribbs/riak-sessions".

If you have new pull requests or issues to submit, please make those
against the appropriate repositories. I will be working to migrate existing
open issues, wiki pages, and documentation to the new repositories over the
coming days.

Again, the new repository locations are:

riak-client :: https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client
ripple :: https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple
riak-sessions :: https://github.com/seancribbs/riak-sessions

My apologies for any inconvenience this causes. I look forward to your
continued contributions!
