Hi Guys,

I have a question regarding Riak's protobuffer client gen\_server 
process. I have a cluster of 5 nodes (machines), each with consecutive 
IP addresses. Our application is 100% erlang and runs on its own 
machine. The arguments to riakc\_pb\_socket:start\_link/2 is an Address, 
Port and the optional Options. The Address and Port is the address of 
the riak server, but in the case of a masterless cluster of 5 machines, 
which address do I use?


In reviewing the code for riakc\_pb\_socket.erl, the client opens a socket 
via gen\_tcp to that particular node in the cluster and only that node. 
This means that there is a 1 to 1 connection between the riak node and 
the client. Is this correct? Maybe I am missing something?


If so, then it looks like I need to implement my own round-robin 
algorithm across a pool of protobuffer clients that I am managing, each 
bound to a different node in the cluster while testing "aliveness" with 
ping/2 and an immediate timeout?


Cheers,
Bryan
