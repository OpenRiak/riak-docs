Hi All,

I am getting the following error even through the node is not a member of
cluster.
The cluster is not prepared yet. First time I ran the nodes and I was
trying to join them in the cluster.

[root@node1 riak]# bin/riak-admin cluster join node3@172.31.6.244
Failed: This node is already a member of a cluster

But when I see the membership I am only getting the fillwing

[root@node1 riak]# bin/riak-admin member-status
================================= Membership
==================================
Status Ring Pending Node
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
joining 0.0% -- 'node1@172.31.6.248'
valid 100.0% -- 'node5@172.31.15.58'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Valid:1 / Leaving:0 / Exiting:0 / Joining:1 / Down:0


I have 5 nodes, and their name in vm.arg are
node1@ip
node2@ip
node3@ip
node4@ip
node5@ip

like it is being displayed in the member status.

I only able to join one node from after onwards I am getting
Failed: This node is already a member of a cluster.

I also tried by clearing the ring data on each node . Any thing wrong?
