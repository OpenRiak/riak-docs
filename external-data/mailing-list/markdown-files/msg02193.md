I was searching for a large data set that I could use to test Riak and I
ended up using the Wikipedia Dictionary named Wiktionary.

You can download it here:

 http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/


Wiktionary contains about 2.3 million entries and it's easy to parse the
data. I just pulled out the word's title and definition. If any one wants
a little Java program that I wrote to parse the data and add it to Riak send
me a private email.
