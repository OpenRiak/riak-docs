Also note that once you add the precommit hook to enable search on the
bucket, you need to update your values because just adding the search hook
will not add the existing data to the index. I wish there was a built in
function in riak search to reindex a bucket, otherwise I ended up writing
code to reiterate all the keys in the bucket and just "touch" each value.

I do have to say that riak search is much easier to work with in comparison
to several SharePoint FAST Search deployments i have done.
