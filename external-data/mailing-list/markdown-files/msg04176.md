Hi Jeffrey,

Do you know if Mongo provides locks that can be used on clusters of machines
and in the presence of network partitions/failures? Riak could probably get
close if you created a cluster with a single node and performed all accesses
with N=R=W=1 as updating a single vnode is atomic, it's only when the order
of vnode requests can be interleaved that you get problems. Of course you'd
have a single point of failure....

Soren: It may be worth looking at a separate lock service along the lines of
Zookeeper - you could take a look at the work Joe Blomstedt did on riak\_zab
https://github.com/jtuple/riak\_zab but as the FAQ suggests do not use it in
production.

BR,
Jon.
