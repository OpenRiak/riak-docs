Hi All,
 I am using links to store my data.
 I will insert data regarding my country first and then I will
link this country to cities when each city object is inserted.
 However, It is not allowing me to link this country to cities
with out changing data of the country.


 So,
 I want to insert Country data first, whenever a city
enters we should link this country to city with out changing the country
data.
 Please help me on this.

Thanks,
Venkatesh.Y
