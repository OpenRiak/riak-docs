Hi guys,

Is there any plan for supporting more than opaque blobs as values in
the future? For example, lists, sets, hashes etc, including
server-side support for operating on those data-types?

In the meantime, I am curious about the feasibility of putting
riak\_core in front of Redis, and supporting a richer API in the layers
above (which I suspect would need to be heavily modified to support
additional value manipulation functionality).

Also, is anyone aware of anyone attempting such a project?

Cheers,
