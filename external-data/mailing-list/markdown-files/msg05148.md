Hi,

I am testing 1024 ring size 4 node riak system.
I am facing a virtual Node abnormality in which only one node has the following 
error while performing handsoff

=ERROR REPORT==== 13-Oct-2011::14:10:26 ===
Failed to merge 
["/test/riak/bitcask/689360635576978622551152123244106150872866619392",

This is creating two file every 3 mins in the same folder. The file which is 
created has a size 0 for both .data as well as for .hint.
These files which get accumulated every 3 mins are increasing the total no of 
open files by riak.
So I have to unnecessary increase the ulimit to a very big no.

ls -l of the riak data directory gives the size of abnormal virtual node to be 
954368 (4096\*233 ) where as all 1023 virtual nodes have a folder size of 4096.

Please tell me if I can solve this problem by any means and if I have done 
something wrong in configuring the system.
Also if I m bound to have any data loss...???

Thanks and Regards,

Vicky Khanna
