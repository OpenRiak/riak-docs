Hi list,

I have a bucket with allow\_mult=false, last\_write\_wins=true. I use it to
store text files (up to 1 megabyte of text). Some of these objects are
write heavy. The application overwrites them several times a minute (at
times). Now I see my dev riak node (where I'm still developing the
feature) is taking up 450M of reserved memory. Is this normal? is this
caused by the bucket/objects in question? Is it dangerous, will it start
eating even more memory, or will it auto balance itself (seems likely for
now)? How can I diagnose what is taking up this memory? Riaknostic doesn't
show anything of particular interest.
Also, what are the correct settings to be used for such kind of buckets?
It's storing data of no high value (n\_val=1) which is autoexpiring
(bitcask). It is also indexed in riak search. (btw, is the search index for
an object auto deleted when that object expires?).
