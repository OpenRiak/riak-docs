Is there a way to determine what Riak thinks is the last-written
sibling (or one of them), when reading from Riak with allow\_mult=true
(via the erlang protobufs api)?

I'm writing some conflict resolution code, which in many cases should
fall back to the default strategy of last-writer-wins, and it would be
nice to use Riak's default ordering instead of embedding an extra
timestamp in the value.

It looks like something like the unpacking of the vclock here might work:

...assuming the vclock entries are 1-1 with the siblings, but that's
not clear to me. Or maybe the siblings already come in a particular
order, oldest or newest first?

Thanks,
Mike
