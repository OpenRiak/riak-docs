On the site https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client I see the sample quick
start:

 

// create a client (see Configuration below in this README for more details)

IRiakClient riakClient = RiakFactory.pbcClient(); //or
RiakFactory.httpClient();

// create a new bucket

Bucket myBucket = riakClient.createBucket("myBucket").execute();

// add data to the bucket

myBucket.store("key1", "value1").execute();

//fetch it back

IRiakObject myData = myBucket.fetch("key1").execute();

// you can specify extra parameters to the store operation using the

// fluent builder style API

myData = myBucket.store("key1", "value2").returnBody(true).execute();

// delete

myBucket.delete("key1").rw(3).execute();

 

This sample calls 'createBucket'. First what is the difference between
'createBucket' and 'fetchBucket'? I have an existing bucket so I don't want
to create a new one and thereby remove the old one. So I felt that
'fetchBucket' would be the call I should make. The problem is that
'fetchBucket' returns a 'FetchBucket' object that doesn't have the same
methods as the 'Bucket' returned by createBucket. I would just like to query
the bucket using a key. But that simple operation appears to be unavailable
with the 'FetchBucket' object. Ideas?
