Hi,

We have currently around 53 million key value pairs and each week we would
add up with 1.4 million keys. can i use bitcask as my backend how many
nodes and ring size should i go with and how should i scale this linearly
once in 3months(will adding a node with same previous configuration scale
the riak and increase the capacity of all the nodes?)

I also want to if there is any way so that i can change the data from
bitcask to leveldb once in every three months as my old data is less
frequent to access this can help me freeing up the ram in bitcask. Any help
on this is appreciated

Thanks,
Suman Kumar Dey.
