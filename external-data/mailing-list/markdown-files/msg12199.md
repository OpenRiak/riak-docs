Summer draws to its unofficial close in the northern hemisphere, but that just 
means tech conferences are spinning back up. We know RICON will be high on the 
priority list for anyone reading this; check out the speakers list and ask 
yourself if you really want to miss a chance to bend the ear of speakers from 
Google, Twitter, Netflix, and many others, as well as the opportunity to find 
out more about the big changes coming in Riak 2.0.
