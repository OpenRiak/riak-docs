The Riak Ruby client version 2.2.0 is now available. This gem is an 
officially-supported client for the Riak key-value database, including support 
for key-value objects, buckets, bucket types, bucket properties, Riak 
Search/Yokozuna, secondary indexes, and more.

This version, 2.2.0, is a feature release.

New features:

\* Object-oriented Riak Search (Yokozuna) API.
\* Object-oriented Bucket Properties API.
\* Bucket type properties are readable.
\* Bucket-typed buckets without properties expose properties of bucket type.
\* An interface to get a preflist for Riak KV objects has been added.

Small improvements and changes:

\* In line with recent Riak documentation and implementation changes, `vclock`
 can also be referred to as `causal\_context`.
\* Support for synchronous Riak Search index creation with timeouts has been
 added.

Bug fixes:

\* Accessing a flag in a non-existent CRDT map returns false now.
\* Escaping text in situations that require it is faster, thanks to Jordan
 Goldstein.
\* Loading and storing objects from bucket-typed buckets is more reliable and
 correct thanks to Takeshi Akima.

Updating your applications that pull in the gem directly with Bundler is easy: 
make sure the Gemfile doesnâ€™t exclude 2.2.0, and `bundle update riak-client`. 
Gems and applications that transitively depend on riak-client may have a more 
complex update procedure, or it may be as simple as a bundle update. Make sure 
your tests pass before putting it into production!

Thanks to everyone who has participated in developing, testing, using, and 
improving this gem!
