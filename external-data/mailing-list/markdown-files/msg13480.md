If you’ve been a part of the Riak community for a while, you won’t want to miss 
today’s Community Hangout. Hector Castro and I will be joined by two people who 
have been among the more prominent faces for Basho for a very long time: Andy 
Gross and Mark Phillips. We’ll take a look back at where we’ve been as a 
company, product, but most importantly, as a community.

And if you saw Mark’s email a few minutes ago, you’ll know why today is a good 
moment to reflect. Hope to see you there.
