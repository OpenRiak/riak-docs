[apologies for the delay on this email sent to armon only first]

I'm having similar issues on a testing cluster for 1.1.1rc1. I'm having 1
out of 4 nodes failing multiple times and not restarting well, there are
like 100 pending transfers. Only thing node is failing. I've stopped
pointing traffic at the nodes and have attempted to remove this machine
from the cluster.
Its slowly leaving but is moving very slowly for not much data, the
metadata is important and loosing any would be a significant time
consumer(but obviously not vital since we used a day old build).
What the likely hood that pull request will make it into a deb build in the
near future or will the make file generate a deb?
