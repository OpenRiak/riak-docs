Hi Guys,

Its a great work to make search with erlang-lucene family.

I wonder is there any benchmarks withs 10M+ web documents ?

We have subseconds performance with 12M docs on SOLR. But maintaining keeping 
the system alive

sometimes a nightmare...

Can we solve our problems with riak\_search ? Any idea and experince? 

Regards
