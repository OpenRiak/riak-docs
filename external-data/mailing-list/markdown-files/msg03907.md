For what it's worth, SQL Server uses a combination of Hilbert curves and a 4 
level quad tree. If you want to implement that sort of thing, it's pretty well 
documented both in that article Francisco shared as well as quite a few other 
places. It seems to work very well for them. I've had a few clients switch from 
Oracle to SQL Server just to get the faster spatial data types.
