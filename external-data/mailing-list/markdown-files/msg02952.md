Because it's being confused in this conversation, I think it merits
clarification -- the "protocol" that is used to talk to Riak and Google's
Protocol Buffers are NOT the same thing. Riak uses a simple length- and
message-code-prefixed binary protocol, in which the complex messages (ones that
have bodies and not just the message code) are serialized via Google's Protocol
Buffers. So, while we don't use the RPC facilities in Google's library, the
\*serialization format\* DOES use Protocol Buffers.

Sorry for the confusion, we'll work to make that clearer in the wiki.


Can you mix/match access to the same buckets/data with the PB and rest protocols 
if the values are json objects? For example if you have some high-volume data 
feeds, could you write with the more efficient PB but read with more generic 
rest clients? Or does all access to a bucket have to use the same protocol?
