Hmm? The protocol seems moot, compared to inter-node comms when r > 1.
Protocol parsing just doesn't seem like much of a factor. On my laptop, I
was seeing a 3ms response time against one node. I can't imagine that
parsing was more than a few percent, no matter the protocol.

(and no, I have no specific numbers to confirm/deny my thought experiment
here)

What? Is that even an option for Riak? I haven't seen anything about that.
