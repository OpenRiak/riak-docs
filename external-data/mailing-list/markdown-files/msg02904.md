Hi Bryan/Jon,

Thanks for the feedback on the PBC API. I attended Bryan's talk at Erlang
Factory so had already taken onboard some of his requests.

We've added entries to our internal task tracker to investigate adding the
suggestions in your emails. We also have tasks logged for improving bucket
properties over PBC which is another pain point.

Hopefully the work will take place soon, barring any significant
distractions.
