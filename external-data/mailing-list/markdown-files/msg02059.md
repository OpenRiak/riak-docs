If you're looking for a fast, in memory, store that has support for ordered
lists you should probably give Redis a look-see. It's an in memory key-value
store but it has support for lists as a native data type:
http://redis.io/commands#list You could do the same thing in Riak, but you'd
be storing your list as the value, retrieving it by key, serializing it,
adding the new item to the list, and then persisting it back to the
database. I say this assuming that you want a true list and not just some
messy unordered list of values. Needless to say, that approach is not
optimal.

The key filtering approach that Alex mentioned is an in memory filter. You
don't necessarily have to provide a reduce phase. For example, if you have a
bucket that contains stock information and the key is something like
'YYYY-MM-DD-ticker' you could use a key-filter to get all the keys for 2010
or combine multiple key filters and get all of the keys for 2010 and MSFT
(there's no need, the stock price has been flat for 11 years).

I did some quick analysis, I'm not sure why it happens (apart from the time
needed to fill a buffer), but here are the results I saw when using a list
keys without streaming, with streaming, and listing keys on an empty
bucket.

 user system total real
list\_keys 0.020000 0.000000 0.020000 ( 3.254437)
stream\_keys 0.030000 0.010000 0.040000 ( 0.561119)
empty bucket 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 ( 0.664574)


My test may be completely flawed. Just so you can check it out, here's the
Ruby code I used.

require 'benchmark'
require 'riak'

c = Riak::Client.new(:port => 8091, :http\_backend => :Excon)
b = c.bucket('stocks')
fake\_bucket = c.bucket('asdfasdfasdf')

Benchmark.bm(7) do |x|
 x.report('list\_keys') {
 keys = b.keys
 }

 x.report('stream\_keys') {
 b.keys do |list|
 keys = list
 end
 }

 x.report('empty bucket') {
 keys = fake\_bucket.keys
 }
end
