Tim,

Another option along the lines of what Markus described would be to use a HEAD 
request. This will still cause Riak to read the object, but it has the 
advantage that the entire object is not returned in the response. You can do 
this with the HTTP or the PB interface. Making an HTTP HEAD request is pretty 
straightforward and with the pb interface you would use the 'head' get option. 
With the erlang pb client it would look something like this: 
riakc\_pb\_socket:get(Pid, <<"abucket">>, <<"akey">>, [head]). Not sure if this 
method works for what you want to do, but just throwing it out there in case.
