Guys,

I am trying to get riaksearch running on my local Ubuntu box where I am 
also running riak. I have edited the app.config and vm.args files under 
/etc/riaksearch. Upon trying to start the code with 
'/usr/sbin/riaksearch start', I receive the following error: "Node is 
already running!". If I stop riak first, riaksearch will start but then 
riak will not.


Is it possible to run both riak and riaksearch on the same node? If so, 
what config do I need to edit to get them to play together nicely?


Thanks,
Scott
