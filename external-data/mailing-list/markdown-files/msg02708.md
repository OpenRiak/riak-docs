Let's consider a simple scenario under normal riak. The key concept
here is to realize that riak's vnodes are completely independent, and
that failure and partition ownership changes are handled through
handoff alone.

Let's say we have an 8-partition ring with 3 riak nodes:
n1 owns partitions 1,4,7
n2 owns partitions 2,5,8
n3 owns partitions 3,6
ie: Ring = (0/n1, 1/n2, 2/n3, 3/n1, 4/n2, 5/n3, 6/n1, 7/n2, 8/n3)

Each node runs an independent vnode for each partition it owns, and
each vnode will setup it's own bitcask:


Do the redundant writes still go to different physical nodes or just 
vnodes that might be on the same host and fail at the same time?
