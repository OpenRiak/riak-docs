Hi group,

I've been happily using Riak in production on VMs for years. It's time to
scale up so I'm running performance tests with basho\_bench and my own app
code on a new VM cluster.

Here's an example question I'd like to answer: will a cluster perform
better with 5 VMs at 8gb each, or 10 VMs at 4gb each? The cost of the VMs
is the same, and I'm guessing the performance will not be exactly the same.

As I'm going through the trouble, I'll share my results. I hope this will
be interesting to other people, especially with all the changes in Riak 2.0.

I really like Riak so I want to make sure I give it a fair showing. Please
review my config and initial results below.

So far I've set up the first cluster of 5 VMs with 8gb each. I'm driving
the test off a separate (6th) VM. I anticipate I'll set up the second
cluster with 10 VMs at 4GB each in the next few days. Please let me know if
you have any suggestions.

Thanks!
Daniel

initial results:

basho\_bench riakc\_pb for 5vm cluster, 8gb on each machine:

basho\_bench counters for 5vm cluster, 8gb on each machine:

I'm currently loading records in to the cluster through my app code. After
18h and 68M records, they're still going in at 1k records/second. The
records are around 750 bytes each. They're each indexed with either 4 or 6
different 2i values. Search indexing is on as well. I'm going to use this
test dataset to compare 2i vs search for my application.
