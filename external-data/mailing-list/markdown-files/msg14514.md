Simon,

The aggressive delete code is only in the 2.0 release. There are currently no 
plans to backport that feature to 1.4.

A couple of generic performance improvements for compactions are now in the 
1.4.10 release. These improvements relate to general compactions. They do not 
speed the removal of deleted items.

Matthew
