This is a question/survey on people's approach to security and appetite for 
baked in security features to Riak/NoSQL. A typical exploit path hackers take 
is to exploit a public facing application (like the application server, of 
which there typically numerous vulnerabilities), determine the data source and 
credentials by exploring the application code and it's network activity, access 
the db and steal info. Firewalls do not help in this case since the data store 
is being accessed from a legitimate source. So, database authentication and 
password encryption on the client is pretty key here.

What are people's typical approach to protecting against this scenario? Is it a 
reverse proxy (not sure if this really solves the problem give the request is 
from a legit host)? Also, what are people's appetite for baked in features in 
Riak to do db authentication and help with password encryption and key mgt on 
the client? 

Seems like an important feature for anyone dealing with compliance.

Thank you!
Dave
