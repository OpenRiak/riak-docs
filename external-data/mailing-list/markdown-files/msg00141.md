I downloaded built Erlang successfully (minus jinterface, odbc, and
wx) then downloaded riak-0.10. I did a make all and everything built
fine but then doing a make rel I get the following:

==> rel (generate)
ERROR: Unable to generate spec: read file info
/home/mpflueger/riak/rel/../deps/ebloom/.hg/inotify.sock failed

Has anybody else run into this? Could this be related to my mercurial
install (I'm using 1.51 downloaded and installed normally using
python2.5).
