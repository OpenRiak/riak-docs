Hi Mike,

The Whitespace tokenizer (the default) is case sensitive, so the query
should be:

search:search(<<"my\_index">>, <<"title:Title">>)

If you want a tokenizer that is case-insensitive and also filters out
stopwords (basically, something more appropriate for prose) you can use the
Standard analyzer factory. Details are here:
http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Schema.html

I'm not sure why you see a range\_loop exception. That's odd. You should just
see zero results returned.

Some diagnostic questions:

- Are you running on a single node?
- What platform are you running?
- If you run the command "ulimit -n", what does it return?

Best,
Rusty
