Konstantin,

We don't support 32bit builds any longer. If at all possible, you should
try to switch to a 64bit platform if your plan is to run Riak in
production. If you do that, you can use the Ubuntu 12 package on Ubuntu 13
with no problems. If you are going to stick with 32bit, you might have an
easier time building your own package and then keeping that to pass around
to other machines for install.

The basic way to build your own package follows:

 - You will need Ubuntu's packaging scripts dch and debuild, Usually they
 are found in the devscripts and ubuntu-dev-tools packages. apt-get
 install these.
 - Fetch Riak's source code as you already did, checkout the 1.4.2 tag git
 checkout riak-1.4.2
 - Build the package with make package. This will generate .deb and
 .deb.sha files that will show up in the package/packages subdirectory of
 your source.
 - Use that package to install Riak on your machines.

I hope this helped, let me know if you run into any problems.

-Jared
