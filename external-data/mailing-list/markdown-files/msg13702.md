Hi Charles,

Within Riak buckets, metadata around size (number of objects or bytes
houses) isn't tracked. In order to calculate something like this, my
advice would be to increment another key (probably prefixed by user
ID) by whatever metrics you're looking to track at the same time
writes by that user are made.

If you're asking about Riak CS, access [0] and storage [1] statistics
can be queried via an XML or JSON API.
