With protocol buffers this is the case.

The ifNotModified() method expects you to supply a vector clock which
is then matched against the vector clock of an existing object in Riak
with that key. Since there is no object in riak ... it returns
"notfound" - it can't find it.

Unfortunately that makes your situation somewhat difficult to handle
all in one go using the StoreObject.

What I woud suggest is doing a fetch first then do the store with the
withoutFetch() option.

In the case where the fetch returned nothing, do your store of your
new object with the ifNoneMatch() option if it's possible another
writer created it between your fetch and store.

In the case where the fetch returned an object, use the
ifNotModified() since you have the vclock.
