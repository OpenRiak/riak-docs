Morning, Afternoon, Evening to All (from chilly London) -

We've got a great Recap for the last week or so. Blogs, new code,
slides, and much more.

Also, I'll be in London through Saturday. If anyone is in town and
wants to chat Riak over drinks, let me know.

Lastly, go buy a ticket for RICON EAST if you haven't done so already:
