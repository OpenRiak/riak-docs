Hello,

we are starting to use riak-ca as solution for object storage, and we see 
riak-ts as a possible solution for another aspect of or platform.
I'm installing from the centos packages, and when going for riak-ts I've 
realized that it is not a kind of overlay for riak-kv (as I expected from my 
experience with CS), but is closer to be completelly integrated with riak-kv, 
up to the point that there is no riak-ts command or init script but the plain 
riak ones. So, it seems impossible to have on the same machine kv+cs and ts.
Is it possible to run cs over the riak instance provided by ts? The riak 
version reported by the command within the riak-ts package is 1.5.2, which is 
not on the table with version compatibility ([1]) but newer than anyone there. 
Assuming that this is actually supported, can I read somewhere the differences 
of running CS with riak 1.x as backend instead of 2.x series?
I know that I could use different nodes for TS & CS, but one of the attractive 
points of TS was running side by side with CS, instead of setting up a separate 
instance (either physical or logical).
