Also I get the following error when trying to join ('node1') to the cluster:

 

[root@node1 ~]# riak-admin cluster join riak@
 

 

Attempting to restart script through sudo -H -u riak

Join failed. Try again in a few moments.

Subject: Second of multi-node setup on Azure is invisible

 

I am trying to follow the instructions at
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/installation/Installing-on-Windo
ws-Azure/. For now I am setting up two nodes. The first node works fine. But
with the second node I am not able to specify a DNS name (since it is not
stand alone). So effectively what I call 'node2' doesn't exist. It shows up
in the portal but PuTTY opening to node2.cloudapp.net does not exist (at
least I cannot connect). They both have the same public IP address. The
instructions indicate that I should install riak on both machines:

 

1. On each node, once you've connected using the steps above:

Execute:

sudo su -

 

curl -s
https://raw.github.com/glickbot/riak\_on\_azure/master/azure\_install\_riak.sh |
sh

 

But since I cannot SSH to the second node I cannot do this. Am I missing
something in the instructions?
