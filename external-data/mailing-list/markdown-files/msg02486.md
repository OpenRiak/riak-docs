Late to this party, sorry.

The Java REST client makes use of Apache HttpClient so connection pooling is 
available (and you can set TCP\_NODELAY using the HttpConnectionParams of the 
HttpClient.)

The Java protobufs client creates a connection per thread that uses the client 
, it will reuse the connection (if it is not idle for a second or more.) so you 
can create \*n\* threads and share (either) RiakClient implementation between 
them (I haven't tested this with the protobufs client yet, so caveat emptor.)
