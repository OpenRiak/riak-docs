I was following the instructions on
http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.2.1/tutorials/installation/Installing-on-Debian
-and-Ubuntu/ but it seem to differentiate between different versions of
Ubuntu. I only know that I have a Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS. Which of the
installation steps should I pick?

 

Thank you.
