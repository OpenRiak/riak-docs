It's not. We're about 80% through the 1.4 features with the Java
client. I haven't tackled the counters yet.

Provided I can get peer reviews on everything I hope to have the 1.4.0
release of the Java client out next week.

The issue for that particular feature can be found here:
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/issues/239 and I'll update
it as soon as I push a PR for it.

Thanks,
Brian Roach
