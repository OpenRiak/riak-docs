Hello,
 
Rackspace email has had serious issues, so I must have missed Alexander's 
latest post. But thanks to Russell's post, here are a few thoughts on several 
of Alexander's points:
 
I've never used slack and have minimal experience with IRC, but would be happy 
to adapt to any forum that would support serious dialogue and momentum toward 
consensus.
 
The problem is how to define and keep focus on the most immediate and concerns 
and issues. Unfortunately mailing list threads have a way of wandering off 
track.
 
Legal clarification is certainly high priority. It would be good to go through 
the Riak licenses to see what they do and do not permit. 

Even better if an IP attorney could share with the community an analysis. 
Perhaps there's a generous Riak corporate user out there willing to step up to 
the task. 
 
Here's info re: the current Basho Technologies lawsuit:
 
Basho Suit Stays On Course Despite Defense Counsel Chaos
https://www.law360.com/articles/917913/basho-suit-stays-on-course-despite-defense-counsel-chaos

This spat could go on for awhile and who knows who'll be left standing to pick 
up the pieces and if they'll be of mind to do so.

Meanwhile, many companies and developers who have adopted Riak products are 
left without support and under a big black cloud of uncertainty.

So the second, priority, seems to me, is to rally the existing community--- 
identify who and how many in the community have enough vested interest to work 
toward sustainability, continued availability, and future development of the 
open source Riak code. 

It may be little more than a holding action until the Basho Tech lawsuit is 
settled. But uncertainty has a way of devolving into apathy and loss of 
interest.

With regard to governance, it probably is too soon to do much more than define 
the options and weigh the pros and cons.

My assumption is that there are smart people with serious ideas and a vested 
interest out there. The question is, how can we best get the pot boiling?

All the best,

Lloyd

What’s wrong with the existing IRC channel?

Grow? Surely we’re just talking survival and maintenance in the first instance. 
Security for those orgs that depend on it. Growth was the problem, right?

What do you mean “encumbered”? Riak is the name of an Apache2 licensed open 
source database, so it can continue to be used to describe that apache 2 
licensed database, please don’t spread FUD.

Again, I don’t agree. Why a new name? Obviously the basho domain is off limits, 
but why does that matter, any great content on there? Or just cartoon guys?

Numerous orgs already have full forks of all repos, and all the issues copied, 
and pull request histories etc. This wasn’t a surprise.

Personally not sure of the benefit of being an apache project.
