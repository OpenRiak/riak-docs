I think this pretty much kills why I started playing with riak in the first 
place; local version of S3.

To me it seems that this is turning into another simple database, for which 
there are way too many right now. I had wrote my own storage engine prior to 
finding riak which basically stored files and made sure it was replicated to x 
additional nodes (as well as s3) and the index was stored in a replicated mysql 
database. It was my hope that this would be the replacement for that.

So, I guess I'm saying that, in my opinion, this project is going in a 
direction that no longer really supports my needs/goals. I think it has 
potential still, but it needs to find a clear direction.
