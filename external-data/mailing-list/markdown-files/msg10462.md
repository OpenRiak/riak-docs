Hi

After three months of hacking, I'm proud to announce a new Riak Scala client 
library based on Akka and Spray and simply called riak-scala-client. It aims to 
be easy to use, non-blocking, and fast, in that order.

http://riak.scalapenos.com/

This is the first public release but I've been testing it on a large project 
since January and it was time to let other people kick the tires and tell me 
what I did wrong (or right).

The client is purely based on the http API and currently it supports the 
following Riak features:

- Fetch
- Store
- Delete
- Secondary Indexes (2i)
 - Fetching exact matches
 - Fetching ranges
 - Storing with indexes
- Getting/setting bucket properties
- ping

Other features include:

- Completely non-blocking thanks to Scala 2.10 Futures, Akka, and Spray
- Transparent integration with Akka projects through an Akka extension
- An untyped RiakValue class for interacting with raw Riak values and their 
associated
 meta data (vclock, etag, content type, last modified time, indexes, etc.)
- A typed RiakMeta[T] class for interacting with deserialized values while 
retaining
 their associated meta data (vclock, etag, content type, last modified time, 
indexes, etc.)
- Customizable conflict resolution on all fetches (and stores when 
returnbody=true)
- Automatic (de)serialization of Scala (case) classes using type classes
 - builtin spray-json (de)serializers
- Automatic indexing of Scala (case) classes using type classes
- Auto-retry of fetches and stores (a standard feature of the underlying 
spray-client library)

The following Riak (http) API features are still missing and will follow soon:

- Link walking
- Map Reduce
- Listing all keys in a bucket
- Listing all buckets
- Conditional fetch/store semantics (i.e. If-None-Match and If-Match for ETags 
and
 If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since for LastModified)
- Node Status

Check it out at: http://riak.scalapenos.com/

Cheers,
Age
