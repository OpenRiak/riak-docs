So, this is technically a 'feature', in that lager protects you from
printing massive terms and out-of-memory killing your node. However, the
limit at which lager kicks in and starts limiting the message size is
hardcoded right now to 4096 bytes. I can easily make that configurable,
so you can bump it up if needed, you'll just have to be careful you
don't push it too high.
