I've been learning Riak this week, which has been a lot of fun. There sure are 
a lot of warnings in the documentation about how slow listing all the keys in a 
bucket can be. However, I would assume that it would be efficient to list the 
keys in a bucket using the implicit 2i index "$key". Am I wrong?

I would like to be able to run a map-reduce job over the keys in a bucket, and 
use key-filtering to select the specific keys I need to operate on. Since most 
of the documentation examples of key filtering use the entire bucket as the 
input to the map reduce, we would expect those examples not to scale well. 
However, since it seems we can reference the secondary index $key as a 
map-reduce input, that seems like an efficient alternative. Please shoot me 
down if I'm mistaken.

Thank you for the help!

Dave
