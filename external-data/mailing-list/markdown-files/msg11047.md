Hello All,

I am trying to implement the following functionality in Riak. I have a 
bucket where I am storing objects. One of the JSON field in the object is 
timestamp. Now I want to retrieve the objects whose timestamp is between 
an interval like (20130605 08:00:00 to 20130605 08:05:00) I mean i need to 
get all the objects from 8.00 to 8.05.
Can I implement this using Map Reduce or using secondary indexes?

Another approach I am considering is that the bucket itself would be 
created like 20130605:0800:0805 and then store the objects under this 
bucket. So now, I dont want to implement conditional time interval based 
queries. Please suggest a way.

Regards,
Sivaraman
