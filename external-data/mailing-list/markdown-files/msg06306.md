Hi Tom,

You can certainly run Riak in the cloud -- you simply need to be aware
that there is likely to be a latency tradeoff, since you do not have
direct control over the hardware and it's difficult to tune for
available resources. In addition, there is no guarantee that multiple
instances of the virtual host are on independent hardware hosts, so
you may also be (unknowingly) trading off availability.

Depending on the situation, these may not be deal-breakers -- simply
something to be aware of. :)
