I'm having problems running riak on a Sun box, system details are as
follows:

SunOS 5.11 snv\_121
Erlang R13B04 

I've tried both the package install of 0.14.2 and compiled from source
and despite building/installing correctly, when I run "bin/riak start"
nothing happens, no instance of beam and no errors to console or any log
that I can find. 

Note that other erlang apps such as RabbitMQ run fine.

Any ideas on where to start looking would be greatly appreciated.

Robert
