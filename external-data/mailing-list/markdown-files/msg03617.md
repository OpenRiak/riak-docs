Riak Recap for June 6 - 7
===================

1) jjb, Vagabond, and ericmoritz/0 had a quick chat in #riak about how
well Riak would work as a session store.

\* Read here ---> https://gist.github.com/1015798

2) Q --- Is there a simple way to reload an erlang module for
map/reduce across a cluster? (from ericmoritz\0 via #riak)

 A --- Assuming the module is in your code path, you can run
c:nl(ModName) from the erlang console.

3) The Bay Area Basho Crew moved into a new space in San Francisco,
and you should all come visit.

 \* Read all about it here --->

4) Rick Olson (@technoweenie) posted a whole host of materials related
to the talk he gave last night at the Riak Meetup in San Francisco.

\* Short blog post about the Dropbox clone he built with Riak and
ZeroMQ ---> http://techno-weenie.net/2011/6/7/dropbear/
\* PDF of his slides --->

\* Code --->https://gist.github.com/122849a52c5b33c5d890

(Also, Rick really likes ZeroMQ. You should ask him about it if you're curious.)

5) Last reminder about Grant Schofield's Riak talk he is giving
tomorrow night at the Dallas Big Data Group.
