Ok, that makes sense; but, what if another approach is picked up, like being 
able to tune this specific logging separately ? Or have the lager being able to 
log messages on different files per module/function - that way the logging 
flood would be isolated only to this...
Sorry for being so insistent regarding this matter, but it seems that post 
commits are a pretty neat feature which we're not able to use because of this 
exception/error handling inconvenient.

Thanks,
Alin
