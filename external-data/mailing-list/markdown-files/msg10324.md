Hi all,

I need to run MR operations over RIAK and I'm concerned with it's
performance. There are two points I couldn't find any benchmark:

 - Is it best to use 2i or KeyFilters (considering all keys are in
 memory)? I only found this
article
 .
 - Using Erlang functions for the phases is much better than JavaScript
 or there's no real difference?

Thanks for the help.
