That would defy the purpose of distributed and high availability; the 
short answer is no, you will have to implement at the application level 
a blocking policy for the keys, assuming you know your key before hand 
/(think if it of your primary key if it was an SQL DB)/, in Riak last 
write wins, unless you are have siblings enabled which you will have to 
resolve conflicts later, take a look at the following presentations, it 
might give you ideas; they are not necessary related to your subject, 
but will tell you why is not possible:

Hope that helps,

Guido.

Does riak have a "blocking get" call?

I'm thinking of something that works like this... if a GET call is 
made for an object that doesn't exist, the call blocks until the 
object is created.
