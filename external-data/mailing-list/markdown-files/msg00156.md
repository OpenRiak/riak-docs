Hello riak-users:

An initial release of txriak has been posted to PyPI:
 

txriak is a Twisted module for communicating with Riak via the HTTP interface. 
Written in Python, it requires Python 2.5 since it uses the yield version of 
deferreds.
Initial release was written to match as closely as possible the 0.9 riak.py 
Python module released by Basho Technologies. 

Hope others find this to be useful. 
Look forward to comments and feedback. 
--R
