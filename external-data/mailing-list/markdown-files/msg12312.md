Hi Fred -

Did you try out "curl" to delete an object, rather than using the
python library?

Also - are you using Riak search? I'm trying to figure out some of the
errors I see in the logs. If you're on Riak 1.4 or later, could you
run "riak-debug" on each of your nodes and send me the archives that
are produced?
