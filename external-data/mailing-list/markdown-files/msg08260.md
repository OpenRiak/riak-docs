Hi riak gurus,

Recently riak 1.2 has been released that uses folsom library to gather 
statistics.

Iâ€™d like to use the same library (folsom) in my application so could you answer 
the following questions:


1. Why separate gen\_servers (riak\_api\_stat, riak\_core\_stat, riak\_kv\_stat) 
were used to gather statistics instead of the direct calls to folsom\_metrics 
through some more high-level api?

2. What is the purpose of riak\_core\_stat\_cache and what it is intended to 
do?


Best Regards,
Sergey
