Thanks Luke. I don't want to increase the n\_val. All I'm worried is with
the default value of 3, with one node would there be any reliability
issues. Because there are no other nodes to replicate but according to the
configuration 2 other nodes might be expected.

Can we continue with single node and default configuration without adding
new nodes?

Thanks
Santi
