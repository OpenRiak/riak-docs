Hi Toby,

As far as I know Riak CS has none of the more advanced retry capabilities
that Riak KV has. However, in the design of CS there seems to be an
assumption that a CS instance will talk to a co-located KV node on the same
host. To achieve high availability, in CS deployments HAProxy is often
deployed in front of the CS nodes. Could you please let me know if this is
an option for your setup?

Kind Regards,

Magnus
