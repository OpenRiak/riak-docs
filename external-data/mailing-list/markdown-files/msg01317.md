>> However, you'll need to reip on all machines.

Hmm, isn't stuff like that should be treated automaticly by Riak? I mean I
have a cluster where nodes leave, nodes come. And after each come/leave I
need to do something to nodes in entire cluster to entroduce/remove new/old
node and repartion the data?

And question sounds rather strange to me, what is the node role in system
where all nodes are equal? It's everywhere said that Riak will
automatically re-balance data as nodes join and leave the cluster. It's not
the case when node becomes unreachable and cluster would repartion data to
keep it solid (like keeping n\_val for keys)?

Or something else should watch for nodes states and tell cluster that node
is down?

It's also said that:
The ring state is shared around the cluster by means of a "gossip protocol".
Whenever a node changes its claim on the ring, it announces its change via
this protocol. It also periodically re-announces what it knows about the
ring, in case any nodes missed previous updates.

Isn't cluster checking on unavailable nodes that way too?

I'm not offending anyone, just trying to make things more clear for myself.
