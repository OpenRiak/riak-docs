I understand the desire to have a better name for what you're storing in Riak 
(I went down that road myself in the Ruby client for a while), but for 
consistency's sake it makes most sense to use "object" over "entry" or "doc". 
Using something else just invites confusion when someone reads the wiki and 
other documentation and then tries to apply what they learned to a specific 
language driver. That said, there's no reason you can't build abstractions over 
the top of the object that are documents, entries, blobs, etc.

"RObject" is the class name the Ruby client uses, for what it's worth.
