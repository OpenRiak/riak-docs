Hi All,

Just a quick announcement that Mark Phillips and myself will be in Chicago
hosting an all-day Riak workshop[0] on Dec 7th. The workshop will take
place at the offices of 37signals and is free to all. Both beginners and
advanced users are encouraged to attend, as we will be available to answer
any and all questions ranging from "what is a vnode" to "how do I repair a
corrupted merge index".

We will also be in town on Thursday, Dec 6th with some free time on our
hands. If any local companies are interested in having us stop by for an
internal tech talk, Q&A or whatever, we'd be more than happy to oblige. To
set this up, shoot us an email: m...@basho.com and/or t...@basho.com

Lastly, on the night of Dec 6th we'll be hosting a drinkup[1]. If you're in
town and thirsty, come grab a drink (or 3) on us, hang out with like-minded
individuals for some good conversation.
