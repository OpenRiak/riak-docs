If you were to actually try it, you'd find it throws an exception
telling you we don't support array types with the @RiakIndex
annotation.

You need:
@RiakIndex(name = "cars") private Set cars;

and adjust things accordingly. At that point, if I understand your
question, yes - your index query would then return the keys for all
objects (including the one shown) that have "corsa" in their set of
cars.
