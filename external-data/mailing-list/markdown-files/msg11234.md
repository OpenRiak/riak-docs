Hi Shane,

Thanks for the feedback! I've added an issue[0] to our basho\_docs
repository[1] to get this information into the documentation.

If you have other suggestions going forward, please feel free to file an
issue directly against the basho\_docs repository.

I think the `riak-admin aae-status` command that provides the kind of
information you need in your second request , and there is also some 
documentation currently available for its use[2].

Hope this helps!

Kind Regards,

Brian Shumate
