Hi Shimon,

As noted in the README, the new version of the Java client (v2.0) is a
work in progress and not yet usable; while the core is mostly complete
there's currently no user API. Work on that is progressing, and we
hope to have a release candidate available at the end of the month.

The current 1.4.2 version of the client will work with Riak 2.0
preview, but unfortunately does not support the new features in Riak
2.0

Thanks,
- Roach
