Hey Norman,

 Could you elaborate on how you are currently planning to migrate and
setup your cluster? Is it in another cloud provider such as AWS or Azure?

>From a connection point of view one could access the database directly from
AppFog the same way as one would access any external (of AppFog) sysystem,
but may need to have an appropriate API or network level of security put in
place. I can elaborate more when I get a little better picture of how the
architecture is being setup.

Thanks,
-Adron
