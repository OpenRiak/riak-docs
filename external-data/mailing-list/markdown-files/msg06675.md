On second thought, let's assume you have 100TBs worth of photos. (I'm sure
there are a few individual photos somewhere on the internet that come it at
100TBs but I'm betting you don't have them).

Riak should work well for this.

\* I'm assuming you'll have a lot of keys, so the LevelDB backend is
probably going to be best for local storage. We are also shipping LevelDB
with Snappy compression enabled as of 1.1, so this will help with the disk
storage requirements.
\* Try to keep your file size under 20MB if possible.
\* Keep in mind that 100TB with a default of 3 for a replication will yield
300TB of raw data.

Feel free to fire more questions as they come to mind.

Hope that helps.

Mark
