Hello everybody,
I'm very new at Riak and I intend to really use it for the next months.
But, I'd like to create a environment first at my notebook to try it. I'll
develop a python program and want to test Riak.
Which is the best way to do so? Create one ou two VM at my windows OS or
there is another way to create this development and test environment?

thx,

Sevilha
