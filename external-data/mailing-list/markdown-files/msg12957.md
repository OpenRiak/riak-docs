Thanks, Shane!

No, it doesn't include AAE.

I'm leaving AAE off for now, anyway.

I've got ulimit at 131072 now, and that (very quick-to-run) command of yours 
shows about 32,000, so it seems we've got even headroom now.

You say you have 42,000 .sst files. Does that include AAE? If not, AAE 
could push you over the edge.
