Howdy Gang,

During our various development iterations I have had to alter the schema that 
riaksearch uses for our application's bucket. I have noticed that when I do 
that -- when I assign a new schema to a bucket -- even if I completely purge 
all data and then repopulate the bucket -- the new schema is not used. For a 
new schema to be used I have to perform the following steps:

1. purge bucket
2. install new schema
3. stop/start Riak cluster
4. repopulate

So question - is there some kind of run-time attribute I can set or whatever 
that will force Riaksearch to use the new schema when indexing data that is 
stored -- without having to restart the cluster?

Many thanks,

--gordon
