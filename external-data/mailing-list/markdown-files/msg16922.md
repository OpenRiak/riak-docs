Hi Luke,

We're planning on having a rather large cluster rather soon, which was
the reason for the large ring size. Your documentation indicates ring
resize is \*not\* possible with search 2.0 [1], although an issue I
found on github indicated it might be now? [2]

If the situation is resolved we might be open to resizing our ring
now, but given the trouble we're seeing with normal handoffs that
seems like a bad idea. Is the 4x ring size expected to completely
break Riak like we're seeing in production, or just a bit of extra
strain/latency?

I've been through the tuning list multiple times, and haven't seen any
changes. I migrated the machine seeing issues to a new host, and now
the new host is seeing similar problems. Heres a screenshot of `htop`
just before I stopped the node in order to bring our site back up [3].

Regards,
Josh
