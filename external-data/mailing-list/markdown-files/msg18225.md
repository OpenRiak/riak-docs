Hello

I'm trying to understand how Solr indexes are interact with Riak KV store.
Let me explain a bit... The Riak uses sharding per vnode. Each physical
node contains several vnodes and data stored there are indexed by Solr. As
far as i understood, Solr is not clustered solution, i.e. Solr instance
running on #1 node doesn't know anything about index on instance #2 and so
on.
Then when search request comes in, how Riak/Solr decides at which instance
they need to lookup for index? In other words, is this index is
document-based partition or term-based partition?
Thank you.
