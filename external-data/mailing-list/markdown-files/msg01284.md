Hi,

Congratulations on releasing Riak Search - effectively implementing Lucene
and Solr in Erlang is a great effort!

Since Riak Search has been in use for some time with beta testers, I'm
wondering if Basho might share some performance insights, especially if its
possible to compare customers who were using Solr and have switched to Riak
Search, which would be our use case.

For example, would Riak Search performance be comparable to Solr over say
1M 1K docs, assuming sufficient RAM and fast disk ?

Thanks for any performance insights from your beta testing experiences

Kind Regards

Neville
