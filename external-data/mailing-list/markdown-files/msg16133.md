Hey Daniel,

Is writing in this way to a single key a good idea or will I be bitten by

We call this problem a "hot key".

When you write with a stale vclock, it will generate a new sibling every
time.
For example the first time you store your object it's just "{v1}", the next
time it will get a sibling: "{v1, v2}", eventually it's "{v1,...v1000}"
since the siblings are never resolved. That data is read, updated, old
version tombstoned, and the new data written with every PUT. Based on your
info I would see about 250MB raw data there if LevelDB hasn't compacted the
tombstones away.

RiakObject.withoutFetch() tells your java client to store data without
fetching the most current value first. During that fetch, it would resolve
siblings before writing the value back. You may get better throughput by
resolving your siblings (less writes overall), or by rethinking your data
model so you're not always writing to the same key repeatedly. Is this
just a benchmark or are you modeling something in your application?

Thanks,
Alex
