Check out:

http://github.com/kungfooguru/erlastic\_search

Which is an Erlang ElasticSearch client. You may also want to look at the
pre/post commit hooks in Riak because they offer a nice integration point
(as opposed to building the index all at once).

Keep in mind that regardless, HTTP has a high overhead when it comes to
message passing semantics. We've achieved indexing speeds of about 10K
docs/sec (over HTTP) but we \*always\* using batching. I don't think ES has a
batch submission endpoint. In this case SOLR may be a better fit because
your map phase can build/submit batches and reduce the number of HTTP calls
(batching will no doubt provide better performance than mere parallelism of
single document submissions).

Of course you'll have to partition the data yourself which can be quite a
pain when you want to grow/shrink the Solr cluster (i.e., no elasticity).
Adding a batch API to ES shouldn't be too difficult. You might want to hit
Shay up and see what he says.

Of course you could sit tight and wait for Riak Search.
