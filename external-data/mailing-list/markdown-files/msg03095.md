That's where I disagree with you. We have tried to make Riak's current model as 
rock-solid as possible, and we're still improving it, but it has been difficult 
to get where we are. Adding a version history (with values, not just vclocks) 
would be fraught with all kinds of difficulties that we have yet to uncover. 
That's not to say it's not a good idea, but it feels like a very different 
datastore to me than what Riak is.
