Ahh, yes, now that makes sense. I see with @RiakUsermeta or 
@RiakTombstone it is possible to filter the results of the MapReduce for 
tombstones. Is it possible to add a phase to reduce the tombstones 
instead of manually filtering the final result?


thanks,
Michael

Michael -

You have something stored in that bucket that isn't the JSON you're
expecting when you run your second map/reduce. As I mentioned, there's
nothing special about how the Java client works; it just serializes
the POJO instance using Jackson.

My suggestion would be using curl / your browser (or the Java client)
and seeing what that is; listing the keys and checking the contents.

I notice you're using the ".withoutFetch()" option when storing;
that's guaranteed to create a sibling if you have allow\_multi=true set
in the bucket. If that's the case then that behavior is expected; both
versions are stored in Riak.

Also worth noting is that if you're recently deleted something
(explicitly via a delete operation) it's very likely to get a
tombstone pass to map/reduce. If you're doing explicit deletes from
Riak you need to check the object metadata for the
<<"X-Riak-Deleted">> header being true, and then ignore that object in
your map function.

Hi Roach,

Thanks for taking a moment to give me a hand with this. Let me try and be a
bit more clear on what I am trying to figure out. My first steps are a Class
Account:

public class Account implements Serializable {
 private String email;
}

Storing the account via

myBucket.store("key", account).withoutFetch().execute();

then retrieving it with a map reduce using JS, along the lines of:

var accounts = [];

Hello,

I have a (hopefully dumb) question about working with the Java client and
POJOs. I justed started tinkering with Riak and have created a simple
Account POJO and happily crammed it into a bucket "test1" and mapped reduced
it (hooray). The problem starts when I updated the Class for Account, adding
a new String property "minty". Now the map reduce fails for that the new
property in the bucket "test1". Seems like the POJO is always being
serialized to the format of the older Account class. If I create a new
bucket, "test2", and cram and reduce anew, everything works again.

I have been grepping around the docs, but have not been able to zero in on
my issue. Am I doing something bone headed? Is it possible to update a
bucket to support a modified POJO class?

thanks,
Michael
