Hi guys,

I've worked a bit with the Riak's post commit hooks:

1. Create a post commit module/function:

\*-module(post\_commit\_hooks).\*
\*
\*
\*-export([log/1]).\*
\*
\*
\*log(Object) ->\*
\* error\_logger:info\_msg("OBJECT: ~p~n",[Object]).\*

2. Updated the app.conf file in order to pick it up
3. Compiled the file using the erts that's embedded into the riak
distribution (which is 1.0.3 btw)
4. Started the riak node
5. Done some simple operations (get and save of objects) and I was able to
see the object being dumped to the console.log file.

For the failing scenario:
1. Changed the function a bit in order to call an inexistent function

\*-module(post\_commit\_hooks).\*
\*
\*
\*-export([log/1]).\*
\*
\*
\*log(Object) ->\*
\* error\_loggerrrrr:info\_msg("OBJECT: ~p~n",[Object]).\*

2. Stop riak
3. Enabled sasl logging {sasl,[{error\_logger\_mf\_maxfiles,
5},{sasl\_error\_logger, {file,
"/Users/alin/riak/log/sasl-error.log"}},{error\_logger\_mf\_maxbytes,
10485760},{errorlog\_type, error},{error\_logger\_mf\_dir,
"/Users/alin/riak/log"}]}
4. Recompile the file, using the same erts version
5. Start riak
6. Read and save of the riak objects, but this time, can't see any error to
the log files (especially sasl-error.log, as basho's wiki is suggesting
[1], even though I can see different kind of messages to sasl-error.log
that are not related to the failing execution).

Is it something that I'm missing, or is this a bug ?

Thanks,
Alin
