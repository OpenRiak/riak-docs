(An earlier post seems not to have gone through. My apologies in the eventual 
case of a duplicate.)

I'm thinking of using Riak to replace a large Oracle system, and I'm trying to 
understand its guarantees. I have a few introductory questions; this is the 
second of three.

Imagine I do a write, and the write fails because it could not contact enough 
hosts. Am I right to imagine that the write may actually have persisted, and 
that the data might later be available for reading? Am I also right to imagine 
that the data, once read, might later vanish due to host failure, because it 
was persisted to fewer hosts than expected?

Cheers,
John
