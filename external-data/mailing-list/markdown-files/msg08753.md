Hi,

I'm a beginner with Riak and map-reduce in general.

I was trying a function in map reduce which sorts the data and returns it. It 
works well when all the bucket key pairs in input query exist in the riak 
cluster. When a bucket/key pair does not exist, it gives an output like below.

[{"not\_found":{"bucket":"newspaper-issue","key":"56276","keydata":"undefined"}}]

I'm not able to remove this output from the map phase, even when I just return 
[] in the map phase, it returns this single object.

My question is how can I avoid this output as it is likely that in the inputs 
there is some bucket/key missing.
