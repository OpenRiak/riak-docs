Hi Marv,

I don't recall having your problem specifically, but if it happened to me, I 
would ask myself:

\* did you reip your node using `riak-admin reip`?

\* on ec2, is your security group configured to allow inbound and outbound 
traffic within the security group?

Also, by 'hangs' I guess you mean you never got to the wait complete message in 
/var/log/riak/console.log :

2012-06-12 15:58:58.199 [info] <0.18466.349>@riak\_core:wait\_for\_service:416 
Waiting for service riak\_kv to start (0 seconds)
2012-06-12 15:58:58.296 [info] <0.18460.349>@riak\_core:wait\_for\_application:390 
Wait complete for application riak\_kv (0 seconds)
