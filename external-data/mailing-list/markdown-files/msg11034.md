Heya! 

Hot on the heels of 0.10.0 I shipped riak-js 0.10.1 over the weekend, which 
fixes a bug in the protobuffs code.

More importantly though, it now sports connection pooling/load balancing for 
HTTP connections by way of the poolee library, courtesy of Andrew J. Stone.

When creating a client object you can now specify a list of servers to query:

var riak = require('riak-js').getClient({pool: {servers: ['127.0.0.1:8098', 
'192.168.1.1:8098']}})

Conveniently, the poolee library also sports a custom agent for keep-alive 
connections, which can even be used for single server connections:

var riak = require('riak-js').getClient({pool: {servers: ['127.0.0.1:8098'], 
keepalive: true}})

I'll look into adding pooled connection support for Protocol Buffers next.

Cheers, Mathias\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
