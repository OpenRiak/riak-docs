I am trying to set up a simple test environment. This environment consists of a 
single Riak KV node which has not joined a cluster. 

I can populate the single un-clustered node with KV pairs just fine using curl. 

However, when I stop the node, and then restart it, all the KV pairs that were 
written before the stop are gone. 

Is there a way to get a non-cluster joined single node to reload KV data from 
disk, or is the only way for a restarted node to re-populate KV pairs from 
other nodes in a cluster? 

I realize this is an edge case, and I only use it for Virtualbox testing.
