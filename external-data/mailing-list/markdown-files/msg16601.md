Riak Recap time. The user lists have been quieter than usual, so we will
use this round to share some other news as well. Send me feedback if you
ever have articles to share or recommendations for topics!

## Latest Releases
\* The .NET client upgraded to 2.2.0 [0]. Thanks to Luke and community
contributors!
\* Basho Data Platform 1.0.0 is out there [1] and we love to see your code
using it - share with us [2]
\* We also continue to update documentation for our open source Spark
Connector, that leverages an updated 2i query for parallel extract from BDP
[3]

## RICON!
\* RICON speakers were announced and we have some incredible ones. As a
community member, you can take the $100 off your ticket with the Basho100
code. This discount code will expire on October 31. Click here to use it:

## Community Update
\* Interested in helping people learn how to build applications on Riak or
Riak Core? You can find requests for Help Wanted in the Basho Community
Repo [4]
\* The discussion on repo naming convention and branching strategy will
close soon [5]

## Exciting Pull Requests
\* TBK15 opened a PR on riak\_core that has it compiling on Erlang 18! [6]
\* Muntasir is due to open a PR that includes his adaptive middleware that
tunes consistency on Riak KV. Read the thread for more details [7]

## Recently Answered
\* Ciprian provides Fast Track guidance for Riak S2 (aka Riak CS) [8] and
opens a ticket to address it in docs [9]
\* Outback Dingo has a few threads on setting up Riak S2 (aka Riak CS) on
freeBSD 10 [10]
\* Kota gives a detailed explanation of why sharing memory across Riak S2
and Riak KV is not recommended, but is possible [11]
\* Magnus correlates a Solr shutdown error with the need for more memory
dedicated to it in riak.conf [12]

## Jobs for Riak Users
\* Riot Games tweeted about an open software engineering position that our
community may be interested in [13]
\* We, at Basho, have opened up a few software engineering roles as well [14]

## Weekend Reads
\* Scott Lystig Fritchie continues to update the Machi documentation on
GitHub. If you're curious about Chain Replication and the future of large
object storage in Riak, it's well worth a read [15]

Have a great weekend,
