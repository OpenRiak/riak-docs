Hi,

I'd like to (at least approximately know) how much gossiping (and other 
things that are non strictly data-copying related) uses of the network 
bandwidth.


Is there any information I can lookup in logs or via the console, or 
even any experiment that I can do to measure it?


I am operating clusters in a bandwidth-constrainted environment, and I'd 
like to keep bandwidth usage to a minimum


Thanks,
dams
