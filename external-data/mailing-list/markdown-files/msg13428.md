Have the Riak Java Protobuf artifacts been updated to take advantage of Riak 
2.0 features yet? 

I'd like to work some more on getting the Riaktor (Riak async Java client based 
on Reactor [1]) up to Riak 2.0 functionality. Currently I'm using the Protobuf 
artifact for the actual objects I need to do the interactions. I'm handling all 
the network IO through Reactor/Netty and using the simple codecs in Reactor. 

If not, can I generate the Java objects I need from the original protobuf 
definitions?
