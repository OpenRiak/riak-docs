Hi Russell,

We have tried this, but it returns a reference(some number) only. We have
googled and haven't found any clue about how to use this API.
The API user guide doesn't say much about the "reference". What is the
next step with the returned reference ?


cs\_bucket\_fold(Pid::pid(), Bucket::bucket()

 | bucket\_and\_type()
,
Opts::cs\_opts()
)
-> {ok, reference()} | {error, term()}

secret function, do not use, or I come to your house and keeel you.

cs\_opt() = {timeout, timeout()} | {continuation, binary()} | {max\_results,
non\_neg\_integer() | all} | {start\_key, binary()} | {start\_incl, boolean()}
| {end\_key, binary()} | {end\_incl, boolean()}

Br,
Alex
