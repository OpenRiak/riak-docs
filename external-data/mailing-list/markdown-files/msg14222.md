Hi,

I am getting the following , don't know what was happening could you please
elaborate and explain the solution to this.

I am working on erlang-riak-client.


1> {ok, Pid} = riakc\_pb\_socket:start\_link('127.0.0.1',10017).
{ok,<0.34.0>}
2>
2>
2> Object = riakc\_obj:new(<<"test\_age">>, <<"test1">>, <<"gopi & 1">>).
{riakc\_obj,<<"test\_age">>,<<"test1">>,undefined,[],
 undefined,<<"gopi & 1">>}
3>
3>
3> riakc\_pb\_socket:put(Pid,Object).
ok
4>
4> Mapf = fun(Obj,\_,\_) -> [{I,1}|| I <-
binary\_to\_term(riak\_object:get\_value(Object))] end.
#Fun
5> {ok, [{0,[R]}]} =
riakc\_pb\_socket:mapred(Pid,<<"test\_age">>,[{map,{qfun,Mapf},none,true}])
5> .
\*\* exception error: no match of right hand side value
{error,<<"{\"phase\":0,\"error\":\"function\_clause\",\"input\":\"{ok,{r\_object,<<\\\"test\_age\\\">>,<<\\\"test1\\\">>,[{r\_content,{dict"...>>}

Please,explain where i have done wrong and what should i write in order to
get the result for test1 key.
