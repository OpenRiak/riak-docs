Henning,

This happens when the process servicing a client connection receives a
"late message" from some previous request it made to the rest of the Riak
cluster, but perhaps was already in-flight when the server process decided
to move on. They are undesirable, but basically benign. I believe in Riak
2.0, that log message has been downgraded to a lower severity (if not, it
should be!) By chance was this a MapReduce request?
