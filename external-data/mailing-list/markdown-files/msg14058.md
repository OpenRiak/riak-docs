I agree with Guido that would be the best solution for the dummies. But a good 
interim solution would be if Basho puts up a “definitive guide to enabling and 
disabling AAE” somewhere. I have now seen a lot of different commands to 
achieve this. In this thread and in the “RIAK 1.4.6 - Mass key deletion” thread 
and some older threads.

There is the per-host approach and there seem to be several cluster-wide / rpc 
approaches. I have seen:

a.
rpc:multicall(riak\_kv\_entropy\_manager, disable, []).
rpc:multicall(riak\_kv\_entropy\_manager, cancel\_exchanges, []).
z.

(with questions about the a. and z. ) and there is:

riak\_core\_util:rpc\_every\_member\_ann(riak\_kv\_entropy\_manager, disable, [],
60000).

And similar to enable.

Can someone please advise what is the “authoritative” way to enable/disable AAE?

Kind regards,
Timo
