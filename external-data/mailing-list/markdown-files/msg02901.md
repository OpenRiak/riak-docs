Hey all you Riak lovers out there! 

If you happen to be in and/or around NYC Thursday, April 14th come on out and 
talk some Riak while enjoying a frothy brew or two. Francisco Treacy, of 
http://riakjs.org fame, and I will be talking Riak, Nodejs, nosql and all 
things distributed and possibly persisted at Stout[0], 133 W 33rd between 6th 
and 7th ave. Bring your enthusiasm and leave your relational ball and chain at 
the office.

Cheers,

-Alexander Sicular
