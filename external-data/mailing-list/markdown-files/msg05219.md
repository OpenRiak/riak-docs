Hello,

We are close to production and noticed that from time to time under 
heavy load newly created objects are not available immediately after 
their creation. I'm running Riak 1.0.0.rc2 under Ubuntu 11.04. 
allow\_mult: false, last\_write\_wins: true, r: 'one', w: 'quorum'. Cluster 
of three machines with 1GB RAM each. The same situation on Joyent's 
smart machine. If there is a slight delay between the actual creation 
and the next read everything is ok.


Ivaylo
