Hi all, I was messing around with basho\_bench and I think it created a
'test' bucket with lots of binary keys, not string keys. Using the
.NET api (http://corrugatediron.org/) and it fails to delete these
keys. Any suggestions how I can get rid of this bucket, aside from
stopping all nodes and deleting the var/lib/riak directory?

client.DeleteBucket() just seems to hang and
client.Delete(bucket, key) fails with an ErrorMessage like this

deleting key ��
deleting key �w
deleting key 4�q
deleting key ��#
...
deleting key Z�1
deleting key /MN

Unhandled Exception:
System.Exception: Key cannot be blank or contain forward-slashes
