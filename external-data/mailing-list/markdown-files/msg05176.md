Hey all,

The Basho folks have been slow to integrate changes, given their busy
schedule with the 1.0 release. I've had a couple branches hanging out
for a while to deal with HTTP problems and to deal with Issue #53.
They've been separate for better review/merging by Basho, but it
finally created too many problems for my own work to keep them
separate. I've just now merged them into a single branch so that I can
get my own work done.

This doesn't have timeout capabilities (Brett has this on a branch,
but without future direction from Basho and how that timeout work
interacts with future http work, it is unclear on where to go with
developing timeouts). But if you can deal without timeouts right now,
then I would state this branch is the best option for Python access to
Riak. Since this is also divorced from my pull requests for issue 53
and fixing http, I might go ahead and add timeouts soon. Even if the
timeout work isn't Right, it would still be useful.

Anyhow, enough description. If you're using Python, then I'd highly recommend:
 https://github.com/gstein/riak-python-client/tree/proper

I hope that helps, and let me know if you run into any problems with it.

Cheers,
-g
