Hi Jared,

I'm afraid I am still a little confused after reading your reply, so I'd 
like to check something.


If I understand correctly, the reboot of nodes is only required if the 
default settings in app.config are changed, and one can change anything 
else on-the-fly?


So therefore, in the following scenario, I could issue these commands 
and never need to reboot any nodes?


Riak backend = Multi, with Bitcask (default) and Leveldb.

PUT /buckets/myBucket/myKey
# Key is stored in Bitcask

PUT /buckets/myNewBucket/props
{ backend: Leveldb }

PUT /buckets/myBucket/myOtherKey
# Key is stored in Leveldb backend


If I change the backend, do I lose any keys that were previously 
available in the original backend or are they migrated? (I'd expect to 
lose them)



Thanks for your patience,
Toby

Toby,

That particular page is talking about changing the default settings of
the backend of a bucket. In that specific case, if you want to change
the default behavior in your app.config file a restart is necessary.
 One particularly important detail there is you don't need to restart
\*all\* nodes at the same time. Restarting one node at a time is
sufficient and recommended so you don't have any cluster downtime.

For setting common bucket properties, you do not need to restart the
node. If you want to change the n\_val of a bucket for instance, you can
just change it from your client on all nodes. That page explains at the
bottom how to set them on the erlang console or curl, but most people
use their chosen client to set bucket properties before writing values.
 Here is an example using the Java Client
http://docs.basho.com/java/latest/cookbooks/buckets/. In general it
doesn't matter if your client supports HTTP or protocol buffers, both
API's support bucket
property changes.

Hope that helps,
Jared

 Hi,
 According to the docs at the following URL, it is necessary to
 reboot all Riak nodes after setting the bucket property for backend.
 This seems really drastic, and we'd like to avoid having to do this!
 See:
 http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.\_\_3.0/tutorials/choosing-a-\_\_backend/Multi/
 

 I wondered if the restart of the whole cluster can be avoided?
 Perhaps we could set the bucket properties prior to setting any keys
 within it?

 Thanks in advance,
 Toby
