If Solr is stumbling over bad data, your node's solr.log should be filled up. 
If Yokozuna is stumbling over bad data that it's trying to send Solr in a loop, 
the console.log should be full. If yokozuna is going ahead and indexing bad 
values (such as unparsable json), it will go ahead and index a blank object 
with \_yz\_err (just search for existence). If you have a case of sibling 
explosion, you'll have many duplicates of the same object with different 
\_yz\_vtag fields (again search for existence).

You said it's not a resource issue, but just to rule that out, how much RAM 
does each node have? Also, how much is made available to Solr? You can adjust 
the max heap size given to Solr in riak.conf, by changing 
search.solr.jvm\_options max heap size values from -Xmx1g to -Xmx2g or more.
