Morning, Afternoon, Evening -

A quick recap today: an IRC question, a Ripple/Riak blog post, and a
reminder about an upcoming Riak talk.

Best,

Mark

1) Q --- Are commit hooks run W times? (from howboutjoe via IRC)

 A --- No, once per successful response to a client.

 More info on commit hooks here --- >

2) Here's a link to a great, concise piece from a few days back (not
sure how it eluded my eagle eyes) on how to store images in Riak using
Ripple. Definitely a solid tutorial if you have a moment.

3) For anyone in the Denver area.... Basho's very own Jon Meredith
will be talking about Riak at the Front Range PHP User Group Meetup,
taking place tomorrow night (5/12) Oxford Hotel in downtown Denver at
1637 Wazee Street, Denver CO 80202 on the 2nd floor.
