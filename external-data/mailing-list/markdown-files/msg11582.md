As Eric said, the XML extractor causes the nested elements to become
concatenated by an underscore. "Extractor" is a Yokozuna term. It is the
process by which a Riak Object is mapped to a Solr document. In the case
of a Riak Object whose value is XML the XML is flattened by a)
concatenating nested elements with '\_' and b) concatenating attributes with
'@' (this can be changed if necessary, just ask). Yokozuna provides a
resource to test how a given object would be extracted.

curl -X PUT -i -h 'content-type: application/xml' 'http://host:port/extract'
--data-binary @some.xml

This will return a JSON representation of the field-values extracted from
the object. You can use a json pretty printer like jsonpp to make it
easier to read.
