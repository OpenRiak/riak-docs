Thanks for the prompt reply, Sean.

What do you mean by "embedded associations"? How do you create those?
For the moment I'll work with with "property :items, Array, :default => [] ".

As links are quite essential to work with Riak, do you have an
estimation when this functionality will be ready for use?

Maybe a workaround is using links in the underlying RObject, although
it's a Document protected instance method.
