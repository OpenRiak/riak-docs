Hello!

The riak-ruby-client gem was updated to 1.4.2 in the last few minutes. Release 
1.4.2 fixes a couple bugs and a documentation/usability issue.

Issues:

\* Secondary index queries against non-2i-enabled buckets/backends now raise a
 useful exception.

Bugfixes:

\* 2i Requests over PBC block forever when 0 results match in 1.4.x,
 reported by Sean "graphex" McKibben in
 https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/pull/121 and
 https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/pull/122
\* RObject#links is an Array when loaded from PBC, reported by Dan Pisarski in
 https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/pull/123
\* Bucket listing doesn't work with HTTP backend,
 reported and fixed by Wagner Camaro in
 https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/pull/124

The Ruby gem is ready to go at 
https://rubygems.org/gems/riak-client/versions/1.4.2 , and the source code, 
issue tracker, and README are on GitHub at 
https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/tree/v1.4.2 .

Thanks to all the contributors for this version!
