Also, I just found this - riak-cs-control... None of the install/config 
documents I saw previously mentioned it, or that it should be configured, or 
how. It seems to control the web interface referred to in my last email...

Where is the most up-to-date info about Riak CS and how to set it up? I am 
trying to set it up on Debian squeeze and I'm still floundering. I seem very 
close to having it working, but not quite. It's a bit frustrating! Is it just 
me, or is it complex to get working?
