Hello,

I have a bucket with about 70 items in it the Keys look like this
<<"1294549200\_UbEu1topckAFu2UYy3spr8AG5lc">> and the values are about 2.8K
of JSON. For some reason operations on data in this bucket are extremely
slow. It takes between 5 - 10 seconds to read a value of of the bucket by
it's key using the Erlang protobuf client. When I do the reads the CPU of
the node I'm connecting to spikes using up 100% usage on the Riak beam
process.

I can read data out of any of the other 9 buckets in the system some of
which have a lot more items in them (one as > 16k items) and the operations
are super fast.

There are no errors in the sasl-error.log files and everything looks normal
in the erlang.log files. Any ideas on what may cause a bucket to churn like
this?
