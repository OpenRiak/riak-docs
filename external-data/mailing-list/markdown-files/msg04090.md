No-one said you had to run it on an entire bucket. I just showed an example.

The point here is not ODM, performance and whatnot but convenience.
It's simply about replacing Javascript in Map/Reduce (wherever you
happen to need it) with a more compact, text-based querying mechanism.

You could even feed it search keys -- with riak-js it'd look like:
db.addSearch('catalogs', 'type:private').map('query', 'where
.that').run(). Not a compelling example, but you get the gist.

As I said before, I use it for ad-hoc queries in the REPL (and as you
say, for reporting).

Francisco
