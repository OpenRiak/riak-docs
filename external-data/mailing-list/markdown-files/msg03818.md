David,

given your description of the error behaviour and the MapReduce job shown 
below, here's an outline of what's happening in your cluster when you fire that 
job 208 times in quick succession:

\* All nodes in the cluster go through their keys using the filter you supplied, 
that's 208 times of going through all 75k keys.
\* Listing keys (which key filters still technically do) is a blocking 
operation, blocking the vnode responsible for a particular partition, and 
therefore, set of keys. It's an expensive operation, and again, you're running 
hundreds of jobs in quick succession, enforcing 208 key listings in a very 
short period of time.
\* Then 208 MapReduce jobs have to be spread across the cluster to the 
respective nodes having the data, each job is queued to be run by one of the 
JavaScript VM processes.
\* Then all nodes with keys matching your criteria load all the objects matching 
the key filter from their respective disks, again, 208 times multiplied by the 
number of objects that match the criteria.
\* The reduce phase is run only on one node, in your case riak01, that's 208 
times again. This is only CPU bound obviously, but requires all the data to be 
gathered on that particular node from all the jobs that just ran the map 
functions, again, 208 times.

The intention here is certainly not to excuse Riak for the behaviour it's 
showing. It's to give you an idea that you're putting a considerable load on 
your cluster. The problem is that you're also not running an SMP-enabled 
version of Erlang, therefore everything utilizes just one CPU/core, slowing 
things down even more. The process you're seeing should be beam.smp and not 
just beam. Make sure your Erlang is compiled with --enable-smp if you're on a 
multi-core/multi-CPU system.

Other things you should/could try to reduce the risk of crashing Riak:

\* Instead of rapid-fire, limit the amount of concurrent MapReduce jobs.
\* Ditch JavaScript, use Erlang instead. From looking at your code, the logic 
seams to be straight forward and should not be that hard to implement in 
Erlang. This is not a must, but you'll gain tremendously by not relying on the 
JavaScript VM, which involves lots of JSON serialization and call-outs to 
external libraries.
\* Reduce the need for key filters, or simply avoid them entirely. If you need 
range queries or queries looking for values starting with a particular string, 
which seems to be the case here, consider using Riak Search instead.
\* Spread the request more evenly across your cluster, reducing the coordination 
load on just one of the nodes. This won't help with the entire pain though, as 
it only reduces the load of the last step in your MapReduce job, so it's more 
of a general practice.
