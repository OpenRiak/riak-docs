Hi Brian,
Any process in terms of supporting pagination and row limit support for Java 
client?
We are moving to performance testing phase and I've loaded 30 million objects 
into Riak so far and Riak search is
Returning a lot of objects for wild card searches, which causes JVM to throw 
out of memory error and no way to gracefully recover from this.
Any chance of addressing this in the future? The solr API does have this 
support so I don't know how easy or difficult to add this to the HTTP layer.
Your input is highly appreciated.
Thanks.
