I'm playing with riak\_core to build a prototype. Thanks for giving such 
powerful framework to build a distributed app :) 
Looking at source code and examples I learn how to handle hinted handoff(s). It 
works really nice. But I wondered how to handle a node crash (when a node goes 
down unexpectedly for some reasons). 

Is there anyway I can be notified about node-down and get list of vnodes that 
were primary on that failed node? 

I think about an use case when a vnode was running a statefull process. When 
the node crashes I would like to restart the process on secondary node. 

P.S. The process state will be stored somewhere like mnesia or Riak :) Thus it 
will be accessible for other nodes as well.

Thank you,
Konstantin.
