Hi All,Just wanted to check what kind of configuration settings does everyone 
use in production clustered environment for Riak Search/AAE and if someone can 
share some experience over it? We currently have a 2g memory allocated to Solr 
and are currently just using the default parameters from riak.conf.  
What we have seen so far is that there is data in RIAK but somehow, Solr/Riak 
search does not return it. I am trying to find out what can cause this and am i 
missing some kind of configuration settings. 


Any response would be appreciated.  

Regards,Nirav\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
