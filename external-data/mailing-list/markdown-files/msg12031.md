This is an old thread, but I figured I'd give it an answer now, since we have a 
much better story in Riak 1.4.x. As you may know, we now support result 
limiting and pagination in 2i. You can read more about it here [1], in the 
'pagination' section. This will allow you to only buffer `N` results at a time, 
out of a much larger query.
