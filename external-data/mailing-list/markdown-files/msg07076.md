Hi,

While developing my pet project few questions came to my mind and I decided
to consult with you.

Which of them are more effective for recording relationships: Link or
Secondary Indexes?

1. Friend relationships: like Facebook friends?
2. Followed/follower relationships like in Twitter?
3. Member/Club relationship like fanpage in Facebook?
4. Like in Facebook?

Thanks,
-- buriwoy
