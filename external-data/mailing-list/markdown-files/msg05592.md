Hi Izhar,

Fredrik's suggestion for using 2i sounds like a good place to start and
will keep your riak install as simple as possible. If you name your keys
as : and store them in the same bucket, you can use 2I to
retrieve ranges of primary keys as a range from : to ;
(using the colon/semicolon is just a trick to make the ranging work
nicely). 2I queries do not work across buckets, and to use 2I you are
currently restricted to eleveldb as a backend.

Here's a small example using the riak console - apologies for not having a
small client library based snippet. It creates 3 objects, two for user k1,
one for user k2 and finds them using 2I on the primary key.

(dev1@127.0.0.1)1> {ok,C}=riak:local\_client().
{ok,{riak\_client,'dev1@127.0.0.1',undefined}}
(dev1@127.0.0.1)14> C:put(riak\_object:new(<<"b">>,<<"k1:s1">>,<<"key 1
subkey 1">>)).
ok
(dev1@127.0.0.1)13> C:put(riak\_object:new(<<"b">>,<<"k1:s2">>,<<"key 1
subkey 2">>)).
ok
(dev1@127.0.0.1)15> C:put(riak\_object:new(<<"b">>,<<"k2:s1">>,<<"key 2
subkey 1">>)).
ok
(dev1@127.0.0.1)16> C:get\_index(<<"b">>, {range, <<"$key">>, <<"k1:">>,
<<"k1;">>}).
{ok,[<<"k1:s1">>,<<"k1:s2">>]}


Here's a little more info on the million-bucket option.

In 1.0, list\_keys no longer blocks vnodes (unless you have async\_vnodes
disabled).

As Kresten said, bucket properties are only stored in the ring once they
are modified from the default. Buckets that use the default properties do
not take up space. It is possible to modify the default bucket properties
if you need to change it for all buckets by setting default\_bucket\_props in
the riak\_core section of app.config, but that does require more
thought/testing when doing upgrades.

It is up to the backend implementation to decide how to handle bucket/key
splits. Bitcask and eleveldb include the bucket as part of the key and
stores all bucket/keys for a partition together, innostore creates a
separate table so although it can restrict how many filehandles it uses
performance would suffer due to constant open/closes of the table.

For listing keys, bitcask will have to traverse all the keys (as internally
it uses a hashtable for bucket/keys) but eleveldb stores them ordered so
can do a quick retrieval (similar to how we do it with 2I). So, If you
don't override bucket properties then the eleveldb backend is the best
choice, but 200M buckets is many orders of magnitude more than we have
tested, so your mileage may vary.

BR, Jon
