This is great Shuhao! 

I've had problems using the python client using multiple threads with protocol 
buffers. The exact same multithreaded code works fine with http protocol. So, 
any attention you can give to the pbc transport would be hugely appreciated.

Good luck! Can't wait to give your new client a test drive.
