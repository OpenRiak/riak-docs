Hi list,


I've got a simple question of syntax, and I can't find it documented
anywhere. I have a working riaksearch javascript mapreduce call that looks
like the following:

{"inputs": {
 "module":"riak\_search",
 "function":"mapred\_search",
 "arg":["tub-0.3","title:Daniel"]
 },
 "query":[{"map":{"language":"javascript","source":"function(v) { return
[v.values[0].data]; }","keep":true}}]
}


I simply want to limit the number of results returned. I'd like to do this
with the 'rows' parameter into search (as opposed to a limit in the map
phase). I've tried adding a "&rows=10" to my "arg" value after
"title:Daniel", but this doesn't work.

What's the solution?
