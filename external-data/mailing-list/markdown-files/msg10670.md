I hesitate to reply to my own email, but just wanted to point out that this
issue https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/pull/281 listed in the release
notes should help all of you who had issues with slow bitcask startup times
in 1.3.0. If you see or don't see improvements let us know.

Thanks,
Jared
