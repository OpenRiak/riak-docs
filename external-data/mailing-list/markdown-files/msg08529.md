Jonas,

I'd be weary of 'autoscaling' a cluster. While it seems nice in theory, 
rebalancing
data when a node is added or removed from the cluster can be expensive.
I'd recommend having a human involved, at least until you have a bit more
experience administering a cluster.

To answer your question, yes, you'll have to write the code yourself to remove
the node.
