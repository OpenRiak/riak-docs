Hi,
For Java developers who don't use maven, I've added a download[1] to the RJC's 
GitHub repo. This is a build of the RJC with all dependencies in the jars 
`lib/` directory. It has been pointed out that the RJC is very maven focussed, 
hopefully this will help redress that balance somewhat. The current release is 
1.0.2, and I'll be adding a new download with each new release.

Cheers

Russell
