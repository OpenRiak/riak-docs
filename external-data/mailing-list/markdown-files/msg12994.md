Shuhao,

Apt keys and packages typically aren't provided over HTTPS - even by the
distribution itself (see /etc/apt/sources.list). There is no transport
security but the the packages are signed which provides a generally agreed
upon adequate level of security. There is some discussion here[1] that
details why HTTPS doesn't offer much security for this process. As a quick
pass I looked at a dozen other projects that all follow the same pattern
with respect to both keys and packages.

Cheers,
Seth Thomas
