Hi,

 When i tried to use

 {ok, File} = luwak\_file:create(Riak, <<"file1">>, dict:new()),
 Size = luwak\_file:length(Riak, File),
 io:format("Size is ~p bytes~n", [Size]),
 {ok, \_, File1} = luwak\_io:put\_range(Riak, File, 0, <<"1234567890">>),
 Size1 = luwak\_file:length(Riak, File1),
 io:format("Size is ~p bytes~n", [Size1]),
 %%create this file again
 {ok, File2} = luwak\_file:create(Riak, <<"file1">>, dict:new()),
 Size2 = luwak\_file:length(Riak, File2),
 io:format("Size is ~p bytes~n", [Size2]),
 %%write data at pos 100 which is invalid offset, but it works, why?
 {ok, \_, File3} = luwak\_io:put\_range(Riak, File2, 100, <<"abcdefg">>),
 Size3 = luwak\_file:length(Riak, File3),
 io:format("Size is ~p bytes~n", [Size3]).


result:
 Size is 0 bytes
 Size is 10 bytes
 Size is 10 bytes
 Size is 107 bytes
 ok


I tried many times and found seems like as long as i did these operation
using the same Riak connection, it will show results above. but when i used
another Riak connection({ok, Riak} = riak:client\_connect('riak@127.0.0.1').
), it will truncate file contents. Is this the supposed result?

Best regards
Fisher
