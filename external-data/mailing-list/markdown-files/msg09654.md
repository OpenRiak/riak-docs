Hi guys,

Have a question about deployment, hope you can help.

I am working on a start up project, which means very little money to start
with and no guarantee whether it is going to gain traction.

Using riak as I like the scalability and the API.

It is not a mission critical app, and writes are not too frequent, so data
consistency is not of utmost importance in the early stage.

Which of the below deployment make sense, considering budget constraints..

a) Deploy 3 nodes into a single EC2 Large (for faster IO)
b) Deploy a node in each of 3 Small/Medium EC2 nodes.

Thanks for the help.
Jimmy
