Hi,

I'm currently in great pain trying to walk through many records in my 
Riak yokozuna system. I need to scan data through many pages in Solr for 
some operation and I really feel the need for cursormark support.


I've read that Yokozuna closed a bug on that matter in may. What is the 
status of this feature in Riak ?


Is there any deep paging solution you guys from Riak suggest ?

Guillaume
