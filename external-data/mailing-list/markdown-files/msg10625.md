That's an interesting result. Once it's fully rebalanced, I'd turn it
back on and see if the fallback handoffs still fail. If they do, I'd
recommend using memory limits, rather than TTL to limit growth (also,
remember that memory limits are \*per vnode\*, rather than per node).
They're slower, but they don't seem to have this problem. I'll do my
best to figure out what is going on and get a patch (if one is needed)
into the next version.
