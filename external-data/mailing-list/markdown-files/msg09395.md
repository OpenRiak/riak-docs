Hi folks,

I've finally gotten around to writing up a PB client for PHP.

The URL: https://github.com/marksteele/riak-php
Background:
http://www.control-alt-del.org/2011/09/06/building-a-better-riak-client-for-php/

It's a full implementation supporting all the features of 1.2.1 that are
exposed via the PB API.

It's usage is similar to the official client (chaining of operations and so
on). Operations should be pretty self explanatory and there's PHPDoc
formatted comments for those that want to generate API documentation.

I haven't written unit tests yet, because I'm using the TiP (testing in
production) methodology. See
here.
Also a fan of the TTITW method (the things I tested worked).

As mentioned in the README, it's faster than the current Basho PHP
implementation in my testing, but YMMV.

Works with PHP 5.3 and up.

Cheers,

Mark Steele
