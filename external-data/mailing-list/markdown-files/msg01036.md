Hi all,

I have Riak of last version from bitbucket (http://hg.basho.com/riak/src),
 which I want to install on my server with CentOS 5.5 Final.
I executed "make rel" and all code was compiled without errors.
Then I started riak and, it seems, it was started without errors too.

But when I tried to test node I got:

myhost# bin/riak-admin test
Node is not running!

There is following errors in erlang.log.1 - http://pastebin.com/Ls0s8rXb

sasl-error.log - http://pastebin.com/DvZYy1vU

Did anybody get similar problem with Riak on CentOS/
