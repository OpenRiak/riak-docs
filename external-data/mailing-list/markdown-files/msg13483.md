How "heavy" for the cluster are those two operations for Riak cluster 3-5
nodes?
Listing all keys and filtering on client side is definitely not recommended
but is 2i query via $key for given bucket equally heavy and not recommended?

On related note is there a $bucket query to find all the buckets in the
cluster and if there is how heavy is that operation?

Thanks
Daniel
