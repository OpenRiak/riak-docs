Hi!

While waiting for some help, I wanted to try to compile Riak code with the
recommended Erlang version R16B02. On my system I had R17. So I downloaded
Basho's Erlang distribution as described on
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/installing/erlang/

One thing I noticed after extracting OTP\_R16B02\_basho8 is that configure
script is missing. I generated configure script using autoconf. Is this the
correct procedure, or the configure script should have been there to start
with?

After generating configure myself, I executed it. However, it seems that it
also expects a "configure" script under directory
OTP\_R16B02\_basho8/erts/autoconf/configure

This script is missing. My question is should this script get
auto-generated or am I supposed to generate one? If it is supposed to get
auto-generated, for some reason it is not getting generated.

Has anybody faced these problems earlier? Am I doing the right thing or
missing something important?

Thanks,
Atul.
