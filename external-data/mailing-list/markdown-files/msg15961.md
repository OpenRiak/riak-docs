Hello,
I am working for a non-profit where members of the organization have a need
to store historical data for record purposes. These historical data are
video interviews, magazines (pdfs), audio recordings etc.

Watching Riak CS Build Your Own Cloud Storage by Pavan Venkatesh
 on youtube it looks like Riak
CS can handle our need. The question now is, what is available opensource
apps that use Riak cs as its backend and gives nice ui like dropbox or at
least close to it?

Thanks,
Shankar
