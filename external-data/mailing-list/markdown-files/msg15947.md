Hi,

I am evaluating Riak for my employer and need to rename a bucket-type. I
think that it would also be useful to be able to delete bucket-types.

In order to delete a bucket-type, do I need to stop Riak and delete the
data for the bucket-type? If so, what exactly would I delete (under
/var/lib/riak)? Or is there another way to remove a bucket-type?

Thanks,
Jonathan
