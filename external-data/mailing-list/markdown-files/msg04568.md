Riak Recap for September 1 - 2
=======================

1) Basho Developer Ryan Zezeski is in Baltimore and is looking for
other like-minded Baltimoreans for talk Riak with (for meetups.
presos, etc.). If this is you, shoot an email to rzeze...@basho.com.

\* Some details here --->

2) MÃ¥rten Gustafson (@martengustafson) posted a slide deck a few days
ago from a recent talk he gave called "Approaching and evaluating
NoSQL." Riak gets a non-trivial mention. Thanks, MÃ¥rten!

4) Riak 1.0 Preview Meetups are happening in both San Francisco and
New York on September 8th. If you're in the area and already
registered, you should do so; seats are going fast.

over year now.)

wiki repo and add your details (or email me) --->

6) Looks like Duncan McGreggor has his Django Riak Engine up on
GitHub. (I posted a link to the Launchpad repo for this code in the
last recap.)
