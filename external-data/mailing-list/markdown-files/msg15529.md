Santi -

The core of the 2.0 Java client uses Netty. There's a fixed number of
worker threads that process sockets using non-blocking IO ( w/
polling/select).

Due to the synchronous nature of the Riak API, each fetch operation
requires its own socket connection and we can't pipeline.

As noted in the Javadoc for MultiFetch
(http://basho.github.io/riak-java-client/2.0.0/com/basho/riak/client/api/commands/kv/MultiFetch.html)
there is a default of 10 simultaneous fetches in flight at once. This
is pretty conservative but ... that's what defaults are for :)

How does it scale? Depends on the hardware, network latency, etc. In
the end ... you've only got so many threads and you prob don't want
1000 sockets being created at once. Best suggestion is to adjust up
the number of simultaneous inflight and measure it.

Thanks,
- Roach
