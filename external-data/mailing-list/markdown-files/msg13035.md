Roger,

Riak Search has a hardcoded max result set size of 100K items. It enforces
this to prevent blowing out memory and causing other issues. Riak Search
definitely has some issues when it comes to handling a use case like yours.

That said, our new Search solution in 2.0 (code named Yokozuna) should do a
lot better. Not only does it not have the hardcoded 100K limit but it
should also execute the queries faster. In some cases by 1-3 orders of
magnitude (10-1000x). At that point you're more likely to be slowed down by
the map-reduce. You might even be able to remove that stage by using stored
fields, but I'd need to know more about your use case.

I agree that current Riak (pre 2.0) is not a general search solution. Riak
Search can work very well but it requires some hand holding and careful
vigilance of how you index and query the data. I feel that the new Search
(Yokozuna) fixes this in many ways. In general, it has more robust search
support and lower, more consistent latency. Yokozuna would also have no
issues dealing with 1 million objects. My micro benchmark that I run is
1-10 million objects. Granted, they are small plain-text objects, but I'm
fairly confident it would work with your 1 million objects.

I realize that Riak 2.0, and thus the new search functionality, is not out
yet. We have an early release, Riak 2.0.0pre5 [1], that you can try. I also
do monthly releases of the new search functionality [2]. So if you want to
kick the tires I can point you in the right direction.
