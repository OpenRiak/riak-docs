Lucas,

Thank you for being interested in Riak CS.

create a new bucket.

That is typical observation when Stanchion is not correctly configured. I'm
afraid you didn't put admin key and secret into Stanchion's app.config.
Otherwise you just missed IP address or port number?

If that's the case or not, I admit it's not so easy to debug the config.
