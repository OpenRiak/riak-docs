Hello list,

Once upon a time, a link from one object to another was unique - you
couldn't add two links from object A onto object B. I know this as I had to
code around it in our app.

At some stage that limitation has been removed - in either the Python
bindings or Riak itself.

Can anyone else confirm this? Basho peeps, are non-unique links the
intended behaviour?

Thanks
Matt Black
