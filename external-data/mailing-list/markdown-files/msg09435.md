I'm not using Ripple, but am assuming that line of code fetches the object by 
index. 
As I stated before; since you are using Bitcask, you can't use any secondary 
indexes.

Information about 2i can be found at: 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/querying/Secondary-Indexes/
I suggest to read those pages and the ones about choosing backends to get a 
better view how Riak actually works and how to configure it properly.

Cheers,
