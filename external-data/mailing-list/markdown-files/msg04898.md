 Hi Jon, 

I'm running the 1.0 RC1 build. I'm doing a bunch of basho\_bench testing, so 
there's a pretty high turnover where I'm creating a bunch of keys and then 
running a script to delete them all. At some point I noticed that failing on a 
whole bunch of keys and observed the state I described.

Thanks
