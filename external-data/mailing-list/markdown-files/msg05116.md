Hi All,

Riak 1.0 has now been out for 10 days. It is shaping up to be a great
success and warmly received by the community -- thank you!

With your help, we have identified a few bugs that warrant a patch release:

1228 - riak\_core\_ring\_manager crashes with function clause and state of 'ok'
1234 - Mixed 0.14/1.0.0 cluster puts can fail for clusters with more
than N nodes.
1235 - vnode crashes due to receiving handoff data in deleted state
1236 - riak\_pipe vnode crash in Java client test suite
1237 - File descriptor leak in riak\_kv\_bitcask\_backend fold
1240 - Inline Field Causes Time Outs / Errors
1242 - Handoff stops when the ring is modified by fix-up modules

We are in the process of reviewing and testing these fixes. 1.0.1
should be released late this week or early next. In the interim, the
latest changes will be available in our repositories (on the 1.0
branch), if youâ€™d like to apply them directly.

Thank you for your feedback and continued support.

Sincerely,

D.
