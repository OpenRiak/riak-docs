I'd think that you could use a post-commit hook, detect the operation, and
then modify the "left" and "right" records to maintain the doubly linked
list. The downside would be that you're incurring multiple hits to disk, but
you're already incurring multiple hits to disk with an RDBMS when you modify
a table with indexes so it's not a big deal.

Erik - what do you mean by inexact range searches?
