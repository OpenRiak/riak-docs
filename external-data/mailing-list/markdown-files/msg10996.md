We're back with yet another Recap.

Big news for the week: SoftLayer now offers Riak and Riak Enterprise out of the 
box in their bare metal server hosting environment. Big news for everyone at 
RICON East or NYC environs is that SoftLayer is sponsoring the after party, so 
if you somehow can't make the conference but you're in the area and want to 
absorb the deep thoughts free beer, register for the party at Hudson Terrace.

And, of course, we're now less than 2 weeks out from RICON East, so grab your 
ticket while you can, or face several months of deep shame and regret for 
missing it.
