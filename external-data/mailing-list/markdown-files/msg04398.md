It would probably help diagnose your problem if you specified exactly
what code you were inserting data with and what that data looks like.
That's probably where the problem is.

I don't know the specifics of that riak client but you can look at
what's coming through if you run that under pdb.
http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html

First start Python in interactive mode:
$ python -i yourscript.py

then when it prints the traceback and kicks you to the interactive
prompt you should load pdb in post-mortem mode:

>>> import pdb; pdb.pm()

From there you can navigate up the stack (with the "up" command) and
print out response[1] (with "p response[1]") to see what it is. You
may want to look at the repr of response[1] to be sure it is what you
think it is.
