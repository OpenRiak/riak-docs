Hello,

I've been playing with implementing streaming support in the txRiak
library. However, I've noticed that when a map reduce error occurs
during a streaming map/reduce, Riak doesn't wrap the error in the
boundary specified in the Content-Type header:

https://gist.github.com/852270

That makes it a little difficult to write a generic parser for the
output since my code is looking for the spec'd boundary. Is this a bug
or expected behavior? This is Riak 0.14.1 on OS X 10.6.6.
