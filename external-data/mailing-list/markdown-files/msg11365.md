You got it. After pushing 1.4 out the door in a few days, we're considering
adding in support for switching out Riak Search for Yokozuna.

Your use of cURL (the most full featured Riak client EVARâ„¢) made me curious
whether or not there was support for PBC yet within your yokozuna code.
I'll hit you up directly should I run into any weirdness.
