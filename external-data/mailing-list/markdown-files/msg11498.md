Greetings,I am currently testing different NoSQL databases and now I was 
starting Riak. I downloaded and installed Riak 1.3 and was executing YCSB over 
it. But after some time (40 sec) of loading data, I got "Read timed Out" 
exception. How can I solve it? I am working locally, on same machine so my 
connection is to localhost. Is that lack of RAM that causing that? Since I am 
using VM and I only have 2GB RAM for it. Or it is something else I can 
configure?
Regards, Veronika \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
