Hi,
I want to store a list and append item to it later. Is it suitable to do this 
in riak?My scheme is like this:
 message: bucket of all messages; message/\_meta: an object to store the 
first index and last index of list; message/n: key of message, such as 
message/1, message/2, ...
I have never used key-value DB, and had no idea how to model. Any suggestion 
would be appreciated!
