Hi,

I'm interested in packaging riak for Gentoo Linux but I'm running in
some troubles having a clean build of riak (I'm not used to erlang
building tbh) so I'll start with a few questions if I may.

1/ Is there a more detailed article I failed to find about how to build
"properly" riak (I mean like choosing the target installation
directories etc) ? [1]

2/ Why are you not using system-wide nspr/spidermonkey libraries instead
of bundling them ? Is there a way somewhere to specify we want to use
the system ones at build time ?

3/ Installation instructions says "Riak requires Erlang R14B03 or
later." but when trying to get it working with R14B04 it failed. You may
want to adjust your regular expression in rebar.config to at least
R14B0[234].

Thanks in advance for your answers and help.

Regards,
