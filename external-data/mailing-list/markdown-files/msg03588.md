Riak Recap for June 3 - 5
===================

1 - Scott M. Likens (@scottmlikens) has been doing a great job
maintaining and refining the Engine Yard App Cloud Recipes for Riak
and Riak Search and just recently moved them into the official Engine
Yard Cloud Recipes repo on GitHub.

Check them out there ---> https://github.com/engineyard/ey-cloud-recipes

Thanks, Scott!

2) Last reminder for tomorrow night's San Francisco Riak Meetup.

Riak MapReduce" talk he just delivered at Berlin Buzzwords.

4) Adam Schepis (@aschepis) published a short and very useful blog
post on how to get a 3 node Riak cluster running on EC2 Cluster
Compute instances.

Thanks, Adam!

5) For anyone who is already at or heading to Erlang Factory London:
Basho will be there in the form of Antony Falco (@antonyfalco), Scott
L. Fritchie (@slfritchie), and Russell Brown (@russelldb). If you're
interested in chatting about Riak, Erlang, cycling, Japanese cuisine,
or fine cocktails (or all of the above), pick one of their Twitter
handles at random and get in touch.
