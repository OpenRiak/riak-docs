Hi,

We have Riak cluster running 1.1.2. All the nodes own 6.6% of partitions,
still memory usage of "beam" process on some nodes is less than the others
(significantly). The number of keys on the nodes consuming less memory is
also fewer.

Then how come they still own the equal number of partitions as the other
nodes? Would it be because some partitions are empty? Any suggestions.


Cheers

Nitish
