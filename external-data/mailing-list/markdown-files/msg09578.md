Hi all,

Is there a way to tell the riak-java-client to not store attributes with 
a null value into riak? I currently have a json object looking like this:


{"status":1,
"type":8,
"content":"some text",
"receiver":17542,
"sender":317825,
"creationTime":1290565802000,
"answered":false,
"contentPath":null,
"refValue":null,
"countOrAmountValue":null,
"subType":0}

which is derived from a POJO with these attributes. Note three values 
are "null" and I would like to not store them into riak to save space.


Anyone?
