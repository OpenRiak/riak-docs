Hi, Wilson.

There are many sets out there. Which ones suit you best depends a lot
on what you plan on saying in your talk. If you tell us a bit about
the audience, the event, and what you hope to get across in your talk,
then I bet that one of the people here who has given a Riak talk will
have material useful for you to crib from.

Cheers,

-Justin
