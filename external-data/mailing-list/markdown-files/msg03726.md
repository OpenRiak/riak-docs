I don't see any reason to only restore one node of your cluster.
That is the whole point of a replicated datastore. If you loose a node, 
you shrug, replace it with a new one and go about your business.

But we expect something different in the case where a value was 
updated and the more current value is available on other nodes. 
Restoring an old value don't matter then.

Or any data from backup? :-)

 Yes, but the same is true if you restore a relational DB from 
backup :-D

 Btw, this whole issue is not really Riak specific. It is
 essentially a
 consequence of eventual consistency, where you have to make
 a trade off
 between the amount of bookkeeping information you want to
 store and the
 maximum amount of time (or number of updates) any part of
 the system can
 diverge from the rest of the system before you get undesired
 results.


 The 'eventual consistency' description makes you think the
 system will eventually fix itself, though. But, won't you have a
 similar scenario - and even more difficult to fix - where for
 one reason or another you need to restore a backed up bitcask
 file that contains items deleted after the time the backup 
was done?
