Hi I'm very new to Riak. The allow\_mult = true / Siblings feature is
very interesting. Could it be used to implement a high performance
collection like a Queue or Set, in a lock free manner? The Riak docs
make it sound like allow\_mult is mainly for confict resolution and
degenerate cases, rather than a feature which a data structure could
be designed around. Does anyone have any links to share, or thoughts
about this broader issue?
Thanks much!
Alex
