Alexander,

> 1. Does it support wildcards in a middle or start? \*abc, a\*bc,

Riak Search 2.0 (Yokozuna) is based on Apache Solr. Any queries
supported by Solr's distributed search are supported by Search
2.0 over HTTP. The PB API has not been altered for Search 2.0 (with
the exception of presort) so if you want to use features like facets
you'll have to use HTTP for now.

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Apache+Solr+Reference+Guide

For wildcard searches in particular see the following section:

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Standard+Query+Parser#TheStandardQueryParser-SpecifyingTermsfortheStandardQueryParser

> 2. Does presort supports any field instead of key or score?

There is no presort option for Search 2.0. Presort is a work around
for sorting issues in the current Search [1,2]. Solr sorts
properly. Although, depending on the fields sorted, the results can
become inconsistent for the same query over time because of a bug in
Search 2.0 [3].

> I'm not found this in 2.0 docs.

These are the Riak Search 2.0.0beta1 docs.
