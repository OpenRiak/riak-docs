riak.conf is generated by the cuttlefish extension, which apparently
does not have control for environment variables [1], so, I don't
believe there is a way to do this out of the box. However, you could
modify the schema files to add this cuttlefish transformation [2], if
you want to, or you could call the Riak initialization commands with
the EPMD environment variable set.
