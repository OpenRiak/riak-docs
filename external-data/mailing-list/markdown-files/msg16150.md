Unfortunately (not reallyâ€¦) the I/O has now stopped. Looking at the CPU usage 
and load graphs in New Relic it seems the high I/O stopped about two hours ago. 
I will see if I find anything unusual in the Riak logging around that time and 
post it. Otherwise Iâ€™m just happy that Riak is behaving normal (just like the 
other nodes).
