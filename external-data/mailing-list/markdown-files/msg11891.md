Hello all,

Is there any way to determine progress/percent complete?

This has been running for 3 days now. I figured it would finish over the
weekend but it hasn't.

# riak-admin restore riak@ riak
/var/lib/riak/backups/all\_nodes.20130725.bak
Restoring from '/var/lib/riak/backups/all\_nodes.20130725.bak' to cluster to
which 'riak@ belongs.

I'm reluctant to kill it. It could be nearly complete OR it could be 3 more
days from finishing. The alternative is to clear my Riak cluster and
re-import/ETL the data from scratch, which takes at least 5 days.

In addition to determining progress for "restore", I'm also interested in
determining progress for "backup".

Thanks for the help.

Kind regards,
