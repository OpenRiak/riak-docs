Thanks Guido. While great advice, those tuning tips seems to cover a limited
amount of optimization mainly OS based. If also found the configuration
files doc's
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.2.0/references/Configuration-Files/) but I am
uncertain of which parameters should I be modifying and to which values.

One last question, given the size of data I am pushing into Riak (< 1kb per
record) it appears to be it would be a good idea to disable Nable's
Algorithm;
 1) Are my thoughts correct?
 2) I cant seem to find the [disable\_pb\_nagle] flag anywhere in the config
file, is that expected because I am supposed to add it?

Thanks again.
