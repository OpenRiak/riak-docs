Except that the comparison was not memcache vs leveldb, it was memcache
vs Riak. Yes, Riak does impose some overhead, but on the other hand, I
don't see anything about scaling LMDB to more nodes as your dataset grows,
which was one of the goals listed in the original email.

Also, if you think Erlang is an intepreted language, you probably need
to look again.
