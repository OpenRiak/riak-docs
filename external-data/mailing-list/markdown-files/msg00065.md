Hi,

What is or is there a maximum key length in Riak? Either natively or 
in the HTTP interface?


My use case is keeping inheritance in it's own key so for example, I 
have two keys, "A" and "B" and I want to keep a third key "A,B". You 
see that the key length is a function of member key size times number 
of members. Knowing length would give me an aproximation of depth.


Thank you,
Alexander
