Hi Allen,

When generating a release package with rebar the intention is to create a
fully independent release package that runs without any external
dependencies. During the release generation rebar will analyze the
specification of an application to determine dependencies. The tool will
then collect all the dependencies (including those from the system level
Erlang installation) and package them into a release. Tsung is not part of
the riak dependency specification and should not be pulled into the release.
My guess is that macports has configured Erlang in such a way that the Tsung
library is included in all releases. We have to look into this a bit further
and try to reproduce the issue locally.

Thanks,
Dan
