Ha, I already busted the database.

But then, I tried to reproduce it again, and yeah, you can just put
again, and the hook seems to be created properly, and now I can
delete the objects. But the index does not seem to be correct.
I have a list of 6 users, and when I search with the field userid, 
4 return correctly, 2 return an empty result. It seems like
the two json docs have not been indexed for that specific
field. However, other fields have been indexed, and search
returns proper result.

When I remove all objects in the bucket, and re-create them,
all seem correct now.

Thanks

Xiaopong
