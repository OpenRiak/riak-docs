Without knowing the exact internals of Riak Search, most of Riak uses log 
structured hash trees. When an "update" occurs, a new copy of the data is 
written. Eventually, during a compaction process, the dead records are cleaned 
up. There are rules for how often compactions run. You can change some of those 
settings for Riak Search: 
http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Operations-and-Troubleshooting.html

You can think of this as being similar to the ghost record clean up/vacuum 
process that runs in your favorite RDMBS (as long as that RDBMS implements some 
form of MVCC).
