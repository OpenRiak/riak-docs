Hey guys,

I've been successfully running component tests where I launch two Riak nodes
on the same computer and join them.

I'm trying to update my Riak version 0.12, but as soon as I join the nodes I
get a \*system\_memory\_high\_watermark \*alarm and then both Riak instances
crash.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a workaround?

And yes, the nodes have different names.

Thanks,
Mike
