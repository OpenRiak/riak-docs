Interesting. Are there any benefits to maintaining the json version of the
map reduce definition for the pb client? If the erlang version of the
mapreduce definition offers a superset of the json functionality, couldn't
it simply replace the json version?

Thoughts?

I guess one downside would be not being able to share the code with the http
version of the client. (But this is begs the question of why ultimately to
have the http client for anything but calls the pb client doesn't support).

As an aside, I ran across your alternative ideas around a cleaner riak
client api and on first glance it definitely looks more usable.

I have to run off but will drill into this on Monday. Thanks again for your
help!

Jacques
