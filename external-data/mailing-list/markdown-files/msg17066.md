Hi,

I couldnâ€™t find this anywhere in the docs: is there a mechanism in Riak to 
fetch only one Register (or a specific entry) from a map?
We have a use case where we have a map and need to only get the value for a key 
in the map, rather than the whole map, and I would rather not transfer the 
entire thing on the client.

Cheers
Cos
