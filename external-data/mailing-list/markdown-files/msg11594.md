Since the data he is requiring to store is only "transient", would it 
make sense to set N=2 for performance? Or will N=2 have the opposite 
effect due to amount of nodes having such replica?

Kumar,

We have a few customers who use the memory backend. The first example 
I could find (with the help of our CSE team) uses the memory backend 
on 8 machines with 12gb of ram each.


I know you are just testing right now, but we'd suggest using 5 node 
minimum. With N=3 on a 3-node cluster you could be writing multiple 
replicas to the same machine.


Good luck in your testing,
-Jared

 Are there known production installation of riak that uses
 riak\_kv\_memory\_backend. We have a need to store transient data
 just in
 memory ( never hitting persistent store). I'm testing riak on aws
 with 3
 node cluster and looks good so far. Just wanted to find out what
 kind of
 setup people are using in production.

 Thanks
