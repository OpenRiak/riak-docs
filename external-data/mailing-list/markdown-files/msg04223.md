This isn't really about scenarios in general, just the example you gave:

 Riak has no real notion of "primary" node(s), and you don't want to change
that. (Though I guess the first node in the preference list for a given hash
could be considered the "most primary"... but that's a bit different.)
Anyway, you should be able to achieve strong consistency (read your last
write) by keeping R + W > N. You shouldn't think of Riak in "master slave"
terms you may be used to from your relational database of choice.
