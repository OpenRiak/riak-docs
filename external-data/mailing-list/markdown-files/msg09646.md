Hi, Chenini. Do you happen to have a ".erlang" file in your home
directory? I know there are some tutorials that have the reader create
this file early on, but then quickly forget it. The content of that
file is run every time the Erlang VM starts, and this has been known
to cause problems with Riak startup.
