Hi Jaques,

Where to start...hm.

This is a bug in the pb interface of Riak that I have patched and will be in 
master soon. The error is because the {not\_found} term you see in the log is 
not able to be serialised to JSON. The fix is here 
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/103

However, this error just means that your bucket/key combo 
<<"dGVzdDI=">>,<<"dGVzdEtleQ==">> is not found. Which is another problem all 
together.

Are you're bucket and key names actual binary values, or base64 encoded binary 
values?

Cheers

Russell
