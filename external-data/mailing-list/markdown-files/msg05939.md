Hi Anthony,

Thanks for your reaction.

As we have a somewhat different structure (multiple sites with multiple data 
stores) I think that we keep to our home-grown Dynamo ring software.
(It is simple enough to write in Erlang...)

I will, however, borrow some code from Riak, think of stats etc. 
And hope to add an adaptor where other users can plug Riak for their own data 
store.

What kind of C database backend did you use?

After some benchmarking we think that in our case (many more reads than writes) 
sqlite3, PostgreSQL and MySQL will do fine.


Groeten,

Marc
