Hey all,

Here's what I'm seeing: I have four nodes A, B, C, and D. I'm loading lots
of data into node A, which is being distributed evenly across the nodes. If
I physically reboot node D, all my HTTP calls time out, and `riak-admin
ringready` complains that not all nodes are up. Is this intended behavior?
 Is there a configuration option I can set so it fails more gracefully?
