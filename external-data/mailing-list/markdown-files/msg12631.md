Hi, I'm curious what Erlang shell within riak is used for (one which
appears with "riak attach" command) and if cluster operator would be
able to use it to make small queries without need to build client
application? And is there some kind of documentation for it? I've tried
to use same functions as Erlang client assuming that this shell is just
build-in interface; however, it throw undefined function exception at
me, so probably I was wrong.
