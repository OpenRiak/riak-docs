Hi,

Anyone here that knows a lot regarding LevelDB?

We have played around with LevelDB and found that when you
accesses items that have existed but now are deleted, then
the access is much slower, maybe 100 times slower.

This is of course related to LevelDB only marking deleted
items as deleted, and dont take them away immediately.

But ...

... how can that be so slow? Whats happening?
... is this fixed after a compaction?
... can I force a compaction?

BTW - we are using Basho eleveldb as front end to LevelDB.
