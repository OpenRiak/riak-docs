Hey list,

I'm going to be doing our first full-cluster upgrade in production soon.
The docs suggest this is as easy as stopping a node, upgrading, and
restarting the node - doing each node one at a time. Before I start, It'd
be great if someone could confirm that I have this right.. :)

Thanks
Matt
