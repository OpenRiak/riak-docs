I spent the Christmas break setting up a Riak cluster and documenting all
the steps. I've got a howto/tutorial set up at
http://jeff.jke.net/2011/10/02/setting-nosql-cluster that will walk you
through the steps.

In particular, I aimed for low cost and low power. Each node in the cluster
boots off the network (single point of maintenance for all node OS
configuration) and just requires a data drive. Nodes are assigned addresses
using DHCP and automatically update vm.args and execute reip if the node
address changes from boot to boot. The scripts for this might be handy for
anyone else running in an environment where machine addresses change
(Amazon, etc).

I'd love feedback, and more to the point, I'd like to find someone to walk
through it step-by-step and make sure I didn't miss anything.

Oh, and \*thanks\* to the list for helping me with configuration help over
the last couple weeks!
