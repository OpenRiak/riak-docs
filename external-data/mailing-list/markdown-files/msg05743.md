Hi,

 I was able to set up a riak cluster with 4 nodes. I am using ripple as an
orm for riak db, but I can only configure with one node. I am getting data
replicated in other nodes but, the issue is if the configured node with
ripple is down I was not able to make use of the other nodes. Is there a
way that I can configure ripple with all those nodes? Or can is there
something wrong with the cluster setup ? I followed wiki.basho.com for the
cluster setup.

Regards,
Vamsi.
