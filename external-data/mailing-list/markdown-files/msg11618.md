Hi everbody,

I'm using riak to store large numbers of FX rates, to allow for deep
backtests of trading strategies. My code seems to be working, except
that I don't get any keys back from 2i range requests.

Here's the code which puts the rate into riak (the rate is itself a
protocol buffers object):

 std::string s = p->rate().time();
 std::string rate;
 p->rate().SerializeToString(&rate);

 mrx::riak::RpbPutReqPtr req(new mrx::riak::RpbPutReq());

 req->set\_bucket(symbol);
 req->set\_key(s);

 mrx::riak::RpbContent\* content = req->mutable\_content();

 content->set\_value(rate);

 mrx::riak::RpbPair\* index = content->add\_indexes();

 index->set\_key(vm["riak.index"].as());
 index->set\_value(s);

Here's the code which does the index search:

 mrx::riak::RpbIndexReqPtr req(new mrx::riak::RpbIndexReq());

 req->set\_bucket(symbol);
 req->set\_index(vm["riak.index"].as());
 req->set\_qtype(mrx::riak::RpbIndexReq::range);

 req->set\_range\_min(vm["rates.start"].as());
 req->set\_range\_max(vm["rates.end"].as());

I originally used the string "time" as the index key, and there was no
error when doing the put command. However, when trying to search with
this index, I got the following error:

 [{unknown\_field\_type,<<"time">>}]

This error went away when I used "time\_bin" as the index. However,
regardless of what I use as the index key when doing the put, I never
get any keys returned during the search.

Can someone point me to a working example of using protocol buffers to
do a put and subsequent index search? The examples online only show the
latter.

thanks,

Joey
