Per the advice from my earlier question (about retrieving records in a 
particular sort order), I've been playing with Riak Search in an attempt to use 
a range query over a numeric field to get the sort order that I want (or at 
least the right range).

For the life of me, I can't get Riak Search to index on a numeric value, even 
if it is a \*\_num field. I know that Lucene had some issues in the past with 
having to get around the standard parsers stripping out numbers, but I had 
assume that since Riak Search explicitly has a numeric type in its schema, that 
this would be supported out of the box.

Anyhow, I've tried every combination of setting up fields name as \*\_num, with 
values as strings or as unquoted ints, with using different encoding, etc. The 
net of it is that I can't query on anything numeric.

What's the trick?

Thanks,
-- GWF
