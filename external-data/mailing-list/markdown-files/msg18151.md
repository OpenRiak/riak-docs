Hi Alex, the code bellow is used to set up the Riak Client (if no one is
already started) or share the client with the threads.

 public RiakClient getDB() throws UnknownHostException {
 if (client == null) {
 client = RiakClient.newClient("localhost");
 }
 return client;
 }

According to the Java library's documentation on GitHub, the object
returned as a client could be used by multiple threads...
The class where I'm doing this is a singleton class, in a facade model.

Att.,
