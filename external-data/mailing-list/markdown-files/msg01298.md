Hi Mark,

AFAIK, "buckets" are a virtual concept serving the purpose of namespace 
separation and as a way to isolate changes in default behavior such as 
replication values, commit hooks, backends and the like. Currently with the 
bitcask default backend, buckets are "free" in that they do not take up 
resources on their own if, for instance, you were to have thousands of buckets. 
The only concern when dealing with buckets is when changing the default 
behavior as those specific changes are relayed around the cluster over the 
gossip protocol. The more buckets you have that deviate from the default the 
more information that has to be chattered around the cluster.

That said, I believe deleting all the keys in a bucket will effectively 
"delete" the bucket. Although, it was never really there to begin with.
