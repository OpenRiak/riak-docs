Riak Recap for January 6 - 10
======================

1) Q - How can I check which version of Riak I'm running?

 A - 
http://serverfault.com/questions/348530/how-can-i-check-which-version-of-riak-i-am-running


2) Steve Vinoski wrote a piece for the Jan/Feb issue of Internet
Computing about Wriaki and Webmachine.

\* Details here --->

3) This was on the Mailing List already this month but I wanted to put
it in the Recap as it's an incredibly valuable resource -> Jeffrey
Eliason wrote a \*very\* extensive piece all about setting up and
running a Riak cluster. Take the time to read this if possible and
shoot Jeff some feedback on it if you have the chance as I know he was
looking for it. Thanks, Jeff!

\* Guide here ---> http://jeff.jke.net/2011/10/02/setting-nosql-cluster

4) Voxer was written up in TechCrunch yesterday, and Riak got a nice mention.

5) I made it known on Twitter yesterday that I would send a Riak
t-shirt to anyone who got Riak Control, the new Riak Admin UI
(officially supported in the 1.1 release and built primarily by Jeff
Massung and Johh Newman), up-and-running and sent me a screen shot.
Here's what it looks like for anyone interested:
