Listing keys in a bucket has been described as "bad" and something you use in 
development but
not in production. I'm just starting out on Riak so I'm a newbie...

I'm thinking of building an application using Riak as filestorage and possibly 
much more than that, but it would
at least store lots of files with, perhaps, metadata attached. How would I then 
list files for display in a webapp if
I don't use key listing?

I've been thinking of perhaps maintaining a separate index for all the files 
but this would get VERY large when
there are many files in riak, so updating this index (I assume) would involve 
getting the index inserting something
and then putting it back into riak.

For example in a Railsapp I would then get the whole index (as json) and 
modifying it, then put it back in riak
but what if there are tens of thousands of files? Should I use a separate 
database for storing the index perhaps - like
MySQL or Mongo? Anyone already doing something like this?
