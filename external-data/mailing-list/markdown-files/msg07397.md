Approximately how fast is "eventually"? Is it based on the network
bandwidth/latency between the clusters or is there additional latency?
Basically, would I expect more or less than a second if the two clusters
were 250 ms away?

Also, how does EDS work with regards to writes to the same key in both
clusters? Does it use a second level of vector clocks or is the vector
clock shared? I imagine last-one-wins wouldn't work in such a setup. Is it
standard practice to send all the writes to a single cluster?

Does the approximately 1 ms of latency between av zones affect Riak's
performance that much?

We were planning to run across av zones for fault tolerance, just beefing
up single nodes for the moment until rack awareness is available. So the
recommended solution is to use EDS to accomplish this?

We currently using "role based" host names. On boot, the Riak machine sets
a CNAME to its public DNS name.

riak1.us-east-1a.example.net -> ec2-203-0-113-239.compute-1.amazonaws.com
riak1.us-east-1b.example.net -> ec2-198-51-100-13.compute-1.amazonaws.com
riak1.us-east-1c.example.net -> ec2-192-0-2-144.compute-1.amazonaws.com

and the cluster members would be r...@riak1.us-east-1a.example.net,
r...@riak1.us-east-1a.example.net, and r...@riak1.us-east-1c.example.net.

The names resolve to either the private or public IP of the machine
depending on whether the machine is in the same region or not. We haven't
tried running across regions yet... so I gather this might confuse
Riak/Erlang?

It helps tremendously!
