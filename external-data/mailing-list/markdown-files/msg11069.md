Suppose I have an object X.

I make an update to X and store it as X1. I perform a put operation using
X1.

The same client then makes a modification to X1 and stores it as X2. Then,
I perform a put operation using X2.

This will create two siblings X1 and X2 if allow\_mult is true. Is there any
way I can avoid this? To me, the vector clock should have incremented once
when transitioning from X to X1, then once more when transitioning from X1
to X2. This way, I shouldn't need to issue a get before I have to perform
another write since my data is already in memory.

I probably am misunderstanding something about vector clocks. Does anybody
care to clarify this?

Thanks,
Jeremy
