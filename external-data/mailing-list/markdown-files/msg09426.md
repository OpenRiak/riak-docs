Hi folks,

I have a query regarding riak indexes. My current understanding is that
riak cannot index numbers whose representation needs more than 32 bits.
There is an issue on the basho repo to address this -
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/issues/112 . Do you have any idea
when it will be fixed ?

I've mentioned a way to work around this problem on a comment on the issue.
The work-around would not be efficient since JS code would have to go
through N rows to drop ones that do not fit a particular criteria on the
number. If there is a better solution to the problem, I'd like to hear your
thoughts on that also.

Thank you for your time.
-Deepak
