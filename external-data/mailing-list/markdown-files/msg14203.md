I am a developer for a on-premises service that is hosted in our customers’ 
data-center.

My service is using Riak and Riak-CS now (Bitcask+levelDB).

My clients are now requesting to use their backup agents to backup data.

My question is what are the critical files that should be put to the backup 
list so that the data can be restored when disk corruption happens. May I know 
if there’s anymore files should be put into the list besides “anti\_entropy”, 
“bitcask”, “leveldb” and “ring”?

Thanks a lot.
