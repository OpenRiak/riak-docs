I am running 'riak-admin diag disk' and am getting the warning:

16:22:29.851 [notice] Data directory /var/lib/riak/leveldb is not 
mounted with 'noatime'. Please remount its disk with the 'noatime' flag 
to improve performance.


Since I only have one partition I cannot very well 'remount' the disk. 
What is at the root of this warning? What can I do to satisfy this 
warning?
