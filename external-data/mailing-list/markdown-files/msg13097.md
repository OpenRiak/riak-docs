So finally got a chance to try this and I am running into issues (I am on
Riak 2.0pre7) btw.

I have yz turned on:

http://192.168.1.10:8098/yz

I created the index with:

$ curl -i http://192.168.1.10:8098/yz/index/allLogs
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.10.5 (jokes are better explained)
Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2013 22:51:15 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 41

{"name":"allLogs","schema":"\_yz\_default"}


And associated the search to the bucket probs:

http://192.168.1.10:8098/buckets/logs/props

{

props:
{

allow\_mult: true,
basic\_quorum: false,
big\_vclock: 50,
chash\_keyfun:
{

mod: "riak\_core\_util",
fun: "chash\_std\_keyfun"

},
dw: "quorum",
last\_write\_wins: false,
linkfun:
{

mod: "riak\_kv\_wm\_link\_walker",
fun: "mapreduce\_linkfun"

},
n\_val: 3,
name: "logs",
notfound\_ok: true,
old\_vclock: 86400,
postcommit: [ ],
pr: 0,
precommit: [ ],
pw: 0,
r: "quorum",
rw: "quorum",
small\_vclock: 50,
w: "quorum",
young\_vclock: 20,
yz\_index: "allLogs"

}

}

I put in a text/plain entry with:

http://192.168.1.10:8098/riak/logs/26-11-2013T2260?vtag=47ffPuWSln7VhlTl02raJA

[2013-11-26T22:43:26] [ERROR] [192.168.1.102] [0] [thakore.kar...@gmail.com]
test

http://192.168.1.10:8098/riak/logs/26-11-2013T2260?vtag=6IYwwPE27eUbs8ThaSOcTC

[2013-11-26T22:39:59] [ERROR] [192.168.1.102] [0] [thakore.kar...@gmail.com]
test



But when I search:

http://192.168.1.10:8098/search/allLogs?q=\*

No results

http://192.168.1.10:8098/search/allLogs?q=test

No results


Whats going on?

eventually remove the old resource but we never did. You can still use the
old style but I would recommend using the new style as it is what we use in
official docs and there is a chance perhaps the old resources don't stay up
to date with the latest features.
