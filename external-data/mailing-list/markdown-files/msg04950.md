Having separate nodes for reads and writes provides an opportunity for
better isolation and control even when the requests are forwarded to
different vnodes...

Just like with anything else you can always build something on top...
The difference in maturity is determined by what you have to build
yourself vs what's already available and integrated into a unified
solution. Yes, there are different and unique aspects to how NoSQL
databases operate, but it's no excuse for not having any integrated
security. It's going to take time for integrated solutions to emerge,
but this is exactly what I was saying about the maturity stage the
NoSQL databases are in.

There won't be a perfect security solution right away. And it's not
just one thing... there are many aspects to security and it'll take
time to develop and go through various stages of evolution. And by
definition, it will make things slower :-) I did not give Accumulo as
an example of a NoSQL database that figured out this whole "security"
thing. Either way saying, "you customer go take care of our database
product security" is not the answer :-)
