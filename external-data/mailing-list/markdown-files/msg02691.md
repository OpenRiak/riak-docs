I implemented a pre-commit hook for riak which gets and updates a specific
"meta" key whenever commits satisfy a specific criteria. I have noticed
however, that doing Client:get to retrieve the "meta" key takes long, and
seriously slows down my commits (about 20 times slower). Are there any
advices on how to do this correctly? I currently call riak:local\_client in
the commit hook and then do riak\_client:get.
