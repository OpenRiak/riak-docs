Hi there,

I was trying to download Riak S2 to do some testings on it, but seems the
download page takes you to Riak CS2.1.1:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/cs/2.1.1/downloads/

Are they the same?

Also, in https://packagecloud.io/basho there is no indications of Riak-s2
but Riak-cs.

Is very confusing.

Thanks,
Alex
