First, hello all!

Coming from Redis, I love that you can just put any binary blob in Redis
which is just treated as a string. This is possible because Redis strings
are what they call 'binary safe'. This makes it possible to return slices of
string-encoded binary data, which is super useful for bitset-operations,
etc.

I'm investigating Riak and I like it a lot so far. Riak seems to have range
queries (on values, as it seems I must make that distinction with
column-stores), but I'm not sure if strings in Riak are "Binary safe" in the
above sense. If not, is there another way to store binary data in Riak and
still do range queries over them quickly?

To be exact: I want to do multi-key lookups in Riak, where each returned
result should be of format: 

Thanks, 
Geert-Jan
