Hi,

For the project that I am currently working on, we are trying to decide on
the best way to store relational data in riak. At first glance, the obvious
choice looks to be links, however one of our requirements is that this
relationship information has to be sent to a client along with actual data.
 The client has to be able to map the relationships between the
data solely from the information it receives while being completely outside
of Riak.

So, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions? We are considering
either encapsulating our relationship data within the riak store itself (in
the value tied to the key), or using riak links. However, if we use riak
links, then we have to convert those links into data that the client can
receive & understand when sending data, and then convert the data we get
back from the client into riak links; we are wondering if this extra step
is worth implementing this kind of a translation.
