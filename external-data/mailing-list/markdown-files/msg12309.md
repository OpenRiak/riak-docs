Hi Markus,With Riak 1.4, 2i results are sorted in ascending order. So a range query from 0 to 99999999 or 99999999 to 0 with a max result of 1 will always return the lowest index value. In your case you may want to store the largest key # somewhere, or if you need to find it infrequently you may also try a map reduce job.  How often will you need to know this max key?Thanks,Alex MooreOn September 18, 2013 at 5:56:22 AM, Markus Doppelbauer (doppelba...@gmx.net) wrote:Hello,Is there a chance to get the biggest key of a bucket or secondary index?E.g.: A bucket (or 2i) contains the keys: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50The result should be: 50 Could this problem be solved, by quering a secondary index from back, e.g.:curl http://localhost:8098/buckets/mybucket/index/field\_int/99999999999/0?max\_results=1 Thanks a lotMarkus
