Has anyone had experience running multiple clusters on the same host(s)?

We have two distinct data sets that we'd like to keep in riak, but one of
them is more experimental, so we'd like to run them as separate clusters.
 That being said, it would be preferable to use the same hardware if we can.

I see that it's described here in the docs:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/basic-cluster-setup/#Multiple-Clusters-on-One-Host

But was curious if there were any gotchas with running that in a production
environment.

Thanks,
Patrick
