Hey Everyone,

I am very excited about the new `one` and `many` relationships, and put 
together a first pass of an implementation of accepts\_nested\_attributes\_for[1] 
(see the rdoc[2]).

 [1]:http://github.com/bkaney/ripple/commits/anaf
 
[2]:http://github.com/bkaney/ripple/blob/anaf/ripple/lib/ripple/nested\_attributes.rb

I want to use `fields\_for` and the rails machinery for ANAF, as I feel is it a 
very critical and reusable tool for app development. 

I haven't implemented :reject\_if or :allow\_delete options, but plan to in the 
near future. I was hoping to get some eyes and critiques on this very early 
first pass.
