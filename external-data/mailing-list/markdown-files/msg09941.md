Simon,

Correct, that behavior is unchanged. Note that the hash stored in the
AAE trees is a hash of the \*entire\* object, including metadata, vector
clock and any siblings. If two replicas diverge because of concurrent
writes, the AAE-triggered read-repair will cause the siblings to be
stored on both replicas. However, once the read-repair is successful,
they will have the same hash and not repair again.
