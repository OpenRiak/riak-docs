Hi Riak users,

I'm wondering what the best approach to this is. The scenario is that
I have mounted a new drive to the machine and want to have the node
leverage that drive to save data as opposed to the mount point it is
currently writing to.

My current plan is to start a second instance of riak (by changing the
name in the vm.args file) and having it join the cluster, followed by
removing the previous node. Then to repeat this for all nodes for
which the upgrade applies while monitoring the dashboard to see if the
handoffs are occurring appropriately.

Is there an easier way or better way, and are they any potential
issues with this approach?

Thanks,
Jeremy
