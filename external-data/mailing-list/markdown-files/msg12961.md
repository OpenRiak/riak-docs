I've just starting with search and I'd appreciate clarification on the
following:

1. I understand that search automatically analyzes JSON, but that does
include nested JSON objects?

2. If I want to return more than just key/value pairs what options do I
have aside from using search queries as input for MapReduce jobs?

3. When it comes to "children" objects, is it better to search for objects
or rely on numerous links?

Thanks.
