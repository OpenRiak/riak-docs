The data partitioning is done on they key level not the bucket level. An n\_val 
of three will result in 3 vnodes/partitions holding replicas of the data. One 
of your nodes would control two of the three partitions.

This is due to the fact that 2 of the 3 vnodes were able to respond with your 
data, but not the third because your took down the node that had 1 of the 3 
partitions.

N replicas means N instances of the key will exist throughout the cluster.
