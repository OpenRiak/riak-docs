Release Candidate 6 for 2.9.0 is now available on github. It is available
to build from source here - https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0rc6.

Apologies for the churn of release candidates on 2.9.0. As part of
the move to 2.9 there has been a big update to the mochiweb/webmachine
code, getting that more in line with current upstream - and this has
thrown up some issues.

All usual caveats arise. This is a release intended for testing in
non-production environments.

Apologies for the ongoing delays getting this release through the test
process. I'm hopeful this will be the last candidate before we release 2.9.0.

Regards

Martin
