I am happy to announce Welle [1], a Clojure client for Riak with batteries 
included.

Welle has almost all the features one would expect from a Riak client:

 \* K/V operations
 \* Bucket operations
 \* Secondary indexes
 \* Map/reduce queries
 \* Links, link walking
 \* HTTP and Protocol Buffers transports

and also provides some additional or Clojure-specific things:

 \* Transparent serialization and deserialization of stored values for common 
formats (JSON, Clojure reader, text, gzipped JSON)
 \* core.cache protocol implementation on top of Riak
 \* Ring session store implementation on top of Riak
 \* Unit testing helpers

Finally, my favorite feature is documentation guides at http://clojureriak.info.

Welle is licensed under the EPL and targets Clojure 1.3+ from the ground up.

Documentation guides are pretty complete and API is stable. To get started, 
please
visit http://clojureriak.info/articles/getting\_started.html. New releases and 
important updates are
announced on Twitter @ClojureWerkz.

We also have a mailing list [3] and use travis-ci.org for continuous 
integration [4] against 3 Clojure versions
(1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 master snapshots).
