Hey Severin,

I just went through the steps to install Riak on a m1.small using AMI
ami-3fec7956. After that I enabled PAM based limits and set them to
65536 as outlined in the "Enable PAM Based Limits for Debian & Ubuntu"
section here [1]. I \*DID NOT\* uncomment `UseLogin` in the sshd
configuration file. Below are the commands to verify that the open
files limit was increased:

 ubuntu@ip-10-108-23-155:~$ sudo su riak
 riak@ip-10-108-23-155:/home/ubuntu$ ulimit -a | grep "open files"
 open files (-n) 65536
 riak@ip-10-108-23-155:/home/ubuntu$

Are you using a different AMI? Can you try giving it another shot
using only the section on enabling PAM based limits?
