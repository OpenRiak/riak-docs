Greetings Riak Users!

With Riak v2.0 in pre-release there have been some interest in a
client that can exercise the new features (specifically, CRDTs).

We're not quite done with the user level API, but the core of the new
Java client is to a point to where it can be used to do so.

The master branch in the github repo will now build the core preview
of the new client.

https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/tree/master

The README has more info and an example of how to get it up and running.

I've also generated and posted the Javadocs online
http://basho.github.io/riak-java-client/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/

Thanks!
- Roach
