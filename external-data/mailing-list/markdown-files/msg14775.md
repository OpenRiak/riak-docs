We have some prototypes for how to expand Pipe's capabilities thanks
to Chris Meiklejohn. We have not exposed it directly and I honestly
think it may be the fundamentally wrong level of abstraction to
present to users. It could be a way to implement higher-level
query/processing features, but that has not panned out and is low on
our priorities at this time.
