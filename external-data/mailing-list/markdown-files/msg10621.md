Rob,

Riak Search doesn't have a traditional term-frequency count. It has
something similar but it's an estimate and it is much more expensive than a
simple table lookup. Even if it did have term-frequency it doesn't really
expose it to the outside world. Not only that, but the standard analyzer
provides no way to specify additional stop words. You'd have to keep track
of this data externally and do some pre-processing to remove stopwords
before.

For the last 9 months I've been working on a project called Yokozuna with
the goal to replace Riak Search [1]. It's like Riak Search except much
better because the underlying engine is actually Solr/Lucene, not an
inferior clone written in Erlang. In that case you could add new
stopwords, exploit query caching, and use newer features like LUCENE-4628
[2] to help combat high frequency terms. You'd also have an easy way to
get frequency count for a given term to determine if you should make it a
stopword.
