After running a backup last night my server was almost completely hosed.
 After investigating it seemed like beam.smp's memory usage had grown to
1.6G which is nearly all available memory on that box. After forcefully
shutting down riak and restarting it, everything went back to normal. Now
after monitoring beam.smp for a while it seems to be slowing increasing its
memory footprint with normal usage. Is this normal?
