Hi,

I am developing an OTP (One time password) API for my company, and using
Riak with riak-python-client to store used passwords. Everytime users try
to login, a function will delete all used passwords that are older than 5
minutes:

def delete\_old\_otps(username, pid, EPOCHTIME):
 client, bucket = open\_otp\_db(pid, username)
 for key in bucket.get\_keys():
 cached\_otp = bucket.get(key)
 if not cached\_otp.exists():
 continue
 otp\_time = int(cached\_otp.get\_data().get('EPOCHTIME'))
 if (EPOCHTIME - otp\_time) > 30:
 cached\_otp.delete()

If there are 2 (or more) threads use this function at a same time, it will
cause error. Assume that both thread A and thread B have retrieved the keys
list (use bucket.get\_keys()), and thread A deleted all of the old passwords
in the bucket, then when thread B tried to execute:

 cached\_otp = bucket.get(key)

cached\_otp.get\_data() would return None, causing error in this line:

 otp\_time = int(cached\_otp.get\_data().get('EPOCHTIME'))

Anyone can help me with this problem?

Thanks for any hint/comment,
Lưu Tuấn Hải

P/S: Sorry for my bad English
