Hey riak-users,

We've just officially released the official Riak Python Client,
version 1.5.0, to pypi.python.org. The primary updates in this release
are related to Riak 1.2 compatibility, so if you're using Riak 1.2,
this is an important upgrade. Our apologies for the delay on this
release.

As always, please report bugs, issues, and enhancements on Github:
https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/issues

Cheers,
