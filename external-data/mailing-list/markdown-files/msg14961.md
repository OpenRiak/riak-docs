I'm going to be testing out Riak for use in an open source game server
platform I created, and was looking for some tips on use and configuration.

Read/write volumes as are normal for many games, is about 50/50.
Consistent response times with low latency is a priority, as is not having
eventually consistent get out of control like with what can happen with
that 'other' nosql db (ya another horror story not worth going into here).

The data being saved would be a combination of json and binary. It's
protocol buffers and I provide the option to serialize to json or native
protobuf.

Currently all keys are compound. A scope followed by a delimiter followed
by the actual key.

Usage patterns basically break down into two groups. One is data that can
change up to several times a second. Local caching is available, but
updates to the database every few seconds would be required.

The other class of data does not change that often, and in some cases
requires atomic updates. This would be in game trading, etc..


Any tips people have on getting the most out of Riak for this type of
environment would be appreciated.
