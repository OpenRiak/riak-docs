Hello everyone!


Would like to ask.

Found on http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/install-custom-code/ 


that i should find and add data in app.config

ok, where i can find it???? 

i have this conf file in my rebar, but donâ€™t know if it is right, maybe it 
should be created for riak somewhere???


thank you!
