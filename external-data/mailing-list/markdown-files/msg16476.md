Hi Kota, thanks! I tried that and I didn't get anything - in fact using riak-cs 
attach with any command I don't get feedback at all, even if I put in garbage. 
Is there something amiss with my setup? 

Everything else seems to be working fine, the user I created per the setup 
instructions can access and create buckets, etc.
