Is anyone using this as a frontend for Riak?

I'm looking at using it, but the packaging is kind of wonky, thought
it's kind of based around Rebar (I'm trying to use it as a dep) so it
doesn't build clean in that situation.

Zotonic didn't work real well, even following tutorials and whatnot.
I haven't tried Chicago Boss yet, though that looks good.

I need to build out a ticket/reporting tool, and while I could do it
with erlydtl, using Misultin that I have already, I figured I'd try to
leverage existing code and hopefully save myself some work.
Of course, it's not rocket science so even a few days wasted with
frameworks is most of the project right there.

Anyone have any experience with these, backed by Riak?
Is it worth working around Nitrogen's wonky layout/building, or should
I move toward something else?

Thanks!
