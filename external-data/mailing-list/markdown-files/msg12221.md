Hi there,

I managed to install a 5 Node RIAK CS Cluster and it seems to work fine.

Anyway, there are some things I still do not understand:

I managed to add, revoke, remove users through riak-cs-controll, but I
don't really like to use this tool, as for me it feels like another
possible security hole (I want to use riak cs on public servers for public
available files).

I likely understood s3cmd, for getting informations about Buckets, Objects
and Users.

I also got amazon-s3-php-class to work, to upload files and create buckets.

But I'm not really familiar with the concept of s3curl, the proxying and
the URL (s3.amazonaws.com). Can I simply put my own URL in front of my
cluster (round-robin at best) and push to that cluster through a http Proxy
(like varnish, sitting on each node to cache hight frequently fetched
files) and which console tool I have to use, with which parameters? Same
for the users. Which console tool do I have to use with which params to
add, revoke, remove users?
