Hi everybody,

I assume this question was already discussed but i didn't find the answer.

In a production environment, we plan to use Riak with Innostore and 
after Bitcask has been approved for a production environment, we will 
switch to it. So, we wonder if we can, only in the migration time, 
switch off a node, change its backend,

and switch it on. This could work ?

I think the other way to do that is to backup the node, change the 
backend, and restore the node. Do you agree with that ?


Thank you.
