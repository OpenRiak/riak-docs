Greetings,

I am not able to answer your tombstone questions. That question needs a better 
expert.

Just wanted to point out that Riak now has global expiry in both the leveldb 
and bitcask backends. That might be a quicker solution for your frequent 
delete operations:

Technical details for the leveldb expiry are found here:
