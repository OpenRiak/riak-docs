Hello Riak Users!

I'm seemed to have stumbled upon a similar issue as to one which was
"fixed" in Riak TS 1.5.2:

 \* [PR 1581 ] A WHERE
 clause filtered on the quantum column, that used the = operator,
 would sometimes return a |Neither upper or lower time bounds were
 specified in the query| error.

The query:

SELECT \* FROM Alerts WHERE time >= 1463522400000 AND time <
1495058400000 AND (drug\_id = 13308 OR drug\_id = 13111) AND field\_limit
= 'Bolus Time' AND (action = 'Pull Back' OR action = 'Double Confirmation');

My query seems perfectly well formed, afaik, but I also get the error
(in riak-shell):

\*Error (1001): Neither upper or lower time bounds were specified in the
query.\*

Any thoughts? Thank you!

- James
