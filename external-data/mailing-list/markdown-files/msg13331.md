Hi!

I've been trying to find what may be the cause of this.

Every once in a week, all the nodes in my riak cluster start to do some
kind of operation that lasts at least for two days.

You can watch a sample of my munin logs regarding the last week in here:

Take a look at the days 19 and 20, and now it has started again on the 26...

I'm suspecting that this may be caused by the aae hash trees being
regenerated, as you say in your documentation:
For added protection, Riak periodically (default: once a week) clears and
regenerates all hash trees from the on-disk K/V data.
Can you confirm me that this may be the root of the "problem" and if it's
normal for the action to last for two days?

I'm using riak 1.4.2 on 6 machines, with centOS. The backend is levelDB.

Best Regards,
Edgar Veiga
