Hi all,

I've recently noticed a few emails for this list slipped through my filters. 
Investigating, I noticed the List-Id changed in the messages. Originally, 
they were:
List-Id: discussion of the Riak data storage system
 

But some messages now have:
List-Id: discussion of the Riak data storage system
 

I don't know why it just randomly changed. Messages continue to be sent in 
both formats. I updated my filters to handle this issue, but I thought I 
should point it out as well.

Thanks,
-- 
Matthew
