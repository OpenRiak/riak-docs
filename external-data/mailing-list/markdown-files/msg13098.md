Hi Reid,

Thank you for your reply. The cluster is fine. It's a 38 nodes members 
and it's very robust :).


We have this error with the Boto's API on set acl command : set\_acl 
operation : file\_key.set\_acl('public-read') . Sometimes this riakcs' 
requests gives a return 403 error but after some automatics retry, the 
requests are successfull. How we correct this problem ?


Regards,

Charles



Hey Charles,

This happens when anonymous requests are made to Riak CS. The error message is 
misleading, at it should simply be an info message. I'll file a ticket to 
change the severity. How's the cluster holding up otherwise?

We have this error in our riak-cg/error.log sometimes on random nodes :

This appear sometimes and after requests are ok.

Someone have an idea ?
