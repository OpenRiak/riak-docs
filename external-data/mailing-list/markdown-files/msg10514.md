I got rid of the "not enough results . . ." messages by adding
{enforce\_keyrange, 1000}. To the configuration. But this leaves two
questions:

 

1) I see messages like:

 

15:27:06.175 [info] Using http target "172.16.33.221":8098 for worker 1

15:27:06.175 [info] Using pb target "172.16.33.221":8087 for worker 1

 

Even though I listed 4 nodes I only see worker type messages for up to 3. I
was expecting to see worker message for worker 4 but it is not there

 

2) At the end I see:

 

15:27:07.195 [info] Application basho\_bench started on node
'basho\_bench@127.0.0.1'

15:28:08.214 [info] No Errors.

15:28:08.219 [info] Application basho\_bench exited with reason: stopped

15:28:08.223 [info] Test completed after 1 mins.

 

Shouldn't I see some kind of results? I only see that it ran with no errors.
Are the results of the run put somewhere else?

This is a major step forward. It actually is doing something. Thank you. Now
the output is littered with messages like 'not enough results . . . ',
instead of results. Ideas?

Actually, I think the config option needs to be:

 

"{mynode, ['  basho\_bench@127.0.0.1']}."

Hey Kevin,

Any chance you can pop into #riak on freenode? We can do this
trouble-shooting in real time. :)
