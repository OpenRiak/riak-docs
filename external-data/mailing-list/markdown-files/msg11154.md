Hey Otto

So a fundamental design attribute of Riak (and other key/value stores) is
that data retrieval is done by knowing the key.
To pull the first 10 keys is similar to what one would do in a relational
DB like MySQL.

However with Riak this sort of operation is expensive as a full table scan
is done. The keys are not indexed.

There some work-arounds/solutions though:

 - Use the Riak Secondary index. Documentation is available.
 - Set a key which has as a value all the keys in a list format.
 ['key1', 'key2', etc...]
 - This requires you to maintain this properly and keep the "eventual
 consistency" in mind.

Just my 2 cents.

Hope it helps.
