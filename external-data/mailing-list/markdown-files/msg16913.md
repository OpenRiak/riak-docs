Paulo,

There is nothing to prevent you from "stacking" multiple protocol buffer 
request packets into the TCP chain. None of our published clients support this 
usage, but it is known to work. You would always get the response packets in 
the order you sent request packets. The benefit is that there is no round trip 
wait between response of first packet and arrival at server for request in 
second packet.

Start with stacking two packets at a time, then work up until throughput no 
longer changes.
