Hey All,

Just a quick email to spread some great community news...

Over the weekend we added Kevin Burns as a committer on the Riak PHP Client.

If you read the Recaps you already know that Kevin, who goes by
"KevBurnsJr", has been hard at work making the PHP client more robust
and recently started writing an Ripple-like layer for the client.

Thanks, Kevin! We are looking forward to your contributions.

Mark
