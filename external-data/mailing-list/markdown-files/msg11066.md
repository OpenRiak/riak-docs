Hi Julien,

The node appear to have crashed due to inability to allocate memory. How are 
you accessing your data? Are you running any key listing or large MapReduce 
jobs that could use up a lot of memory?

In order to ensure that you are efficiently resolving siblings I would 
recommend you monitor the statistics in Riak 
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Statistics-and-Monitoring/). 
Specifically look at node\_get\_fsm\_objsize\_\* and node\_get\_fsm\_siblings\_\* 
statistics in order to identify objects that are very large or have lots of 
siblings.

Best regards,

Christian
