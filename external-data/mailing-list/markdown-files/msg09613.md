Hi,

I am trying to build riak-1.2.1. The make command :~/riak-1.2.1> make gives 
this known error:

==> eleveldb (get-deps)
Cloning into 'leveldb'...
fatal: Unable to find remote helper for 'http'
ERROR: Command ['get-deps'] failed!
make: \*\*\* [deps] Error 1

I saw a resolution on the net saying to do replace git by http:

 get-deps)
 if [ ! -d leveldb ]; then
# git clone git://github.com/basho/leveldb
 git clone http://github.com/basho/leveldb

 (cd leveldb && git checkout $LEVELDB\_VSN)
 fi
 ;;


The problem is that I am behind a firewall.
Is there another solution where I can download some code from basho site into 
some directory in my machine to avoid the firewall issue?

Thanks,
Mohamed
