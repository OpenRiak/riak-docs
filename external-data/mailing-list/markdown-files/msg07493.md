Is there - or could there be - an efficient way to grow/expire indexes
for time-related items like news articles where you would generally
want the results listed newest-first? Like being able to start new
indexes at a rate where the size makes sense, having way to tell the
server to merge the results to cover some timespan, and being able to
expire by just dropping old indexes as they age without having to
rewrite anything.
