Hi all,

I did a quick computation, and figured that I need to be able to manage a 
minimum 5 billion keys roughly 80bytes each. Since Bitcask needs all keys in 
memory, that's a lot of memory. How does it handle swapping? I typically only 
need a portion of those keys available at a given time, so swapping them out 
would be fine if it was intelligent about that and loading it back in. Meaning 
that if it has to pull in the whole index to add a new key, that would be an 
issue for me. I typically need to add new keys pretty quickly and then access 
the most recent ones. The older ones could swap out without too much worry.

Would LevelDB help with this?

Thanks!
