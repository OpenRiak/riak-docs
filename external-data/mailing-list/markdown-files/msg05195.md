With Eric Redmond's permission\*, I am releasing a proof-of-concept 
exploit which uses Riak's mapreduce API to execute arbitrary Erlang code 
and obtain shell access.

Please stop doing this.

\* Eric (http://crudcomic.com/post/11656603627/downside-of-crowdsourcing) 
announced a publicly accessible Riak cluster today; with his 
permission/supervision I used this exploit to gain shell access to his 
server. He's taken down that cluster and encouraged me to release this 
information.


I love the idea of a public sandbox for Riak--but it should be wrapped 
in a rate-limiting HTTP proxy that only allows certain URLs, object 
sizes, and methods. And limits the number of keys. :)
