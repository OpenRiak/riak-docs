Riak Recap for Feb. 2 - 4

1) Bradley Taylor and the team at Webster/Clay released a project of
theirs called "pimp\_my\_riak." This is a "Node template for customizing
Riak" (and easily has the best name yet for any Riak-related piece of
code).

\* Watch, Fork, Clone and Experiment here (but be careful as this may
blow your mind) ---> https://github.com/websterclay/pimp\_my\_riak

2) The latest episode of Minute with Riak was just published. This one
is all about Read Repair and Replicas.

\* Listen here---> http://riak.minutewith.com/pages/20110204

3) There's a new startup out there called "dotcloud" that is
self-described as a "simple application platform for professionals."
Riak is on their list of "pre-configured and heavily tested
components." Might be of some interest to some of you...

\* Details here ---> http://www.dotcloud.com/

4) Riak core was discussed a bit on the Erlang Programming Google Groups list.

\* Thread here --->
http://groups.google.com/group/erlang-programming/browse\_thread/thread/247748233a49e539?pli=1

(h/t to Bradley Taylor for sending this link my way.)

5) We merged some code into the python client based on recent pull
request from Eric Moritz that resolves bug 695.

\* Details here https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/pull/8

Thanks, Eric!

6) wolfeidau and seancribbs had a brief chat in #riak about how one
might store log data in Riak.

7) We have some new code and fixes in Ripple courtesy of Kyle Kingsbury.

Details here ---> https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/compare/e6d3e92...8732730

Thanks, Kyle!
