For releases that's not true. At RC time all rebar.config files change to
fix each dependency on a tag. If we don't control the repo (such as
folsom), I fix the tag on an exact commit. So for each version of Riak
released since about 0.14.2 we can tell you the exact list of commits that
went into each release. If you download the source tarball at each release
you can get the dependency\_manifest.txt file (I added this around 1.0 I
think) it further lists all the tags used for reference.

You can checkout a tag like riak-1.2.0 in basho/riak, do a 'make deps',
then a './rebar list-deps' and you'll see that no repo is a floating commit
or branch.

Thanks,
