Hi,

I am facing a problem in which riak nodes are unable to merge(I inferred it 
from sasl-error log).
I removed all the buckets and started fresh(w/o changing config files)
As soon as I Start riak nodes... one of the nodes gives the following Crash 
Report as soon as it starts:-

=CRASH REPORT==== 19-Sep-2011::08:30:38 ===
 crasher:
 initial call: webmachine\_logger:init/1
 pid: <0.113.0>
 registered\_name: []
 exception exit: 
{{badmatch,{error,enoent}},[{webmachine\_logger,log\_open,2},{webmachine\_logger,init,1},{gen\_server,init\_it,6},{proc\_lib,init\_p\_do\_apply,3}]}
 in function gen\_server:init\_it/6
 in call from proc\_lib:init\_p\_do\_apply/3
 ancestors: [webmachine\_sup,<0.85.0>]
 messages: []
 links: [<0.86.0>]
 dictionary: []
 trap\_exit: false
 status: running
 heap\_size: 377
 stack\_size: 24
 reductions: 545
 neighbours:

But inserts data as usual.
I don't understand if everything is fine then why it is logging a crash report 
on start.
Also that what was the reason of not merging some of the records.

Thanks in Advance

Vicky Khanna
