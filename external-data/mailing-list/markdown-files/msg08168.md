Riak Users,

I know it has been a quiet last week from your friends at Basho, but we've been 
testing 1.2.0 and have a new release candidate for you. Full disclosure, the 
release notes don't indicate a lot of changes since our last RC because much of 
the changes have been to our enterprise product. The OSS changes of note are 
the two bugs-fixed items regarding LevelDB and riak\_control getting a working 
handoff status page.

\* leveldb - Make ref count increase atomic operation under read lock
\* leveldb - Change LRUCache destructor so it does NOT look like a bad reference
\* riak\_control - Patch handoff status to work with status\_v2

Release Notes: https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.2/RELEASE-NOTES.md

Thanks as always for the testing, feedback, and patience!
-Jared
