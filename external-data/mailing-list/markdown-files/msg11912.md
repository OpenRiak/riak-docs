Hi Matt,

You are correct about the Decaying class, it is a wrapper for an
exponentially-decaying error rate. The idea is, you configure your client
to connect to multiple Riak nodes, and if one goes down or is restarted,
the possibility of its selection for new connections can be automatically
reduced by detecting network errors. Of course, this is moot when you are
connecting to the cluster via a load-balancer; at that point the
error-tracking logic can't help you.

If you are creating and throwing away RiakClient objects frequently,
neither the error-tracking nor the connection pool will help you much.
However, I urge you to consider keeping a single client around, in some
globally accessible place (module constant? config object?). Your
concurrent workers will get to take advantage of existing connections, and
your socket/file-handle usage will be less.
