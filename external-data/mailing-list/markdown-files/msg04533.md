This bug was recently fixed -- although the option was available to bitcask
it was not applied when started by the KV backend. (
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/commit/51290526d1e3c0408e6238a55b676809e1b0c840)
However, it may be possible that somewhere inside Bitcask, the osync
strategy is not enacted, but I'll leave that determination to Dizzy.
