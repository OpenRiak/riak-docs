An officially supported first class C and C++ api! I know I've harped on
that one on the mailing list and twitter before - and releasing the alpha
code that was available was a start.. so please know it was appreciated.
However, if C / C++ were, today, a fully supported reliable client library
I'd be testing Riak for serious consideration right now... and I want to be
able to do that. I like riak. :)
