You could try a `riak-cs ping` command and make sure it gets a "pong" response 
as output. Â That's not a solid guarantee that everything's totally started, but 
its better than just sleeping and hoping for the best.

 Hi,I am starting riak-cs for integration tests in a docker container. Does 
anyone know if there is a stat I can use to make sure it is fully started 
before using it? I am currently waiting(sleep) 30s for it to start but ideally 
I could check for a status and continue once it is ready.
