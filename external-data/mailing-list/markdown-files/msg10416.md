Hey Aatish,

The only thing that comes to mind is that 8087 is already in use for
something else (I've done this N times)... but nothing else looks
suspect based on my hasty review.

Some entry level log file info can be found on our docs [1]. I would
start there and see if there's anything fishy.

Also, shameless plug - I was digging around sourcebits.com just now
(beautiful site, btw) and noticed that you're based in San Francisco.
If you happen to be local, you and your team should come to the Riak
Meetup tonight [2]. We can debug in person. :)
