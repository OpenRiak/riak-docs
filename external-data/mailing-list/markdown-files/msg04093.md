Hello,

I had this same problem with a different project (Nitrogen +
Mochiweb). The problem is that in R14B03, there is an additional check
within reltool to prevent duplicate modules from being packaged. IIRC
the best of the kludges was to add an exclude directive in the
reltool.config.

HTH,
Brian
