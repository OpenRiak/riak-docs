Actually, a bucket type is not required. To associate an index with a
bucket you simply set the `search\_index` property. Bucket types provide a
method for many buckets to inherit the same properties. Setting the
search\_index property on the bucket type is a way to index multiple buckets
under one index without setting the property on each bucket. Otherwise, I
would suggest setting the property at the bucket level and not the type
level.

The specific problem Paul ran into is that he tried to change properties
for the default type which is a special type that cannot be altered.
