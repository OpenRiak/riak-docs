I'm still valiantly trying to get all my BSD patches merged, which add
support for Free/Net/Open/DragonFlyBSD to riak. Several have already
been merged and will appear in 1.1, but there's outstanding branches
against eleveldb and the riak repo itself that still aren't merged:

https://github.com/basho/eleveldb/pull/4
https://github.com/basho/riak/pull/90

The eleveldb change is blocked pending google accepting the upstream
change at http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/issues/detail?id=59 so feel
free to make some noise in that bugreport. However, I think it's
unlikely that riak 1.1 will build out of the box on FreeBSD.
