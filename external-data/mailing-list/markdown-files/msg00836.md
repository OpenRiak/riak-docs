It has advantages if the database understands certain datatypes. For,
instance I don't need to round-trip the entire value to and from the
client just to append an item to it if for example, it's a list. This
stuff \*really\* matters when you have performance constraints.

Should, in what context? I'm talking about creating something new
here, on top of riak\_core. My questions are about the feasibility of
whether I could extend riak\_core to be able to handle these
situations. If the client \_should\_ be handling the data with
higher-level semantics (if for example, it's simply not possible to
impose other semantics on the values other than delete / replace in
the current incarnation of riak\_core) then please explain why that's
necessary.

And the multi-values and vector clocks are what I want to preserve in
system that has richer semantics on values (i.e. the values are typed
up to client API level). All I am interested in, is if this is
possible to build on top of a vanilla riak\_core. Perhaps a better
question is this: "Is the fundamental operation of riak\_core coupled
to the fact that values are opaque blobs?". I'm hoping that the
answer is 'no' and this seems like it might be the answer, given that
you said Riak values can be any Erlang term. It's just that that's
not exposed through client APIs, so I am wondering at what level of
the stack that ceases to be the case.
