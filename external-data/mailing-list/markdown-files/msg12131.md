I believe they actually recommend adding all the nodes you want to add in a
single step, instead of one by one - this way the hand-off will happen only
once, and all the objects will go to the right nodes immediately.

If you add nodes one by one, the objects will have to do multiple
transitions, since each added node will cause a redistribution of which
nodes will be responsible for which objects, causing a hand-off process each
time, and you will consume more traffic, time and more resources to get the
same final result.
