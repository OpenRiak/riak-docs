I knew that. I mention the Solr Replication Handler because its one way
to make a backupof
Solr, even when there are no replicas of the index. It can be used to
have Solr create a backup by creating hard links to the index files.

It appears that the recommended way to make a Lucene backup is to make use
of 
SnapshotDeletionPolicyto
take a snapshot, backup all the files the snapshot references, and
then
to release the snapshot.

So it would appear to do it properly, we'd need some support from Yokozuna
to take the snapshot, return a list of files to backup or back them up
itself (hard links?), and then to allow an application to signal it to
release the snapshot or release it itself if its doing the backup.
