Hi Sean,

I am also the person who is using riak client on production with python
2.6.x.

On one of our testing environment we have python 2.6.6, riak-1.4.7 and
python client riak-1.5.1-py2.6.
There frequently I am getting httplib.BadStatusLine causing RiakError:
'could not get a response'
after 3 retries. I found the fix
https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/pull/210.
That fix got merged into master branch, Can I use master branch with riak
-1.4.7
