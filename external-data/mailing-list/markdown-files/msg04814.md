All,

We are pleased to announce the first release candidate for Riak 1.0.0 is now
available.

The packages are available on our downloads page:
http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-1.0.0rc1/

As a release candidate, we consider this to be a functionally complete
representation of Riak 1.0.0. From now until the 1.0.0 release, only
critical bug fixes will be merged into the repository. We would like to
thank everyone who took the time to download, install, and run the
pre-releases. The Riak community has always been one of the great
strengths of Riak, and this release period has been no different with
feedback and bug reports we've been given.

Thanks,
The Basho team
