Oops. You're right - we haven't documented this feature well. The
best I've found is Kevin Smith's reply to another thread on this list:

http://markmail.org/message/bc7ufl2z42yu6dmg

It involves modifying your app.config file to set the js\_source\_dir
variable for the riak\_kv app. For a good example of how to structure
a preloaded-JS file, check out the one that ships with Riak:

http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/src/tip/apps/riak\_kv/priv/mapred\_builtins.js

All of the functions in that file are available to Javascript
map/reduce functions as Riak.. Those functions will
still be available even after you set js\_source\_dir. You might
consider wrapping your application's useful functions in a MyApp class
or some such.

It's also useful to know about "bin/riak-admin js\_reload" if you're
doing this. That command will re-read all of your preloaded
Javascript files.
