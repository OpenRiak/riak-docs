"Where server resources allow, the value of max\_open\_files should exceed
the count of .sst table files within the vnode's database directory."

Is the vnode's database directory the numbered directory under the leveldb
directory? So the process is to count the number of .sst files distributed
acrooss the sst\_# directories. Is that correct?

If It's not correct what are the rules for counting .sst files?

I'm guessing this is something you'd have to tune after deployment as the
number of .sst files would grow with data growth. Any guide lines for
calculating the max\_open\_files before deployment?

- Peace
Dave
