Hi,
I'm trying to make the Java client easier to use and less tied to underlying 
implementation so I've started designing a new API. 

I've put some interfaces up at https://github.com/russelldb/riak-java-client-api

I'd really appreciate any comments you may have.

My intention is to adapt the existing client(s) to these interfaces and 
deprecate the old client API gradually (so there will be backward compatibility 
for a few releases.) I'll also be reusing the existing client implementations 
underneath the API, this isn't a wholesale re-write. 

I hope you can take some time to let me know what you think. I'll put my 
thickest skin on.

Many thanks

Russell

PS It is all maven'd up so just clone and mvn eclipse:eclipse if you want to 
get a good look.
