Thanks, Gordon! 

We are using the Net::Riak perl module, with the PBC transport. 

I have not done any work with this module myself (I'm just running Riak for 
us). 

I'll pass this along.

David what client are you using to access Riak? We are using the Python client 
and the procedure for working with 2i (or anything else) is exactly the same 
whether you are using the http transport (riak.RiakHttpTransport) or the pbc 
transport (riak.RiakPbcTransport).

Hello, 

Apologies if this has been answered! 

I looked around a bit, and see plenty of references to "querying 2i via PBC", 
though nothing that explicitly states that such an index can be created via 
PBC. All the examples I saw employ the HTTP interface. 

Would someone mind supplying an example, if you have done it, please? 

Thanks!
