Hello, I'm trying to do some test with basho bench, using the
basho\_bench\_driver\_riakc\_pb. It seems that a number string key is
unsupported under this driver because all threads crashed when generators
as "{key\_generator, {int\_to\_str, {uniform\_int, 10000}}}" used.But
everything works fine with operations of get or get\_existing.So I wonder if
I can insert a data with such a key without writing a new driver.Please
tell me the way to configure if supported.Thanks in advance.
