More info, in case it helps someone help me figure out what has gone wrong.
I suspect I have something misconfigured, or not configured, that is
affecting the mapreduce js vms.

I followed the instructions on this thread:
http://riak-users.197444.n3.nabble.com/preflist-exhausted-with-map-reduce-and-riak-js-td3821516.html

In that thread, the guys problem turned out to be a missing
mapred\_builtins.js file. I found mine /usr/lib/riak/lib/riak\_kv-1.2.0/priv
so I don't think my problem is the same.

About using the riak console to find out how many map reduce vms are
available:

(riak@127.0.0.1)5> rpc:multicall(supervisor, count\_children,
[riak\_pipe\_builder\_sup]).
{[[{specs,1},{active,0},{supervisors,0},{workers,0}]],[]}
(riak@127.0.0.1)6> rpc:multicall(supervisor, count\_children,
[riak\_pipe\_fitting\_sup]).
{[[{specs,1},{active,0},{supervisors,0},{workers,0}]],[]}
(riak@127.0.0.1)7>
rpc:multicall(riak\_kv\_js\_manager,pool\_size,[riak\_kv\_js\_map]).
{"\b",[]}
(riak@127.0.0.1)9>
rpc:multicall(riak\_kv\_js\_manager,pool\_size,[riak\_kv\_js\_reduce]).
{[6],[]}


May be worth noting that those commands product the same weird output
whether my app.config settings are:
 {map\_js\_vm\_count, 32 },
 {reduce\_js\_vm\_count, 32 },
 {hook\_js\_vm\_count, 16 },

Or the outlandishly high:
 {map\_js\_vm\_count, 4096 },
 {reduce\_js\_vm\_count, 4096 },
 {hook\_js\_vm\_count, 256 },


and look nothing like the Mathew Tobvin's output:
3>rpc:multicall(riak\_kv\_js\_manager,pool\_size,[riak\_kv\_js\_map]).
{[0,0,0],[]}
4>rpc:multicall(riak\_kv\_js\_manager,pool\_size,[riak\_kv\_js\_reduce]).
{[0,0,0],[]}

Also, the output of those commands is the same after running a mapreduce
job. Once in a while, usually after a fresh riak restart and a bit of time
has passed since the last preflist\_exhausted error, one of my mapreduce
jobs will actually complete successfully. At a mere 10000 keys in one
bucket and exactly 1 user, I do not understand at all what is wrong in my
installation. Does anyone have any suggestions?
