Riak Recap for March 14 - 15


1) The date for the Riak Meetup in Stockholm has been changed to March
31. Also, as of right now, there is only one spot left...

2) While we are on the topic of meetups... the Bay Area Riak Meetup is
less that none week away.

\* Details here --->

3) Mark Wolfe put together some thoughtful observations about Riak and
the Java Client. This is a great read.

\* Check them out here --->

4) The DotCloud team let the world know that Riak was part of their
internal stack (along with Redis and PostgreSQL).

\* Read up on it here --->

On a related note, @wmacgyver mentioned he is also using Riak, Redis
and PostgreSQL:

curiosity, anyone else using these three DBs together in their stack?

5) The video of the Riak + Node.js webinar is up on Vimeo. There will
be an official blog post up with this and the slides from the webinar,
but I figured it couldn't hurt to send the link your way a bit early.
:)

6) ncb000gt and seancribbs had a short convo in #riak that started
with "When you store links is the order in which they are returned,
when querying, guaranteed at all (assuming multiple links)?"
