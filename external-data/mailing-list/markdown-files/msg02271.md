Hi All,

I want to set the postcommit hook on a bucket. I can set the bucket properties 
using riak\_client, but this means that I need to be connected to the cluster to 
do this.

I want to be able to dynamically set post-commit hooks on buckets at run-time 
from my client using the Erlang PBC API. Working through the Erlang PBC code, 
the set\_bucket function in riakc\_pb\_socket calls 
riakc\_pb:pbify\_rpbbucketprops/2. This function ignores all properties except 
n\_val and allow\_mult, so it appears that I cannot set the postcommit hook using 
this set\_bucket function.

Is there any other way to do this that I've missed, or do I need to be 
connected to the cluster?

Thanks,
Ryan
