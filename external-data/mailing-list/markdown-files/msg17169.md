Index design question.... 

Suppose I have N customers I am tracking data for. All customer data is 
basically the same structure, and I have determined I need a simple secondary 
index on this data in order to satisfy a business goal. 

Is it better to have N indexes (N ~ 100), or a single index, with the customer 
ID the most significant part of a compound index? 

Assume the app will not access all customers equally, some customers data will 
be accessed far more frequently than others. 

I tend to think a one giant index is more susceptible to failure, and I'm not 
sure how the caching and swapping to disk is affected under each scenario. 

Any thoughts? Target clusters size is 7 nodes., 16GB ram each. If N indexes is 
workable, how high can N be? 

Thanks!
