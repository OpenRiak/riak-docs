Hi Damien,

This one flew by unanswered. After speaking with a friend internally, I
hear that the boundary plugin [1] picks this up and shows it nicely. I
would use that with a basho bench run (How to here [2]) to get a sense of
what the network traffic profile looks like. It is usually quite a bit
higher than just the ingest stream due to replication of 3.

Hope that helps!

Best,
Matt
