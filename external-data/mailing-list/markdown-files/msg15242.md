Hey Zhenguo.

I've actually just gone through something similar myself recently.
​ ​
I found that the most reliable way to do this is as follows:

1. Update the schema (as you have shown)
2. Attach to the Erlang console on each node, and run
rp(yz\_index:reload(<<"index\_name">>)).
​3. List all keys in the buckets with your bucket type, and pull and put
each of the objects in those buckets.

It's not the most ideal way, but it's the most effective (from what I've
found) until the new sear​ch administration functionality becomes available.

Regards,
Geoff
