Hi Mathias,

I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you for committing the
time, effort, and resources to writing the Handbook. This is huge for
both existing users and newcomers to the community, and I have no
doubt that scores of future developers will point to this as at least
part of what helped them grok Riak.

Thank You.
