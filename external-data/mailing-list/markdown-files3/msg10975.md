Tom,

Just to emphasize Joe's comment -- 512 should be the \_maximum\_ you want to
use as your ring size with leveldb/multi backend. But you should probably
use a smaller size, unless your cluster is going to have several dozen
nodes.

The recommended rule of thumb with ring size is "~10 vnodes to a physical
machine". Meaning, if you have a 5 node cluster (and it's going to stay at
5 nodes and not scale that much), using a ring size of 64 is perfectly fine
(since each node is going to have 12 to 13 vnodes on it ( 64 / 5) ).

Say you scale that cluster to 10 nodes, and keep the 64 ring size. Here,
each machine is going to be running 6 to 7 virtual nodes on it (64/10), and
will probably be under-utilized, in terms of hardware resources.
Whereas if you select a ring size of 128 for that 10 node cluster, you're
back to the 12-13 vnodes per machine range.

On the other hand, if you have a 5 node cluster with a ring size of 512,
each machine will be responsible for around 100 vnodes, so unless your
servers are very powerful, they're going to compete with each other for
resources (ram, cpu, etc) and be overwhelmed. Also, keep in mind, that
Secondary Index (2i) queries get slower the bigger your ring size is (since
2i uses "covering" queries -- each request has to contact half of all the
vnodes, so it matters whether it has to contact around 32 vnodes (for ring
size 64) or 256 (for 512)).

So in short, most small to medium sized clusters out there use 128 or 256
ring sizes. If you \_know\_ you're not going to scale past 7-9 nodes, it's
safe to go with 64. If you know you're going to scale to a giant cluster of
50 nodes or some such, use 512 (though at that point, you should
re-evaluate your use of Secondary Indexes).

Last thought - migrating to a different ring size is a big pain, although
it's doable. (You basically have to resort to logical backup tools --
export all your data from the old cluster to disk, and then import it all
to the new cluster).
