Dear basho team:
 I encountered a strange question, we use riak/riak-cs build a cluster, the 
cluster has 7 nodes, DB of riak KV is multi(level & bitcask), earch node has 
16G RAM.total\_leveldb\_mem\_percent=50.
 today we found one node crash down but without crash log, and erlang log has 
something like this:
 terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad\_akkic' wath(): 
std::bad\_alloc
 ??riak kv version??2.0.5??
 [os\_mon] memory supervisor port(memsup):Erlang has closed;
 [os\_mon] cpu supervisor port(cpu\_sup):Erlang has close.
 And we restart this node and it can work properly again, use the (free -m) 
command to view the memory, +-buffered/cache: used=2000Mb available<14000Mb. 
and memory status of other nodes are: used 6000Mb~7000Mb.
can you help me analysis of why the node crash down?
and i found other problem on other cluster. under normal conditions??the memory 
of used was 4000Mb~5000Mb,but 
every 20 minutes will rise once, about doubled, and then returned to normal, 
why?

thank you very much!
