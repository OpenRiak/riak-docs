The content-type is important for Riak KV: Various clients will use it to 
identify the difference between a response where the whole body is the key, or 
a response that contains siblings (if you have allow\_mult=true).

I suggest finding or creating a content type, so that this is clearer to your 
app. It will also allow you to version your objects better. Here are a few 
suggestions (of course replace the text between the < >):
- application/octet-stream - this is usually used for binary data, and is the 
easiest thing to set the content-type to.
- application/vnd.. - a vendor-specific 
type, which you can create yourself
- application/vnd...v - 
another vendor-specific type, which supports versioning.

You don't have to use the information in your final app, but it is used by riak 
and riak clients, so that's why we require it.
