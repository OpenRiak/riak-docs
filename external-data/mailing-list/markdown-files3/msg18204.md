Hi Magnus,

How I can interpret health statics and decide that whether riak cluster is 
healthy or not ? I have gone through all statistics but not able to conclude 
that which and all I have to use to monitor health of cluster and based on what 
I can give conclusion. For eg. Disk status will give percent utilises so I 
monitor it and if it's >85% I can say it's warning, >95% alarm(not healthy) and 
< 85% is normal.

Thanks for kind helps,
Prakash Parmar

Thanks for your quick response.

One more question. How I can get Cluster Status ?

Regards,
Prakash Parmar


Hi Prakash,

The command 'riak-admin cluster status' does not have an equivalent access via 
HTTP. Like most sub-commands of 'riak-admin' it is implemented as an RPC call 
[0] to the riak\_core\_console Erlang module.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
