Hey Finkle,

I attempted to reproduce your issue on my Mac and wasn't able to
trigger the error same error:

$ ./env/bin/pip freeze
protobuf==2.4.1
riak==2.0.1
riak-pb==1.4.1.1
wsgiref==0.1.2
$ ./env/bin/python --version
Python 2.7.5

Do you have any additional details on your Ubuntu environment? What
version of Riak are you running against?
