There looks like there are some strange things happening in the logs with the 
ring as well as timeouts. I would be curious how long the process takes to die 
if you were just to run a stop instead of a restart. Did you at one time 
change the name of this node? 

One thing that might be interesting to try is to stop the server, make a copy 
of your data directory, remove all the data in the data directory, and try to 
start and stop the node and see if it works more reliably.
