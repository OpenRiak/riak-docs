Hi all, I am using C# corrugatedIron client. I would like to get a
verbose log of all of my Riak queries and calls. To help during
development. Whether it's on the client side, or on the server side
(maybe some lager settings in app.config?) doesnt matter. I have been
searching for a way to get this type of log output but seems to be
stumped. Thanks,
Alex
