Hey Basho gang,

Have you all taken any sort of look at FB's leveldb fork, rocksdb, 
http://rocksdb.org/? Just watching Dhruba's video it seems like it may be a 
useful upgrade, 
https://code.facebook.com/videos/174548089418739/rocksdb-a-high-performance-embedded-key-value-store-for-flash-storage-data-scale/.
 The main talking points seems to be that rocksdb upgrades leveldb such that it 
is more efficient when storing data more than system ram, has more efficient 
access patternsto take advantage of ssd's and has a better compaction story.

Care to share your thoughts?

Thanks,

-Alexander Sicular
