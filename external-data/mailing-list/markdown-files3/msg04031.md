Anthony, I shouldn't reply to email in the morning before coffee, but
here's to risking looking silly....

The SASL "PROGRESS REPORT" messages are SASL messages and thus are
written to where the sasl\_error\_logger attributes says to write them.
Messages from a generic error\_logger:error\_msg/info\_msg/warning\_msg and
friends aren't SASL messages and thus aren't necessarily written to
where SASL messages are.
