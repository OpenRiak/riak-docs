Thanks Matthew , we are actually using Bitcask with 128Gb RAM per node.

John,

If you are using leveldb as Riak's backend, keep in mind that each vnode 
requires a fixed amount of memory (set via max\_open\_files and cache\_size in 
app.config). Recently had one user attempt too many vnodes on a 4Gbyte 
machine. He populated data to the point of memory overflow â€¦ then migration 
out of that mess took days.
