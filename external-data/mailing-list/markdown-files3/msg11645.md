Howdy,

I'm working on using ClojureScript (which compiles down to JavaScript) to
define MapReduce jobs in Riak.

ClojureScript compiles down to JavaScript and includes the core
ClojureScript libraries, also compiled down to JavaScript. Even the
simplest functions result in 10K to 100K of library code.

Is there any way to run a JavaScript mapreduce job such that you include an
environment setup set of JavaScript that will be run in the JavaScript VM
before the job starts and then each of the map function calls is a call
into that environment?

Thanks,

David
