John-Paul,

Do you mind posting your config files to go with each run? Some questions
that come to mind:

1. Did you start fresh for each run? (i.e. no data)

2. After adding the 4th node did you add it's IP to the bench config?

3. Do you have any iostat numbers to go with these runs? (both for good and
bad would be useful)

4. Do you see any differences in the Riak logs between the good/bad runs?
 E.g. maybe errors or merge activity?

-Ryan
