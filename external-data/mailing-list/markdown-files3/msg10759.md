I am curious as to how Yokozuna's AAE works. I presume that Yokozuna does
not store a copy of the data it indexed. Thus, while it can create the
entropy tree when data is indexed, my understand it that the tree is
recreated at some interval. I am wondering how Yokozuna recreates the tree
if it does not have access to the original data. I asume its not using the
KV data, since that is exactly what it wants to compare against to ensure
its in sync.
