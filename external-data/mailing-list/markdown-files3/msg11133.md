Matthew's right, and I should have been more clear on a few points:

\* My "tests" were smoke-tests at best. Far too short and far too basic to
really determine anything. That's clear from the results and Matthew's
points are all valid. When bitcask and LevelDB look similar in a test, the
test is wrong.

\* I should have made it clear that I in my weekend of toying with this code
from OpenLDAP I only did enough work to a) make it async, b) build a simple
basho\_bench driver, c) clean up the code a bit but what I didn't do was
build a full Riak integration layer. This was just me testing something
out over the weekend because I was curious, nothing more.

\* I think there is a lot of interesting features in LMDB, but it would take
some time before it could even be considered as a viable backend for
Riak/KV storage and then someone would need to write a backend layer for
it. Our experiences with LevelDB and Matthew's hard work (as he
brilliantly outlined in his RICON/East talk last week) shows just how far
it is from the \*experimental\* testing stage to a production quality stage.

\* I'm not working on building a Riak/KV integration or working on LMDB for
use in Riak and in no way do I (or Basho) endorse it as a viable option for
use in our product. This is just too much work for uncertain payoff at
this point, the experiments I ran were just for fun.

The engineers on OpenLDAP write good, solid code for their very specific
use case which has a few fundamental differences from Riak/KV one being
that LDAP server access patterns are generally 90/10 read/write where as
Riak/KV is at least 50/50 but more commonly heavily weighted toward writes.

So, apologies if I've confused anyone. Brian, I think you should push on
LMDB a bit more and see what you think, maybe it could be awesome at some
point in the future but there is a lot of hard work between here and there!

best,

-greg
