Hi Dan,

Thanks for your reply.

The REST API link was exactly what I was looking for.

By converting the command to HTTP headers, what I meant was seeing all
of the request and response headers. I realize now that the v
parameter does the trick in curl.

The curl requests were all successful. It was the http client request
from within erlang that was the problem. And hence the desire to look
at the http headers more closely (as I perhaps misunderstood how to
formulate them).

Alas, the http client requests still do not work. I use ibrowse. I
try the following in ibrowse for the put request:

4> ibrowse:send\_req("http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true",
[{"Content-Type", "application/json"}], put, [{'{"vvfe":"fegtg"}'}]).


And I get the following error:

{error,{'EXIT',{badarg,[{erlang,list\_to\_binary,
                                [[{'{"vvfe":"fegtg"}'}]]},
                        {ibrowse,ensure\_bin,1},
                        {ibrowse,do\_send\_req,7},
                        {erl\_eval,do\_apply,5},
                        {shell,exprs,7},
                        {shell,eval\_exprs,7},
                        {shell,eval\_loop,3}]}}}

Any suggestions?
