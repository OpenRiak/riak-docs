Ripple indicates that a representative from Basho will come to your home and 
beat you to death if you perform a list keys in production. Is this still a 
massive no-no with 2i?

I'm not familiar with how much is automatically indexed, so I guess I'm asking 
if there is any point in my creating an index that basically all elements of a 
(reasonably constrained) bucket have in common.
