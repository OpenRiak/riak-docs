Not any deeper. But a node can have a couple of thousand children in some 
cases. 
Query pattern is usually fetch all children for a parent.

Thanks,

How much deeper does your tree go? What's the average number of children a node 
has? What is your query pattern (fetch a parent, and all of its children?)?
