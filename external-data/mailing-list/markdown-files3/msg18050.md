There are several mechanisms in Riak that repair data. AAE [0] is intended
to detect corrupted data that is not regularly accessed in other ways. When
objects are read, the read-repair mechanism [1] will also fix up lost or
corrupted data. Finally, if a partition is lost and AAE is not enabled, you
can perform a manual partition repair operation [2].

So, if your use case involves short-lived data, or data that is regularly
read or updated, turning off AAE may allow the cluster to handle a higher
peak load. However, there are several cases where having AAE enabled is
important. These include the use of Riak Search / Yokozuna, which without
AAE will not be able to detect objects missing or not yet deleted from a
Riak core under high load, and AAE based MDC replication. Overall, leaving
AAE turned on is recommended for most use cases, but you should give the
cluster enough resources to handle the maximum expected load while also
doing IO and CPU intensive AAE operations like AAE tree rebuilds.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
