Hi,

I'm benchmarking 2i at scale of billion records, running one physical node
locally with mostly default configs - except for LevelDB instead of
Bitcask. Up to this point (14MM records in the bucket that's being indexed)
it's still performing lookups well for my use case (read ~ 7ms using
riak-ruby-client over http).

However, along this process I've noticed riak to go down twice. First time
(8MM records) I could just start it again and continue my benchmarking from
the point it were left, but now at the second time (14MM records) when I
started riak again, it took about 3 minutes to respond to my first request.

What was happening during these long startup minutes, after my second crash?

Up to which scale have you guys been successfully using secondary indexes?

Any other ideas given my use case / benchmarking scenario?

Thanks,
Wagner
