Since I will be importing data from an existing SQL Server this population 
needs to involve some sort of .NET driver. I would rather not take the time to 
learn python and how it interfaces with SQL Server if possible. Any suggestions?

Subject: Populate and Set\_Siblings

 

Hey all,
I've noticed afew questions on the list serve over the past year. Allot of 
people have asked questions about how/why they should use populate. Mostly its 
because its exposed in the docs without much explanation. Along with 
set\_siblings and some other number of methods in riak\_objects.py, many methods 
which are likely to be only used internally to the class and not marked with a 
preceding \_ which is part of pep 8 here 
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#method-names-and-instance-variables
Sphinx(http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html) should handle this properly and 
hide the methods from users who will not need to look that deeply.
Its a quick sed command for me to fix and fork this, is there a specific reason 
why these are not made "private" and if not what other methods do you all think 
should be included in this off the RiakObject itself?
Michael
