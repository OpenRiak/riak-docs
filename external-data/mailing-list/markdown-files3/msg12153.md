Dmitri,

yes, I have AAE turned on and this discussion seems relevant to my case.
As far as I have understood I have to wait for every tree to expire
after changing expiry\_secs setting (which should be less than a week).
But according to 'riak-admin aee-status' entropy tree built time is
less than 3 days for every partition while setting change had been
made earlier. And only one node actually dropped its memory
consumption by now. Am I missing something?

May be turning AEE off (at least for some time) will help me to reduce
memory consumption since no trees with expired keys at all would be
built?
