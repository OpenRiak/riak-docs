Is this intentional? It seems like odd default behavior. If it is
intentional then perhaps a blurb on the wiki would be nice (I'll do it if
someone asks nicely :) ). I had to dig through the code. I'm using the
master branch, for what it's worth.

For those that want to know, to turn on access logs, add the following to
app.config.

{webmachine, [{webmachine\_logger\_module, webmachine\_logger}]}

If you want all access logs in their own dir then add the following to the
riak\_core list in app.config.

{http\_logdir, "log/access"}
