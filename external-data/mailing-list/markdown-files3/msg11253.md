Andre,

For large files like that, you'll find that Riak CS is a much better fit. Riak 
is not currently designed to handle files above ~ 10MB. Riak CS should support 
the Accept-Ranges header just like S3. If you find a case where that's not 
true, please let us know. It's a bug.

A couple more thoughts inline:

To be clear, a replication value of 3 means there are 3 replicas. Not 3 
\_additional\_ replicas.

I don't know offhand if there are any gotchas with nginx and Accept-Ranges, but 
don't foresee any issues here.

Riak CS is stateless. If a Riak CS box has failed/is-failing/slow, you can 
contact any other one in its place. Stanchion should be run on a singleton 
node, and replaced if it fails. You can also use 'traditional' HA techniques to 
make stanchion handle failover. Note, stanchion is only used for a small 
percentage of requests, like bucket creation/deletion. Normal object CRUD 
requests do \_not\_ require stanchion. So, if it fails, only a small amount of 
requests will be affected until it is back running again.
