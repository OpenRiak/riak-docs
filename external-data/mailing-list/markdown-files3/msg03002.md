Hi,
I have set my schema using riak search. Now i want to test it on multiple node 
on local machine . I have setup three nodes and they are all connected now why 
cannot i access my riaksearch bucket? and how can i do that ? 
Only reason i think is previously i was runing node as "riaksearch start" and 
now nodes are running using "riak start" .


 
Regards,
Muhammad Yousaf
