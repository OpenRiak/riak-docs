Hello

force-deleted a node but I made no modification to bucket properties.

Hi,

I'm not sure but looking at the exception and the code you get function clause 
error because you have the first argument being '$deleted' and the function 
guard expects lists as arguments

https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/blob/master/src/riak\_core\_bucket\_props.erl#L129

The reason for it being '$deleted' I don't know, have you done anything to 
bucket properties or is it just replacing a node?

Regards
Johan Sommerfeld
