Jeremiah is on target, by the way. Also, you have been able to use a property 
as a key for a long time, e.g.:

class Person
 include Ripple::Document
 property :name, String
 key\_on :name
end

There are a number of reasons I have been holding off supporting manual 
secondary indexes, not the least of which is the upcoming support in Riak 
proper.
