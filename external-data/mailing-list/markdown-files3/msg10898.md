I have tested with a bucket with as low as 10 documents as well as another
a couple of hundreds, both in the same cluster, and both returning
stochastic numbers of documents in the result. For the bucket with 10
documents the result varies from around 3/10 docs to 10/10 documents and
the MapReduce is looking like this:

{
 "inputs":{
 "bucket":"som-bucket",
 "index":"userid\_bin",
 "key":"18481123123"
 },
 "query":[
 {
 "map":{
 "language":"javascript",
 "name":"Riak.mapValuesJson",
 "keep":true
 }
 }
 ]
}

I have also tested without using index but using keyfilters instead but
with the same result.

We are using CorrugatedIron as client for all the Riak communication and
one of my colleagues is discussing with developers of the client lib about
the same issue.


Best regards,
Mattias
