Ingo -

Riak is returning an object with no contents (which ends up being an
empty String passed to Jackson).

Unless you've somehow mangled the data yourself (which sounds unlikely
given the bit about the 404 from the command line; more on that in a
bit) what's happening is that you're encountering a tombstone; an
object that has been deleted via a delete operation but hasn't been
removed yet. This causes an "empty" object to be returned (the
tombstone) and causes Jackson to puke (HTTP will actually return this
as a 404 but if you look there's still a X-Riak-Vclock: header with a
vclock).

Probably the best description of how this works in Riak is a post by
Jon Meredith which can be found here:
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2011-October/006048.html

Unfortunately this is something the Java client doesn't know what to
do with when using the default JSONConverter and your own POJOs. And
it's not as simple as "just return null" because of a case where a
tombstone could actually be a sibling and the client then needs to
resolve the conflict which is the next step in the process. It's
something I'm going to have to think about.

As you've discovered, when the tombstone isn't a sibling simply
retrying will often work because by then the delete has fully
completed and the tombstones have been removed from the Riak nodes.

Is there a reason you're rapidly doing a delete then a store (which
triggers that fetch)?

Thanks,
Brian Roach
