Hi All,

Also just tried to restore production data on testing cluster. As you can
see on image - http://s8.postimg.org/eu201p9d1/riak\_rstore.png - it starts
at 480 op/sec and quickly drops to asymptotical 50... We have several
millions of keys, so, it will literally takes ages to restore all data.
Backing up individual bitcask/ring directories and restoring with reip
working like a charm, but require complete stop of testing cluster
operations.

With best regards,
 Denis.
