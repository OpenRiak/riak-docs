Elias,

This is exactly why I chose not to make a core per partition. My gut
feeling was that most users are likely to have more partitions than indexed
buckets. I don't know the overhead per-core or what the limits might be.
 I would recommend the Solr mailing list for questions like that. I've
also looked at that "LotsOfCores" page before. One benefit to using Solr
is that any improvements made to it should also trickle down to Yokozuna.

That said, I still plan to allow a one-to-many mapping from index to
buckets. That would allow many KV buckets to index under the same core. I
have an idea of how to implement it. I'm fairly certain it would work just
fine. I just need to add a GitHub issue and then it's a "simple matter of
coding."
