Jonathan,

We're planning to ship 1.0 at the end of September. A couple of the items
that are planned for this release:

\* Secondary indicies
\* Improved MapReduce system (based on riak\_pipe)
\* riak\_search merged into base product (versus a separate download)
\* Logging system overhaul

There are (a few) other major features cooking on the branches, but they
could float in/out of the release depending on a number of internal and
external factors.

Hope that helps,

D.
