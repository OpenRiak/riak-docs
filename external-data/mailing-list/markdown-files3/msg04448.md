Tony,

We thought this was good question, so I went ahead and added it along with your 
example to our knowledge base. You can find it here 
https://help.basho.com/entries/20390556-what-s-the-difference-between-the-riak-kv-cache-backend-ttl-and-riak-kv-cache-backend-max-ttl.
 We appreciate your help.

Thanks.
