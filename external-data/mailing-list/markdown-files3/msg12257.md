Timo,

Here are some rough concepts of leveldb:

- Compaction in leveldb is triggered by input activity, not by key age or key 
delete. 
- A key delete does not actually delete a key, it creates a "tombstone".
- Old values of a key only get purged if two versions of the key happen to 
participate in the same compaction. Then the oldest is dropped.

Therefore, it is not easy to estimate the length of time before all your 1 to 
3Mb objects purge. They will purge and free up disk space eventually â€¦ but not 
necessarily quickly. There is currently no means for a user to initiate 
targeted compactions to address your situation. You will just have to wait.

Matthew
