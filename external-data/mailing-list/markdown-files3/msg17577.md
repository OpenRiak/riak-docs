Hello! 

Decided to take a look at Riak TS for our monitoring system.
I went through the docs and wonder if it possible to set TTL for metrics? For 
example, in KairosDB with Cassandra, I could set TTL, which would cause metric 
to be marked with a “tombstone” after this time passed and deleted in the next 
clean-up tier.

Does Riak TS have similar feature for auto clean-up old time-series data? 

Thanks.
