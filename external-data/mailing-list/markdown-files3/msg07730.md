After pulling down riak from get, I get the following error when running
make rel:

./rebar compile generate
==> cluster\_info (compile)
==> lager (compile)
==> poolboy (compile)
==> protobuffs (compile)
make: \*\*\* [rel] Error 1


I've had an awful experience getting riak setup. I've wasted two hours
messing around and it still doesn't work. Please improve the experience for
other users.
