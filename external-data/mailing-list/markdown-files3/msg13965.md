Hey James,

Massive respect to any mailing list response about performance that includes 
graphs, thanks!

I plan to keep optimising right up until we release, so hopefully we can 
further improve the performance. From the look of your graphs there is work to 
be done.

Are these graphs for Set or Map additions, please?

Keep us posted with your testing/assessment, please.

Cheers

Russell
