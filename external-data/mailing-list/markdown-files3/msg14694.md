Hi Luke,

Same error:

bucket = client.bucket\_type('animals').bucket('cats')
bucket.enable\_search()
bucket.set\_property('search\_index', 'famous') # NEW: Setting the search
index to the bucket
key = bucket.new('feliz', data={"name":"Felix","species":"Felis catus"},
content\_type='application/json')
key.store()
print bucket.search('name=Felix')

Output:
