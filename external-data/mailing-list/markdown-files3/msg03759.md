Hello

I'm new to reply and Ruby in general, so probably my questions have evident
answers.
I'm trying to use the Document Model, but there are a few things that are
not clear from
the documentation:
1. How to configure ripple when used in a ruby (not rails) application.
2. I want to do something similar to the get\_or\_new method provided by the
Bucket (get an existing document or create a new one, it it doesn't exists)
3. control the bucket on which the document is stored/retrieve (using an
attribute). From what I've seen, riak uses the class name as bucket.

Thanks in advance
