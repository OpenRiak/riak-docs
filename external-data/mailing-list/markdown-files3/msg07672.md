I'd recommend calling update\_metadata with an empty dict. Be sure
to set the content\_type as well.

There are definitely cases where the user wants to choose one metadata
over another, or perhaps more commonly, "merge" them together, according
to some conflict resolution semantics. The client provides `update\_metadata`
for this reason. `select\_sibling/2` can be used to choose a particular 
{Metadata, Value}
pair as well.
