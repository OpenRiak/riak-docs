Hello all,

Riak S2 2.1 (aka Riak CS) is available. Thanks to all who made it happen!

Here are the highlights of the release:
\* New metrics that enable you to determine the health of your Riak S2
system, as well as get reports on your storage utilization per bucket
or user.
\* Garbage collection refinements
\* A module-level hook point for limiting user access and quota usage
\* General availability of multi-bag, now known as supercluster
