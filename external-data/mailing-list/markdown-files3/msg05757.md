Yes, it doesn't have a list. I'm not sure if it is worth rectifying that
yet. Here should be fine for now.

I've actually been considering doing this as well, for similar reasons.
I don't see a problem with doing it.

I think that might be overkill, but I suppose it's acceptable.

Technically, this won't happen because lager uses sync\_notify, which
means the log call blocks until all the backends have handled it.
However, this \*does\* mean that long log formatting calls in the
gen\_event will probably cause logging calls to block \*more\*.

What about doing the format string formatting in the calling process,
\*once\*, and then just sending along the rest of the data (timestamp,
callsite information, trace attributes, etc) with the output from doing
the string formatting? That should be the meat of the formatting anyway,
and I'd like to make sure we only do it once (we actually do it twice at
the moment, if a trace matches).

I think overall this is the path Lager is going to have to tread.

I'd rather balance Lager in the direction of flexibility and power over
performance, but egregious bottlenecks shouldn't be tolerated if there's
something that can be done to fix them. Lager is really about \*safely\*
logging messages, making them easy to read and being operationally
powerful. It already lags the competitors in performance, for the most
part, because of things it does to further these goals.

I have some simple performance testing code here:

https://github.com/Vagabond/logbench

But it's fairly unscientific right now, and needs some rewriting. I've
also got a half-finished benchmark blogpost comparing lager to the
alternatives, which also needs some rewriting.

So the TLDR is; I think you're on the right path, go ahead and make the
changes and I'll certainly review them for inclusion. If you don't I'll
probably end up doing something similar anyway, but it'll take longer
(I have other projects at basho to complete ATM).
