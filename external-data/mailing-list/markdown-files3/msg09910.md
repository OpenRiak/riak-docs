Hi Charlie,

That really helps to clear the confusion. Thanks again!

Then it comes to the next question :-) Just curious to know: is there a
special reason why using the end value as the partition's name? Normally,
most people I think would pick the beginning value as the partition's name
in common logic.

And a second question related to the above question is how this end value
is picked: partition named "0" is actually ending with number 0, and so
forth for the other partitions. This is like the 160-bit space got
right-shifted one number relative to 0-started numbering system. Is there
a special reason for it in Riak, or simply want to use 1-started numbering
system.


wr, donald
