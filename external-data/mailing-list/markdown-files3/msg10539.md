Hi,

First congratulations for open-sourcing Riak CS !

Thanks to the "fast track" docs I now have a vagrant VM which runs Riak CS
and I have been able to define admin credentials. Now I'm trying to use the
whole thing with s3cmd as proposed in
http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Testing-the-Installation/
;
"s3cmd --configure" and "s3cmd ls" work fine, though it doesn't return
anything since I have no bucket for now. I use s3cmd v1.5.0-alpha1
installed with the tarball.

When I try to create a bucket I get the following error: "ERROR: S3 error:
405 (Method Not Allowed):"

You can see a full trace here, trying to create a "zbucket" :
https://gist.github.com/jbbarth/5213352

I'm not very familiar with riak/webmachine/s3cmd for now. I imagine Riak CS
is not happy with the "PUT" HTTP verb, is it expected behaviour ? Maybe
there is something obvious I missed ? Any idea is welcome.

Thanks,

Jean-Baptiste
