Riak users,

Riak 1.4.6 was pushed to the apt and yum repositories and is now available for 
download from docs.basho.com.

Along with bug fixes, the most notable changes involve 2i. We have reverted to 
unsorted key lists by default for better performance, added regular expression 
filters for range queries, and now leverage our active anti-entropy (AAE) 
mechanism to repair 2i indexes.

The complete release notes can be found here:

https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.4/RELEASE-NOTES.md


Lastly, the downloads can be found on our docs page:

Thanks to everyone in the community. We at Basho greatly appreciate your 
interest in Riak and the enthusiastic support you provide to other users.

-Team Basho
