Thanks for sending over the asp.net app.config. Could you also send over
the app.config from your riak installation?

>From what you're saying, I'm pretty sure one of two things is happening:

1) Your VMs don't have permission to communicate with wherever your .NET
code is running.
2) Your Riak installation hasn't been set up to listen on those IP
addresses.

CorrugatedIron will happily attempt to talk to a tree stump until it times
out after exhausting the retry attempts + timeout period. Tree stumps don't
have ports ;)
