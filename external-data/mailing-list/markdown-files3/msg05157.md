I have a super alpha implementation of a distributed counter based on riak
core and implemented similar to how it is done in cassandra. It is missing
lots of feature including read repair and is probably very very buggy. I
have kind of given up on because i didn't see a nice solution to the lost
update/duplicate operation problem. I have put it up on github and if anyone
wants some inspiration. I think statebox might be a better way to go.
However, for some use cases the objects can get very large, very fast and i
think pruning the history safely is a tricky problem. Depending on your use
case a better solution might be just to write a transaction log to riak
using separate keys and then just map reduce to get the total and use a
caching layer if that is too slow.
