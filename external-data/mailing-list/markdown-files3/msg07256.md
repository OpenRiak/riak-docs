Riak is one of the simplest KV stores I used so far. Almost zero learning
curve
and ease of setup makes it a great tool to start working with. Moreover,
later you
got rewarded by an outstanding stability and minimal maintenance even at
large
scale.

So, the only obstacle I see in adoption of Riak lays in understanding the
general
datastore design principles using KV store, which probably is better to be
explained by thoughtful examples.

IMHO, it'll be nice for newbies to have an online live demo system(s)
populated
with some actual data and based on Riak  and
Webmachine,
allowing playing
with
it both manually and programmatically.
Such demo will serve as display of applied Riak data design patterns.
