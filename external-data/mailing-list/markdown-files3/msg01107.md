js\_reload will force a reload of all the Javascript VMs. This will dump all 
state, including any accumulated anonymous functions. We do cache anonymous 
functions to reduce the number of JS calls we have to make but it's possible 
there's a bug in the change detection logic. I will take a look in that code 
and see if we're doing anything obviously wrong. What version of Riak are you 
using?
