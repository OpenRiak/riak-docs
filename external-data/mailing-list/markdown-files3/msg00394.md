Hum... i'm reading again "Replication" section on the wiki, and i found 
that the behaviour i described seems to be a "read repair".


Sorry for the disturbing.

Hi,

I have a 3 nodes cluster and I simulated a complete lost of one node 
(node3, erase of the entire hard disk).
I installed it again, i launche a "riak console", "riak-admin join 
r...@node2", i waited a while to see the recovering of datas on node3 
which was freshly repaired, but no datas were created.


I decided to request a document on my bucket via node3 - to verify the 
availability of datas -, datas are available and i was suprised that 
the datas were created at this exact time on node3.


Is a normal behavior ? If it's normal, why ?

Me and my questions wish you all the best ;)

Regards,
Germain
