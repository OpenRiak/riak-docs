If you can't wait for native geo-spatial indexes, there are also numerous
techniques for creating them over distributed hash tables (like Riak). In
some limited use-cases, you could create flat indexes directly in Riak,
where the keys are named for the distance along a space-filling curve (like
Hilbert, Lebesgue/Z-curve or Peano). The flat-index technique plays nicely
with Riak's existing MapReduce query system.
