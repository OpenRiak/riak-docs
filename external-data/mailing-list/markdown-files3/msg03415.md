Jeremiah,

I sure hope you have not been drinking mouthwas.

The wiki is indeed showing single key filters, and that's confusing. In 
hindsight, it confused me too when I worked with key filters from the wiki page 
for the first time. I'll make sure we put some proper examples on that page to 
clarify how they should end up looking when multiple are put together. 

The bottom line is that Ripple does produce proper key filter code with 
conditions and that you are absolutely correct in bringing up this slight 
confusion.
