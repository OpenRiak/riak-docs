Hi Paul,

I just wanted to let you know that I'm currently investigating this and
will get back to you shortly.

I've opened the following issue for tracking it:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_control/issues/128

In addition, in retrospect I've realized that using the "incompatible"
language is a bit misleading -- only a subset of functionality becomes
unavailable when Control detects a possible incompatibility, and this is
usually limited to display a node's memory utilization (leaving management
commands unaffected.)

I've opened the following issue for tracking updating the language to
provide a less ambiguous, more concrete, display of what is actually
happening within the cluster:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_control/issues/127

Thanks for being so patient and diligent with testing our latest releases!

- Chris
