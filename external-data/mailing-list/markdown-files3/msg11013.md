Hey Chris,

We feel your pain. In fact, there's open an issue to fix this (though
it might have been hard to find as it's been open for five months).

https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/issues/256

When you have a moment, add some more ammo to the end of that issue. I
don't think we'll be able to get it into the imminent 1.4 release, but
I'll try to get it looked at in the coming weeks.

Thanks for reporting.

Mark
