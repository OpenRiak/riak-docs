Elias,

I'm not convinced that either the quorum or the number of nodes has
any significance to the appearance of that problem. In order for the
if\_not\_modified to work over PBC, the submitted vector clock must be
equal to the one that Riak finds. As you say, the internal get for
purposes of this comparison does not currently pass through any R/PR
quorum parameters and so will use the bucket defaults.

So, it seems like the correct semantics would be to compare whether
the partial orders of the vclocks relate, instead of being strictly
equal. It would be probably be valid to continue the PUT if both
replies from the internal get are older than the submitted vclock.

Am I following your line of reasoning correctly?
