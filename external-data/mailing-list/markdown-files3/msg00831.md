Hi Dmitry,

Being able to represent any Erlang term is a good start.

Which leads me to Riak's conflict resolution. Does this part of Riak
understand the data types or does it just present the N alternative
values for a key to the client when there is a conflict?

There is potential for some semi-automated merging to be done
server-side in the case where values have richer semantics. I suspect
that it would depend on the application, and the client would need to
tell Riak it's OK to perform an automatic merge on write.
