Just pushed a branch for this[1]: turned out to be really easy, a KeyIndex is 
just a BinIndex with no suffix. You use it like this

 val keys = 
bucket.fetchIndex(KeyIndex.index).from(startKey).to(endKey).execute();

Sorry that it is not going to be any use to you, but thanks for the spur to add 
it!

No, no there isn't.
