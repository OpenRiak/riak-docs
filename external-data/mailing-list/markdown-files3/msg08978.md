What is the 'eventually consistent' result of simultaneous inserts of
different values for a new key at different nodes? Does partitioning
affect this case?

What happens if the partitioning that riak is so concerned about
happens between the inserter and the lock - or the nodes providing
redundancy for the lock?

If you have more than one writer, doesn't this need to be just as
distributed and robust as riak?
