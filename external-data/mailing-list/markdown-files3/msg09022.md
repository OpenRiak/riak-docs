Hi Sebastian,

the way you proposed just works. I used this myself a lot lately.
For us the reason why we don't want to restart a node for this, is that 
it takes about 40 minutes to load all keys into memory.


Cheers,
Nico

Hey list,

I'd like to reconfigure the bitcask merge\_window. But I'd like to avoid to 
restart the nodes. I have no particular restriction, why I cannot restart the 
riak process, but I'd like to know if and how this would work.

Reading some riak/bitcask code I'd say that I just have to attach to riak and 
issue: application:set\_env(bitcask, merge\_window, {23, 3}). My question is, is 
this the way to go? Is it safe to run this and to change this setting while the 
system is running?



Best

Sebastian
