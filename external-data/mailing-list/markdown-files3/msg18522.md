Dear All,
I have made the Vagrantfiles available for the VMs used to build the Riak KV 
2.2.5rc2 packages available from https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.2/2.2.5rc2 
(only successful builds are available here)
The Vagrantfiles can be accessed at 
https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/Riak-Package-Builders-Vagrant/ and as well as the 
above builds, also include some machines with issues noted in the relevant 
Readme files.

Best regards,

Nicholas
