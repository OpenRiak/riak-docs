Yes it is.

To enable search on a bucket do any of the things you mentioned (add the hook, 
set {'search': true}, run search-cmd install my\_bucket.)

search-cmd install sets the 'search' bucket property to true. The presence of a 
true search bucket property cause the search pre-commit hook to be added to the 
bucket's properties. Likewise, if the pre-commit hook is present but the search 
property is not, the search property is set to true (for example after an 
upgrade.)

Have a look at the code in riak\_search\_kv\_hook.erl[1] specifically the fixup/2 
fun[2].

Cheers
