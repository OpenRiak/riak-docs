Francisco,

The answer is to make your client submit multiple Link headers, which Riak will 
join together. Watch what happens if I do that with curl:

$ curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8098/riak/test/one -H "Content-Type: 
text/plain" -d 'Hello,world' -H 'Link: ; riaktag="next"' -H 
'Link: ; riaktag="previous"' 
\* About to connect() to localhost port 8098 (#0)
\* Trying ::1... Connection refused
\* Trying fe80::1... Connection refused
\* Trying 127.0.0.1... connected
