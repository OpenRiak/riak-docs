Anyone else care to share their setup? Or have any questions about
what your dev setup should look like?


For the general and common cases of testing - ie development,
verifying application and cluster behavior in case of failures etc a
simple "make devrel" works fine for me. I run Riak directly on my MBP.

As others have pointed out - load testing and tuning for production is
another story.


What would have to be changed from the devrel version to get something 
where you could simply add other nodes to migrate to production - and 
maybe eventually remove the originals?
