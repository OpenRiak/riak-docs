Deleting a bucket takes forever in any Riak client if the bucket has a lot
of values in it. This is because a bucket isn't an object that is any way
analogous to a "table" like you'd see in an RDBMS and to delete a bucket
the keys in that bucket need to be listed first (please correct me if I'm
wrong people!). This operation is known to be slow and using it is not
recommended.

CorrugatedIron outputs warning messages to the debug console whenever
ListKeys or DeleteBucket are called. I'd recommend heeding those warnings
and look to take a different approach.
