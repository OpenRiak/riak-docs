Afternoon, Evening, Morning to All -

Here's a tidy Recap for the last week. Also, we have nine (9) tickets
left for RICON. Get yours before they are gone:
ricon-east-2013.eventbrite.com/

If you can't make the conference proper, make sure you're at the after
party on Monday night: http://ricon.io/east.html#after\_party

Enjoy. And I'll see some of you next week in New York City at RICON...
