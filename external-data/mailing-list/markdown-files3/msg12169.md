Hello, I have managed to successfully build riak from github source. In my
repository I now have rel/ directory. The guide at
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/installing/post-install/
instructs
to add the bin/directory to the PATH. My question is what files/directories
are actually needed? If I want to move the built release somewhere, what
files do I need to move?

Thanks!
Konstantin
