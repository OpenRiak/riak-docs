Riak 2.1.1 has been released. All package repositories are updated as
is the documentation[0]

Riak 2.1.0 introduced a bug that has been fixed in Riak 2.1.1 [1]. The
default configuration for handoff.ip caused vnodes marked for transfer
during handoff to be removed without transferring data to their new
destination nodes. A mandatory change to configuration (riak.conf)
mitigates this issue for 2.1.0 users. While not all users were
impacted by this issue, we recommend that all 2.1.0 users upgrade to
2.1.1.
