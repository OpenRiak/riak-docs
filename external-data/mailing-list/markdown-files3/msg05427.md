I'm new to Riak so please forgive a newbie question. I searched the email 
archives and did not see a discussion about this...

I will setup several VMWare Ubuntu instances to run a Riak ring so I can 
perform some testing and then development.

What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of using the binary DEB 
package compared to building from source?
