Sheraz,

Luke is absolutely correct. We made the decision quite a while ago to move on 
from trying to support runtime versions earlier than 4.0 because we felt it was 
having an impact on the code. .NET 2.0 comes with its own headaches, and we 
felt that we should avoid them rather than letting things suffer unnecessarily.

Also, given that Riak was relatively new, and new to the .NET world when CI was 
first released obviously, we felt that it’d be more than likely that any .NET 
applications that were going to use Riak would themselves be new; Greenfields 
as it were. That being the case, anyone building such applications would most 
likely use the latest version of .NET themselves, which at the time of the 
decision was already 4.0.

You’re the first person in well over a year to request support for .NET 2! So 
as you can see, it’s not really that sought after, and hence I doubt you’ll see 
any support for .NET versions older than 4.0.

Cheers.
OJ

Hi Sheraz, 

The CorrugatedIron client uses .NET 4-specific features. This thread 
explains why Unity3D is "stuck" on .NET 2: 

http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity3d-in-net-framework-4-0.230746/ 

At this point in time I would recommend your game server run in an 
application server (IIS or windows host) targeting the .NET 2 
framework, and have data access in a different process targeting .NET 
4.0.
