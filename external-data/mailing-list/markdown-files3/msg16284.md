Hi Roman,

Which "process management system" are you using? I have successfully run
Riak using monit and the fact that Riak runs in the background does not
cause issues.

For instance, this monit configuration will start/stop Riak as well as
monitor it. You must disable your system's init script for Riak if you want
monit to do the job instead.

check process riak
 with pidfile /var/run/riak/riak.pid
 start program = "/etc/init.d/riak start" with timeout 30 seconds
 stop program = "/etc/init.d/riak stop" with timeout 60 seconds
 alert riak-ale...@domain.com
 on { connection, timeout }
 with mail-format {
 subject: [ALERT] $HOST: Riak Service - $EVENT
 message: $DATE
Problem:
$HOST: Riak raised the following event: $EVENT
$DESCRIPTION
 }
 with reminder on 10 cycles
 if failed (url http://localhost:8098/ping and content == '^OK$')
 with timeout 15 seconds
 for 2 times within 5 cycles
 then alert
 if 3 restarts within 5 cycles then alert
 group riak
