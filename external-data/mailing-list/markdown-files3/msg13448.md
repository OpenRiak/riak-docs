I look at it like this: if you can fit your entire database into memory and 
don't mind losing the entire thing when the server goes down or becomes 
unavailable and you like the extra functionality of Redis like hashes, 
counters, and messaging, then go with Redis. If you can't afford to lose the 
data you put into it and you need the availability of more than a single server 
and don't use the simple messaging of Redis, then go with Riak.

That said, the two are not direct competitors. They may have overlapping 
functionality in some areas but they each address fundamentally different 
concerns. 


Thanks!
