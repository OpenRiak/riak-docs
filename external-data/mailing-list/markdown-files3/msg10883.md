MapReduce works well when:

a) you know the set of objects you're going to MapReduce over
b) you need to return the entire object
c) when you plan to manipulate a lot of data inside Riak - read all sales
records and write them out as shipping invoices

because you need to scan the entire key space. Much like a SELECT with no
WHERE clause, a MapReduce without a key list is going to sweep across the
entire bucket pulling all data off of disk in the process. Someone better
versed in Riak internals would have to chime in on why this is so slow.

I do know, however, that having on master bucket o' things may not be the
best idea. If you're storing sales data, a better approach may be to
segment buckets out by primary querying criteria.

MapReduce can aggregate well. RDBMSes can aggregate well, too. But there
are practical limits to each paradigm that you have to be aware of. From
watching the list and working with people in the real world there are some
paradigms that you want to use in Riak that don't immediately seem obvious
coming from the RDBMS world.

- Know your queries. Examine your application and make a list of common
queries that you're going to be running. You'll want to be familiar with
this list because you're going to try to write your data in a way that
answers these questions.
- Know your query pattern. Understand how these queries are working with
the data itself. If many queries retrieve data aggregated for a day, week,
month, store, sales region, or other logical division then you'll want to
make sure that you can answer them quickly. (See Choosing the Right Tool
[3])
- Pre-aggregate your data. If you know you're going to have to perform
averages, you may want to look interesting ways to write your data (see
Rolling with Eventual Consistency [1] and Little-Known Awesome Algorithms:
Fenwick Trees â€“ Rapidly Find Cumulative Frequency Sums [2]).

MR can be slow since all records need to be streamed through the
originating node. Using pre-reduce[4] can ease the load
