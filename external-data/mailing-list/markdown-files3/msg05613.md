Because of the way riak stores a key's value as basically one big blob 
in one place on disk, I don't think it is possible. This is akin to 
the often requested ability to update a keys meta data independent of 
its "value". But as far as riak storage is concerned there is no real 
difference between meta data and "value".


Couldn't riak add a feature where I can pass a javascript function to 
riak? This function knows how I store my data, so it can parse the value 
in place, add new secondary indexes, and save the data. Riak could run 
these functions in parallel across all of my data (similar to map reduce).
