Thanks Christian.
We do indeed use mapreduce but it's a fairly simple function:
We retrieve a first object whose value is an array of at most 10 ids and
then we fetch all the values for these 10 ids.
However, this mapreduce job is quite rare (maybe 10 times a day at most at
this point...) so I don't think that's our issue.
I'll try to run the cluster without any call to that to see if that's
better, but I'd be very surprised. Also, we were doing this already even
before we allowed for multiple value and the cluster was stable back then.
We do not do key listing or anything like that.

I'll try looking at the statistics too.

Thanks,
