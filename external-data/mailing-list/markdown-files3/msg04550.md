2) The Chicago Boss Web Framework now supports Riak as a backend.

3) This is a ways off but still worth relaying: Jon Brisbin will be
giving a talk on Riak and evented data with RabbitMQ at the Springone
conference in Chicago at the end of October.

4) There will be a half day Riak training at the upcoming Surge
Conference in Baltimore happening at the end of September. The best
part about this is that it's free with your registration (and Surge's
lineup looks downright amazing).

5) Duncan McGreggor has a new repo up on Launchpad that connects Riak
to Django. Thanks, Duncan!
