Hey Marius,

To put it simply, yes, 2.1.1 does not support write\_once with search. Some 
objects will get indexed, but it will take a very long time and there will be 
issues with the cluster, etcâ€¦

There should have been a note about this. Our apologies. We have solved the 
issue, and it will be supported in 2.1.2, which is our next release. You can 
read more about it here: https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/issues/512 
. 

Thanks.
