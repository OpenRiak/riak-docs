Hi list!

I do not want to dig deep in the Riak source code now, so I'm sking this
question here. These are my needs:

- objects are stored as Erlang terms (say as gb\_tree or proplists)
- GET with "accept" header set to "application/json" returns JSON
- GET with "accept" header set to "application/x-erlang-binary" returns
Erlang binary
- GET with "accept" header set to "application/xml" returns some XML
- GET with "accept" header set to "plain/text" returns text representation

Is it possible to create a "represention" hook without modification the
current source code of the webmachine callback modules? Is there a fork
of the code related to this issue?
