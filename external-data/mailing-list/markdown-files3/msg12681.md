Hi
I installed riak v1.4.2 on ubuntu12.04(64bit, 4G RAM) with apt-get, run it 
with default app.conf but change the backend to leveldb, and test it with 
https://github.com/tpjg/goriakpbc . 
Just keep putting (key, value) to an bucket, the memory always increasing, and 
in the end it crashed, as it cannot allocate memory. 
Should i change the configuration or other?
