One other thing that might be worth mentioning here is the writes I’m 
mentioning are actually updates to existing objects. The object exists, an 
attempt to write an update for the object appears to be received by a node, but 
the object maintains it’s original value.

Any help you can provide to debug this would be greatly appreciated. thank you!
