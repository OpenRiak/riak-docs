Hi Sean ,

What would the perform issues be with setting a ring size to 1024 (instead of 
128 or 256) on a 6 node cluster? 

I can see the possibility of memory overflow (which is not a high concern on a 
128G machine ) , but other than that , are there any additional concerns (with 
Bitcask) ? 

I'm trying to understand if there is a significant performance degradation with 
a value of 1024 versus future proofing growth.

Cheers,

John
