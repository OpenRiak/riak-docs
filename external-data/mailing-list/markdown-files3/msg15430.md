It was enabled by default - we didn't change this value when creating the
bucket. The only properties on the bucket that we changed were allow\_mult
and last\_write\_wins.

Further update - yesterday we also noticed in the logs that one of our
keys, its JSON had grown to 17MB after some load tests, we hadn't expected
it to be that size and wouldn't normally grow to that in production (it's
just a side issue of the load testing scenario) - however we know that is a
huge key for Riak, so we deleted it and now the random timeouts on the keys
we were having have stopped... could that large key be manifesting an issue
down the line on accessing other keys? The large key would be fetched as
part of our test scenario, but maybe the issue isn't bubbling up until one
of the smaller keys is accessed?
