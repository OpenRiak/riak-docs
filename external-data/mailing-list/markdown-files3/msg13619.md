I have the same use case as Massimiliano. We are using the java client and
our app runs on the same servers as the Riak cluster. We have found that
connecting to the Riak instance running on local host provides the best
performance. It would be nice if the cluster client could be told to prefer
one node, and fall back to other nodes if needed kind of like secondary DNS
servers.
