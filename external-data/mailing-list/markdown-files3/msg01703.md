Have you guys seen the zeromq library? It's a fast, brokerless message
passing library (the sender can talk directly to the recipient, without a
message queue server in the middle). That plus protocol buffers might be an
easy way to call out to arbitrary code for mapreduce work, and you'd get the
ability to make the recipient local or remote. Their user guide actually
suggests that it was inspired by erlang.
