Thanks much Matthew. Yes the server is low-memory given only development
right now - I'm using an AWS micro instance, so 1 GB RAM and 1 vCPU.

Thanks for the tip - let me try move the manifest file to a larger instance
and see how that works. More than reducing the memory footprint in dev, my
concern was more around reacting to a possible production scenario where
the db stops responding due to memory overload. Understood now that moving
to a larger instance should be possible. Thanks again.
