Well, I guess they're working on it -
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/nodes/adding-removing/#The-Node-Join-Process-
but for now, that's just something we have to live with during node

Also, I guess, if you do it all in one go, it just finishes faster,
decreasing the time period where inconsistencies are expected.
