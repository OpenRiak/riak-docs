Hello Baskar, Santi.

I’d definitely like to know what your AAE status is like, as per my last email. 
The fix here may just be clearing the AAE trees and rebuilding them.

Yes, index creation is currently async and you have to wait for it to be 
created before sending data. You can poll to check for the index, similar to 
this function used in the search java-client tests, 
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/blob/89778ae5a2274ce8693709bcc4c5ea3558d72971/src/test/java/com/basho/riak/client/core/operations/itest/ITestBase.java#L264
 
.
 We do something similarly in our erlang tests for search. 

I’m not aware of a better way right now. Currently, I’m actually working on 
making index creation synchronous before returning a response (within a 
timeout), which could solve your issues.

Thanks.
