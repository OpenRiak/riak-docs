Hi,
we came across a question on RIAK's querying ability thru JAVA client.
For example, I have the below JSON record in a RIAK bucket.
I need the individual counts of 'tasks' across different 'statuses'. Like for 
the below JSON record, it would be...

- Completed Tasks - 3, InProgress Tasks - 2 and OnHold Tasks -1
What is best way to retrieve this information in Java from RIAK ?

{
 "csOutageID" : "110022",
 "outageType" : "Value Pack",
 "equipmentSerialNumber" : "297912",
 "siteName" : "Zhejiang Fuel Gas Power Gen Ltd.",
 "technicalCode" : "HD Gas",
 "contractNumber" : "CS21753",
 "taskCategory" : [{
 "taskCategoryId" : "1",
 "taskCategoryName" : "TIL",
 "taskList" : [{
 "taskTaskID" : "1000",
 "taskTitle" : "ML 0434 
HYDRAULIC SYSTEM SETTING OF THE ACCUMULATOR REFILL RATE",
 "taskStatus" : "Complete",
 }, {
 "taskTaskID" : "1001",
 "taskTitle" : "MLI 0104 - HOSE, 
CHARGING, ACCUMULATOR",
 "taskStatus" : "OnHold",
 }]
 }, {
 "taskCategoryId" : "2",
 "taskCategoryName" : "HOTLIST",
 "taskList" : [{
 "taskTaskID" : "1002",
 "taskTitle" : "TEMPERATURE 
REGULATION VALVES CONTAINING METHYLENE CHLORIDE",
 "taskStatus" : "InProgress",
 }, {
 "taskTaskID" : "1003",
 "taskTitle" : "MSDS Methylene 
Chloride to be added in O&M",
 "taskStatus" : "Complete",
 }]
 }, {
 "taskCategoryId" : "2",
 "taskCategoryName" : "HOTLIST",
 "taskList" : [{
 "taskTaskID" : "1004",
 "taskTitle" : "MIXING 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SERIES CELLS IN LS2100 AND INNOVATION SERIES STATIC 
STARTERS",
 "taskStatus" : "InProgress",
 }, {
 "taskTaskID" : "1005",
 "taskTitle" : "BUCKET LOCKWIRE 
REDESIGN AND DOWEL PIN ASSEMBLY AND INSPECTION PROCEDURES",
 "taskStatus" : "Complete",
 }]
 }]
}

Thanks & regards,
Prem
