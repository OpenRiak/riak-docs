Kaspar -

Unfortunately it's worse than that. The reason it's doing that is because 
that's how the underlying, original Protobuf client is handling things - it 
uses ByteString.copyFromUtf8() on Strings that are passed to store(), fetch(), 
etc as the key.

Basically, above com.basho.riak.pbc.RiakClient there's simply not a way to use 
a non-UTF8 encoded String currently.

The problem with what you propose is that it requires modifying the higher 
level interfaces which will of course break code built on top of them (we have 
users who have built things on top of these interfaces). This is not something 
we want to do in a minor point release. 

That being said, there's a few things we'd like to change in the client but 
haven't for this same reason. Along with the Riak 1.2 release we'll be cutting 
the 1.0.6 release of the Java client. After that, I'd be willing to look into 
what it would take to sanely allow for arbitrary byte arrays to be used as keys 
for a 1.1 client release that would include other interface breaking changes.

Thanks,
Brian Roach
