Shahar,

Some of those functions are built-in to the JS runtime. You can refer
to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference for
information about built-in functions. Note that the runtime included
with Riak is Spidermonkey 1.8.1, so it will not include some of the
JavaScript 1.5 features.
