Hi all,

I am taking on a new role at my company, and unfortunately cannot find
enough time to pursue riak-js. It's been a long (and fun) ride, and
I'm kinda sad to have to announce this.

A complete Javascript rewrite (
https://github.com/frank06/riak-js/tree/js ) is 90% there but I really
can't find the time to finish it.

Who would like to step up and take the lead on the project?

(I'm open to a knowledge transfer session explaining the concepts and
status of the code)

Let me know!

Thanks,
Francisco
