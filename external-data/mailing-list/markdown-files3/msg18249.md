Dear Riak Users,

I would kindly request your review on a few pull requests I opened in
the semi-official Basho Ansible scripts repo at
basho-labs/ansible-riak. If you have the permissions, I would also
appreciate the merging.

The main pull request automates Riak KV Search (Solr) configuration:
https://github.com/basho-labs/ansible-riak/pull/89

My other PRs are listed in https://github.com/basho-labs/ansible-riak/pulls

Thanks and regards
Luca
