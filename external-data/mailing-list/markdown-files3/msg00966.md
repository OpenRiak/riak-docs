Your choice should be dictated by your use-case. In most situations, 
"riak\_kv\_bitcask\_backend" (the default) will work for you. It stores data on 
disk in a fast (append-only) log-structured file format. If your data is 
transient or doesn't need to persist across restarts (and needs to be fast), 
try "riak\_kv\_ets\_backend" or "riak\_kv\_cache\_backend"; the latter uses a global 
LRU timeout. If you want to use several of the backends in the same cluster 
(for different buckets), use the "riak\_kv\_multi\_backend" and configure each 
backend separately.
