Hello. A small update to this issue:

While Alex is correct, that "fitting was gone before startup" messages
in Riak logs can be a symptom of an overloaded cluster, they are most
often nothing more than spam right after an MR query reaches its
timeout. That is why I've just merged a change for the next version of
Riak that lowers that message from 'error' to 'debug' level.

https://github.com/basho/riak\_pipe/pull/75

Look forward to less noise in your logs soon.

Cheers,
Bryan
