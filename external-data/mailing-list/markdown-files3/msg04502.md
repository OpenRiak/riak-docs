I'm having trouble simply posting a response to this list. This is my 3rd 
attempt so if anyone is being spammed, I'm sorry, but I'm just not seeing the 
replies and I keep getting rejection notices from the list managerâ€¦

Here we go again:

Hi Lukas,

Sorry it has taken me so long to join this party, I have been away and I'm just 
catching up.

No, there is no cache.

I don't understand what you're doing here? If you want the object you stored, 
why not just returnBody=true for the store operation?

You really need to do this with n\_val, r, w, dw all = 1 and allow\_mult=false 
and no other clients? Something is wrong. Please let me know what version of 
the RJC you are using and what version of Riak on what erlang/OS/arch etc. I'd 
like to try this at home as storing data and retrieving is what we are all 
about and this should \*just work\* (we have integration tests like this and they 
\*DO\* work.) 

Forgive me if I am teaching you to suck eggs here, but right at the start 
there, when you store the "riakIndex" object, is there a chance it already 
exists? 
Does the bucket have allow\_mult set to false? 
Do you fetch before your store (if you use the new RJC it does a fetch before a 
store to handle the vector clock for you)? 
Are you attempting to overwrite an existing value but providing a stale vclock? 
If you have allow\_mult set to false and try and write your object with a stale 
vclock your write will be silently dropped. Likewise, if you provide \*no\* 
vclock but a clientId that already has a write on that key, your write will be 
dropped. I realise this can be confusing at first, but does it explain the 
behaviour you're seeing?

For fun, try this:

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k

(404)

curl -v -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k -d"a"

(204)

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k

(200) a

curl -v -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k -d"b"

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/b/k

(200) b

BUT do the same thing with a clientId header set

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k -H"X-Riak-ClientId: pete"

(404)

curl -v -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k -d"a" -H"X-Riak-ClientId: pete"

(204)

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k -H"X-Riak-ClientId: pete"

(200) a

curl -v -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k -d"b" -H"X-Riak-ClientId: pete"

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/c/k

(200) a (HUH?)

Does that explain any of what you see?

A well behaved client will always fetch before store, and will use the 
vlcock/clientId. The new RJC does this for you behind the scenes. See 
http://blog.basho.com/2011/07/14/The-All-New-Riak-Java-Client/ and 
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/blob/master/README.org for more 
details.

What is your use case? When you go into production will you have multiple 
nodes? Will you have allow\_mult set to true? Let me know what I can do to help, 
'cos it is great to see someone else using the Java client and I want to make 
it easy for you to do so. 

It would be far simpler to start defining you strategy for resolving 
conflicting writes/sibling values than it would be to try and acheive 100% 
consistency in a distributed, fault tolerant database.

Cheers

Russell
