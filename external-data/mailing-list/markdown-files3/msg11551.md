Changing the n\_val setting in the default bucket properties will only affect 
new PUT operations moving forward. Older replicas will not be removed, and the 
AAE process will not purge older, unneeded replicas.

It's possible that the fallback virtual node will be started on the same 
physical node that originally hosted the third primary, however, it will be a 
different virtual node and backend directory as these are parameterized based 
on partition identifier and node.
