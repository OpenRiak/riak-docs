With Eric's suggestion, I re-ran my test using R=1, and the read
performance got much better. Those results can be seen here:

If you compare Riak using the LRU cache backend and Membase, it
Membase is still roughly twice as fast for this particular test.

Not being intimately familiar Riak yet, there is definitely some small
amount of overhead per request, the sum of which becomes apparent in
my test. Basically, if you subtract network latency from my tests, and
you are working with objects that are purely resident in RAM then
whatever operations Membase must perform to retrieve an object versus
Riak seem to show that Riak is doing more work to fetch that object,
as Ryan mentioned in his email the other day.

I guess I was just naively assuming that for objects resident in
memory, regardless of the technology, retrieval times would be fairly
consistent.

If anyone has any other tips, I would definitely be interested to try
them. We have concerns about Membase presently too, though performance
is not one of them presently, my data feels "safer" in Riak and I'm
still interested to see if I can make it work the way we need.

Thanks!
