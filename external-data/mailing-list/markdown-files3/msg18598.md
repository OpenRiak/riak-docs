Dear All,
Just following up to say that initial rc5 package builds for Rhel/CentOS 6/7 
and Ubuntu Bionic are now available from 
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.9/2.9.0rc5/
Packages for other operating systems will be available at the same link by the 
end of the week.

Best regards,

Nicholas

Subject: [ANN] Riak 2.9.0 - Release Candidate 5 Available

Release Candidate 5 for 2.9.0 is now available on github. It is available to 
build from source here - https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0rc5.

Apologies for the churn of release candidates on 2.9.0. This is as a result of 
issues discovered in the leveled refactoring in RC2, having side-effects during 
big handoff events with high transfer limits.

All usual caveats arise. This is a release intended for testing in 
non-production environments.

Apologies for the ongoing delays getting this release through the test process.

Regards

Martin

P.S. A reminder that work on Release 3.0 is progressing, with a workshop being 
held this week to try and accelerate progress. Follow the #gothmeet2019 
channel on Riak slack for updates
