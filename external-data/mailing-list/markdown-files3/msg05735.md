I'm still interested in this problem (deletes lagging way behind inserts). Is 
there anything about the technology of Riak itself that might explain this, or 
is it instead something to do with the map/reduce phase in order to find keys 
to delete?

Andy indicated that the map part of what he was doing was really fast, but 
iterating deletes were the problem.

Perhaps spinning up a lot of concurrent deletes is the key?
