Hi Greg, I ran with 16384 to try and reproduce what you were attempting.

os\_mon is used by stats for reporting system utilization (cpu/disk etc) so
you're losing some insight into what is going on. Bottom line is it will
make troubleshooting harder. You may be ok if you can throw enough erlang
ports / file handles. I didn't have enough time to work out what the
bottleneck was.

Jon.
