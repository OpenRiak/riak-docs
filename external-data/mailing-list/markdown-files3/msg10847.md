With 3 nodes only if one of the nodes is down I should still be able to read
write if I'm doing that with default setting (quorum). Am I wrong.
I appreciate there is a case that SHA key space does not divide equally by 3
so there is a slim possibility that replicas for some keys would be on the
same physical hardware. But still, 99% of keys should be available. Right?
