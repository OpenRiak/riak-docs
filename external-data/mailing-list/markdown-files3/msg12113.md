Hello dear riak list.

Could you clarify my observation.
Recently we had an issue with corrupted data on riak. Instance was powered
off and after it became available we found some bad\_crc errors in logs. At
that moment we had 1.2.1-1 riak nodes in our cluster. After some googling we
found an issue on github and decided to upgrade riak to 1.4.1 to resolve
this issue (https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/385).
Everything went perfectly smooth, all nodes were upgraded.
As expected some messages regarded to active anti-entropy background work
has appeared in logs.
Since that date ~ two weeks had passed, but periodically I see in logs such
messages:

This is strange to me, because there was no other outages or any network
problems since that date. And one more interesting thing is that this
partition numbers (I believe?) are same all the time.
