Riak Users,

We are pleased to announce the availability of Riak 1.4.2. This is a
bugfix release based on the 1.4.x series of Riak.

The major subsystems with fixes are:


 - Fixed various problems related to crashing stats
 - Fixed extra noisy logs introduced in 1.4.1 (Not found errors and
 others)
 - Fixed issues related to 2i queries timing out
 - Added more protection against corrupt data in backends
 - Fixed incorrect capability negotiation causing nodes to appear
 incompatible in Riak Control
