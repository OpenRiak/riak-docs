Hi Gui,

I recently pushed 70 million records of size 1K each into a 5-node
Riak cluster (which was replicating to another 5-node cluster) at
around 1000 writes/second using basho\_bench and the REST interface. I
probably could have pushed it further, but I wanted to confirm that it
could maintain the load for the entire data set, which it did.

My point being that your speed-limit of 200 writes/second is likely
specific to your configuration.

I wonder:
1) what's your average write latency?
2) how big is your connection pool?

Because it's possible that you don't have enough connections available
to handle your desired load.
