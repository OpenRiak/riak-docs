I'm curious if there has been any talk to drop the protocol buffers
interface in favor of one of the more user-friendly serialization libraries
which support more languages, like Bert (http://bert-rpc.org/) or
MessagePack (http://msgpack.org/). I would think Bert is a perfect fit for
Riak since it uses native Erlang binary which would make exposing the Erlang
client pretty seamless. I'm not sure of the speed difference, but the fact
that Google only provides PB support in three languages seems to me to be a
bit of a hindrance.

Thoughts?
