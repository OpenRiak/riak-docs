Refresh my memory, does leveldb open new files for each bucket? I'm thinking 
there may be some file descriptor penalty for this many buckets. 

Otherwise you could set your default bucket properties to what you would want 
for these user buckets and then change properties if need be for a handful of 
other buckets you may need in your application.

Cheers,
