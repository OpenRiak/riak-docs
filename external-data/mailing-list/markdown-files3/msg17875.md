I have a 9-node Riak CS cluster that has been working flawlessly for about
3 months. The cluster configuration, including backend and bucket
parameters such as N-value are using default settings. I'm using the S3 API
to communicate with the cluster.

Within the past week I had an issue where two objects were PUT resulting in
a 200 (success) response, but all subsequent GET requests for those two
keys return status of 404 (not found). Other than the fact that they are
now missing, there was nothing out of the ordinary with these particular to
PUTs. Maybe I'm missing something, but this seems like a scenario that
should never happen. All information included here about PUTs and GETs
comes from reviewing the CS access logs. Both objects were PUT on the same
node, however GET requests returning 404 have been observed on all nodes.
There is plenty of other traffic on the cluster involving GETs and PUTs
that are not failing. I'm unsure of how to troubleshoot further to find out
what may have happened to those objects and why they are now missing. What
is the best approach to figure out why an object that was successfully PUT
seems to be missing?

Thanks!
Daniel Miller
