Thanks for the reply, I was able to work-around the problem based on your 
suggestion.

FYI: We're using the Amazon C# client and the problem was caused by specifying 
an empty string as the "delimiter" for the ListObjects function call. I 
switched to null & it works without issues now.

Regards,
Gautam

Hi Gautam,

Hmm... It seems like a bug. List objects fails when "delimiter" query parameter 
is empty like:
 http://foo.s3.amazonaws.com/?delimiter=

May I ask some questions?
- What client (s3cmd, s3curl, java sdk, etc...) do you use?
- Can you control the query parameter and remove it when its value is empty?

Thanks,
Shino
