Hi Jared,

The Execute method and the client object in general are thread-safe.
You can see an example here:

https://github.com/basho/riak-dotnet-client/blob/develop/src/RiakClientTests.Live/ParallelExample.cs

The next version of the client will have additional support for
batching command for execution.
