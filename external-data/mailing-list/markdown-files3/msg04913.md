Harshal,

I take it you are using the default backend, bitcask? If so you should know
it's an append only log format that is periodically merged. So until a
merge is triggered the data will only grow. Even if you delete objects it
still grows as a delete is actually just a special tombstone msg added to
the log.

You can read more about bitcask configuration here:
