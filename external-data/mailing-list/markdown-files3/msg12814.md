Vincent,

How large are the objects that you're requesting? (in the 1000 objs
example).
Also, what does your cluster configuration look like? How many nodes? Are
you load-balancing the GETs to your riak nodes (via something like
HAProxy), or are you making requests to a single riak node?

It sounds like the first thing to investigate, in your case, is - where is
the slowdown happening, on the client side or on the server side?
To get a reference data point on the cluster-side multiget performance, you
can use an external tool like https://github.com/basho/riak-data-migratoror
https://github.com/basho/basho\_bench to get a rough idea of how many
requests/sec your Riak cluster can handle.
For example, you can download the Data Migrator (which has pretty good
multithreaded connection-pooled GETs that use the Java Riak Client) and do
an export of your cluster (or the bucket in question), and look at the
resulting objs/sec number.

If the bottleneck turns out to be on the Ruby client side, you should
investigate JRuby for better multithreaded performance, or use a
concurrency library like Celluloid.
