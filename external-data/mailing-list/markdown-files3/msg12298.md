Sebastian,

There is no newer package. Can you tell me the following:

\* What debian version are you on?
\* What user did you run the above command on? Do they have root access?

>From that same user can you do this:

mkdir -p /etc/riak-cs && touch /etc/riak-cs/testfile && echo "success"

\* If you are running in a virtualized environment, what type is it?

The package script should be adding files to /etc/riak-cs before the chmod
command gets there, so something is fishy about the files not being added.
 Either the user or system has weird permissions on adding files to /etc/
or there is a bug in the package. Once you get back to me, I'll try to
reproduce on my end.

-Jared
