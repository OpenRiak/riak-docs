Hi,

I have to say it is nice, we started using it today and it seems to 
leave a very low CPU and memory footprint at both cluster and 
application using the client, now I have a couple of questions:


1. This one is probably part of Riak 1.4.x but won't hurt to ask: Will
 reduce identity (to count keys) MapReduce job use a streamed 2i
 input instead?
2. If I decide to stream index and keys (withReturnKeyAndIndex), how do
 I get a Collection/List of IRiakObject(s)?


Thanks,

Guido.
