I would check the coverage plans that are being used for the different queries, 
which you can usually see in the headers of the resulting document. When you 
run a search query though yokozuna, it will use a coverage plan from riak core 
to find a minimal set of nodes (and partitions) to query to get a set of 
results, and the coverage plan may change every few seconds. You might be 
hitting nodes that have inconsistencies or are in need of repair. Do you have 
AAE enabled?
