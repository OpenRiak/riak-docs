The drop of PB in the new js branch is for now just temporary. Allows us to 
focus on getting the JavaScript code base up to speed at least feature-wise and 
get a feeling for how things could evolve for its API. Help on getting PB 
support back into that branch is more than welcome! But I'll also be happy to 
look into it myself once the code in general is up to speed with the newest 
Riak feature set, for which I unfortunately don't have a specific timeline 
right now, as I'm still digging through the code, adding tests, completing 
features, etc.

Cheers, Mathias
