Hi

I'm setting up a Riak cluster on some EC2 servers running Ubuntu. The goal is 
to use autoscaling to make sure that I always have the right number of nodes 
online. 

When I kill one node (shut down the server, it's gone permanently) and then 
start a new server to replace it (with a new name) the new server can't join 
the cluster because it can't communicate with the dead node. It works if I 
manually mark the dead node as down and remove it form the cluster but I would 
like that to happen automatically (perhaps after a timeout). 

Do I have to write my own code that detects this situation and removes the dead 
node from the cluster or is there a way to configure Riak to do this for me?
