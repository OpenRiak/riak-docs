Hi Mark,

If you need to get the structure the data, your best bet is to pull the
content type. You'll need to list-keys [1] on that bucket and then parse
the header for each key with a HEAD request, paying special attention to
the content-type for the key [2]. Keep in mind we don't recommend using
list-keys for production, but if it's for test data and an offline-cluster,
it's fine. Make sure to use the "?keys=stream" option if the client you're
using supports it.

The biggest caveat here is that you're trusting the client that stored the
data initially to have specified the correct content type. Riak doesn't
 validate it proactively on the way in.

Hope that helps.

Mark
