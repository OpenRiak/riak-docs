Riak Users,

I'm happy to announce the first alpha release of Yokozuna. Yokozuna is a
new take on providing search support for Riak. It tightly integrates Solr
4.0.0 and the Riak master branch.

I'm very excited about Yokozuna. It brings the power of Solr search to
Riak. This means language support, analyzer support, and advanced querying
support including boolean, ranked, facet, and spatial. You can even query
Yokozuna with existing Solr clients\*! Basically, if Solr supports it
Yokozuna probably does too. On the other side of things Riak uses its
great distributed bits to replicate and scale out Solr. Riak provides
support for anti-entropy, handoff, distributed queries, and data
replication. Together these two technologies complement each other well.

Learn more about the 0.1.0 release:

Getting started with Yokozuna:

If you would rather not build from source an EC2 AMI is provided that may
be used: https://github.com/rzezeski/yokozuna/blob/master/docs/EC2.md

If you would like to see some very high-level diagrams of Yokozuna's
architecture checkout my slides from RICON:

I'm looking for people to work with me directly to prototype solutions
using Yokozuna. If that sounds interesting please email me directly. If
you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them on riak-users or email me
directly.
