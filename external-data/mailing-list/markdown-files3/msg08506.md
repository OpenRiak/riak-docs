Hey again list,

Can anyone recommend a process for either cloning a cluster, or backing up
a whole cluster's data to restore elsewhere? This would be incredibly
useful for creating a new environment to test upgrades and run application
regression testing.

In the dark old days, it would be a simple combination of mysqldump &
mysql..

Cheers
Matt
