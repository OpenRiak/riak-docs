Thanks, but i meant to run as foreground hidden process, without console.

I need to run riak kv under specific process management system which controls 
process live cycle. It cant do it if the process is backgrounded. 

I really dont want ti hack the riak runner wrapper so though maybe there us 
sine trick. 

But in any case, it seems surprising that this option is missing as a standard
