For anyone in or near Austin: Mark Phillips, Seth Thomas and I will be at Data 
Day tomorrow, and Seth and I will be hosting a meetup in three weeks at Mass 
Relevance. Please feel free to stop by either event and say hi.

I will be hosting more meetups in Texas this year, and I'll definitely be 
looking for users to talk about their experiences with Riak. Please let me know 
if you'd be interested in sharing your pain points and successes (not 
necessarily in that order).

And, of course, the essentials: free food and swag.
