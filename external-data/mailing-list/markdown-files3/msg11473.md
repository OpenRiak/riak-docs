Hi

The tutorial/documentation will be out soon (just as soon as I polish up some 
details).

Counters are initialised to zero, but there is no "initialise" command. 
Instead, you send an increment operation, and internally the counter is 
initialised and the operation is applied to it. If you read a non-existent 
counter, you get not found.

So, to "initialise" to a different value, just send the increment operation to 
get it to the value you want.

NB: I've been referring to it as an "increment operation" but you can send 
negative values to decrement a counter. There is no separate operation to 
decrement.
