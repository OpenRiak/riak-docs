Hi,

I have a cluster of 17 riak (1.2.1) nodes with bitcask as a backend.

Recetly one of the node was down for a while. After the node had been
started the cluster started doing handoffs as expected. But then a merge
process also began on the same node. I know this from the log messages like
this:

2013-04-18 08:14:09.061 [info] <0.22952.79> Merged
["/var/lib/riak/bitcask/496682197061674038608283517368424307461195825152"


And then something went wrong (the logs on the same node):


2013-04-18 08:39:22.217 [error] <0.31842.70> Supervisor riak\_core\_vnode\_sup
had child undefined started with {riak\_core\_vnode,start\_link,undefined} at

The node itself was disappearing from time to time:

# riak-admin ring-status
Node is not running!

The beam process was still running though.

Maybe it's not releated to handoffs & merge. It was just a guess.


Any information and advice on this would be greatly appriciated. It's still
happening right now and I could gather more details if someone wanted me to.

Thanks in advance.
