Hi,

I just upgraded to 1.4 and have updated my client to the Java 1.1.1 client.

According to the release notes, it says all bucket properties are now 
configurable through the PB API.

I tried setting my backend through the Java client, however I get an Exception 
"Backend not supported for PB". Is this property not configurable through the 
API, or do I need a newer version of the Java client than 1.1.1?

Thanks.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
