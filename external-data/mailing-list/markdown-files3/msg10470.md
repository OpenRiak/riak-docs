Hi Mark,

I've updated the Github issue[1], it now includes a reference to a
changeset[2] which does the following:

\* Adds the ability for a node to create connections on the fly rather than
have them pooled up front. This is done on a per-node basis, so technically
you can have some nodes pooling and others not pooling (not sure why you'd
want to do that though!).
\* Adds a sample config to the live tests which uses the on-the-fly
connections.
\* Adds a load test which hits the test cluster using the on-the-fly
connection option.

For a given node, just set the \*poolSize\* value to 0 (zero) in the node's
configuration, this will tell the node to operate in "create connections on
the fly" mode. I'm guessing you'll want to do this for all nodes in your
cluster. This should work with both cluster and proxy configurations.

Feedback appreciated.
OJ
