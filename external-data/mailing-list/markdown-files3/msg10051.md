Looking at the documentation on Basho I think that the arguments for a 
JavaScript Map and Reduce function are pretty well detailed. But one 
detail still eludes me. All of the samples show raw data in the 
database. I was wondering if I put JSON serialized objects into the 
database if I can access the members of the object like:


 v.values[0].data.myField

Where myField is a field of the object that I put in the database as 
JSON. In other words can I assume that the JavaScript will deserialize 
the JSON object?


Thank you.
