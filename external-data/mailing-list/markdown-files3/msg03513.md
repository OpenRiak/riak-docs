Robert,

What Keith said is misleading -- that key cache was solely in the Ruby client 
driver and not part of Riak itself.

In Riak, deletes have two phases; in the first, so-called "tombstones" are 
written to the partitions that own replicas of the key. The tombstone has 
special metadata marking it as such and an empty value, but has a descendant 
vector clock from the last known value. In the second phase, the tombstones are 
read back from the replicas, and iff they all are tombstones (that is, all 
replicas respond, and all are tombstones), a reaping command is sent such that 
they will be cleared from the backend.

In your case, what may have occurred is that the replica chosen for key-listing 
did not receive the tombstone write (only 1/n\_val of all partitions are 
consulted for key-lists), or had not yet received the reaping command. When you 
read the key again, you obviously get a "not found" because the other replicas 
will resolve to a tombstone. Eventually your read requests will invoke 
read-repair, updating the stale partition and causing the value to be reaped.

The moral of the story here is, again, don't rely on key-listings for strong 
indications of cluster state.
