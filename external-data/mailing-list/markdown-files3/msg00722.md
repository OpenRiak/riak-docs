Hello all,

We're trying to sort out a conflict resolution strategy and are
wondering if we can rely on the order of the conflicted values in a
document for it. So for example, for a given document we might end up
with the values:

 [ "Wednesday", "Tuesday", "Thursday" ]

>From doing a little testing, the last value in a multipart document is
the first, so "Thursday" in this case, can we assume that this will
always be the case? And is it a good idea to base conflict resolution
on this?

Regards,
--Misha
