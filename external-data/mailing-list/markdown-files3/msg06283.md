Correct

Users reporting missing documents, same as in January.

I'm pretty sure they didn't (especially for the user that complained),
but can't put my finger on it.

(I don't know how much Search has changed in 1.0.x, but keep in mind
I'm running 0.14.2 in production.)

I'd love to provide you with more information, but don't have much
time to go digging around. The workaround is, well, a workaround, but
it let us move on. I'll keep a special eye on this until it happens
again, and let's definitely keep each other posted.

Thanks,

Francisco
