Hello Ari,

I'm assuming you're talking about Yokozuna (Riak Search 2.0). Answers inline...

Yes. You can POST data to the /yz/extract URL to see how your JSON (or
XML) is parsed by the extractor.

When search returns data it can return values as well, depending on
the Solr schema being used. Ideally you build your schema to index and
store just the data needed by your application.

I'm not sure what you mean here. Generally, child objects can be
stored either as part of their parent (nested) in a value, or as
values in another bucket. In the latter case, the parent object just
has a reference to the child's ID (and vice-versa, if necessary). The
decisions you make when modeling your data should take access, update
and search patterns into account, since all impact the shape of the
objects you store.
