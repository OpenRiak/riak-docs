Thanks, this is all very helpful.

I think what I'll do is keep the Riak settings at default and not do
anything tricky there.

And then I'll use Redis as a locking manager as described here:
 http://redis.io/commands/setnx

Initially it will just be a single Redis instance but by the time I'm ready
for production (quite a long ways off) I'll use either Redis Sentinel for
high availability or use Redis Cluster for high availability +
auto-sharding / horizontal scalability.

That will get me distributed, key level, atomic shared write locking,
allowed on any arbitrary Riak key at the expense of higher latency during
the write operation.
