Excerpts from Sangeetha.PattabiRaman2's message of 2012-08-08 13:33:25 +1000:

That's what I would expect.

This is very odd! Given that your path looks fine & without getting on the
machine it looks as if it's completely and utterly screwed.

My initial thoughts are it's one of the following:

\* /bin or /usr/bin has had files deleted - but I assume the machine
 behaves properly when you are normally logged in so this would be
 unlikely.
\* Some of the shared libraries are missing or corrupt but the above
 caveat applies.

As any user other than riak what happens when you type:

 which sed

it should return /bin/sed (I'm checking this on a debian machine so it
may be different on yours).

You might want to run

 ls /bin
 ls /usr/bin

and see what that returns. It should be a whole load of stuff including
sed, tty, etc

If sed exists (I'll assume it's path is /bin/sed) try running ldd

 ldd /bin/sed

is should return:
 linux-vdso.so.1 => (0x00007fff6f1ff000)
 libselinux.so.1 => /lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1 
(0x00007fcb57137000)
 libc.so.6 => /lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fcb56db0000)
 libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fcb56bab000)
 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fcb57377000)

If any shared libs are missing you'll get (from the top of my head):

 libdl.so.2 => missing

it might not be "missing" but it won't be a path.

You're worried criminals will continue to penetrate into cyberspace, and
I'm worried complexity, poor design and mismanagement will be there to meet
