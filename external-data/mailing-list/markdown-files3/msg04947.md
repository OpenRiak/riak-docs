Kyle,

This is something I have been trying to figure the best approach for as
well. One possibility, and the one I am trying to build a solution for is to
have a proxy in the front that accepts and API key or some other form of
credential, validates, then passes through to Riak on whatever port is
specified. The goal is that in addition to your IP filtering and access
rules, you also have a layer of authorization at what ever level you want
through the proxy.

Hope that helps,
Jeff
