5) OJ Reeves picked up his great series on Riak and Erlang and published
another extensive blog post. Readers of his past posts won't
be disappointed with the fourth installment, and if you're at all
interested in learning more about Riak, Webmachine, and/or ErlyDTL I highly
recommend you check these out.
