We were getting upto ~20 messages per second while nodes were leaving
the cluster. We went from 19 nodes down to 15. Ring size is 64, using
bitcask as the store.

Requests on this cluster were averaging around 10k/sec, spiking to
25k/sec occasionally. Request mix is 99% GET with a few PUT and DEL.
We don't use mr, search or list at all...
