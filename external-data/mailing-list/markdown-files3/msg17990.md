I've been playing with messaging and Raspberry Pis a lot the last couple of
weeks and it seems to work pretty well to use a couple message brokers like
Mosquitto MQTT or something lightweight and publish data to the broker
locally. A bridge configuration can make sure the messages get routed from
the device to a "real" broker somewhere that Riak is also running on in a
more traditional clustered configuration. An ingest script pulls data from
the broker and pushes it into Riak. This configuration is proving to be
extremely flexible because devices can come and go easily and setup and
dealing with Riak clustering is not an issue.
