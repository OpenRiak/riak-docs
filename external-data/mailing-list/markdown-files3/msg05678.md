You need to change the ports as well. If you built using the github source,
it would make you 4 nodes each configured with a separate port, otherwise
you need to manually need to change them on the second node.

The limit warning is separate and will not cause issues if you are playing
around. If you want to get rid of it, there is a tutorial on the Basho wiki
on how to set the limit in OS X.

Hope that helps,
Jeff
