Hi Luke,

I’ve been messing with my Riak cluster since our last communication and when I 
ran your command, I got the following response with siblings:

=====================
Siblings:
5VLG9CV4KsvrqGYeDhs5fK
xwAMA6aDXvOgBoGItBRA0
5IIcpzXLMtn24may8JIyQ9
=====================

(see liono.json attached)

Then I stopped Riak, deleted the data directory and recreated the bucket type, 
index, and re-inserted the liono record using the command you gave me. It 
produces the same indexing error in the log, but now if I run "curl -o 
liono.json -XGET localhost:10018/types/animals/buckets/cats/keys/liono”, I get:

=====================
{"name\_s":"Lion-o","age\_i":30,"leader\_b":true}
=====================

(attached as liono2.json)



liono.json
Description: application/json

liono2.json
Description: application/json


Is there an easy way to see what Riak is sending to Solr when indexing new 
documents?

I’m going to install Riak on a clean Ubuntu machine instead of OS X to rule out 
any environmental issues.

Thank you for your replies!

Regards,
Stan
