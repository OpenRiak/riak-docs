Hi Norman,

It's still the case. Riak KV was designed to be highly available, and
highly scalable key/value store with predictable low latency. This lets
you scale to a few or as many machines as needed, while removing any single
failure points that a single-machine database or cache might impose.

We unfortunately don't have connectors for every language / platform /
framework combination, the explosive exponential swath of support would be
exhausting. We do keep well maintained client libraries
, and
community libraries and plugins are always growing in number. I think
Luke's suggestion would provide a good way forward, and we'd be happy to
help with any questions you have along the way.

Thanks,
Alex
