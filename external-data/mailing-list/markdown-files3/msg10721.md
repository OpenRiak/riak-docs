Hey Elias,

It's referring to the vnode replicas on the node you are replacing. Doing
a force-replace reassigns all that nodes partitions without handing them
off, so the replicas on that node are "lost". However, since riak
replicates to 'N' physical nodes, there should be other replicas of your
data.
It will take a repair to replicate the data to the new node though.

Thanks,
Alex
