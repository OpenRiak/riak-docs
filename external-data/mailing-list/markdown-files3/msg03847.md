I can't figure out how post-hooks are to be setup in Riak. I was wondering if I 
could get an example of where to set it up (is it via the client or is it on 
Riak's server side?). I've read this in the wiki already 
http://wiki.basho.com/Pre--and-Post-Commit-Hooks.html#Post-Commit-Hooks
but it doesn't exactly go into much detail of how/where to set it up.

Thanks in advance
