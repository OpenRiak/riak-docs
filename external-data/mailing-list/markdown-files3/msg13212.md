Hi All,

Is it at all possible to have default bucket props be based on the 
bucket names? I ask because I'm trying to use Riak to store key/value 
data and use the buckets to separate the data based on day and for a 
couple of different projects, for example:


buckets/project-year-month-day/key

The issue becomes I have one project that needs 'allow\_mult' to true, 
and another that needs 'last\_write\_wins' set to true (requiring that 
'allow\_mult' be false). So using the default\_buckets\_props will only get 
me half way there.


Does anyone know of a way I can do this? The only solution I can think 
of off the top of my head is to create a cron job that creates the 
bucket sooner than when the clients start writing to it.


Thank you in advance,

Bryce

PS -- can anyone tell me what:
{multi\_backend\_prefix\_list, [{<<"0b:">>, be\_blocks}]}}
does?
