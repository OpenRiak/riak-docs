Dear Team ,
 I have a 64 GB RAM ,during the Load of 35 million dataset (1.8 
GB) it consumes nearly 40-45 GB of RAM durial the startup of the erlang script 
,but
While trying to load 40 million dataset (2.1 GB) I am getting the following 
error
escript: exception error: no match of right hand side value {error,enomem},

Queries:

1. Is this related with memory issue only or please let me to know ?

2. Is there a provision to make use of the swap memory in riak config?

 total used free shared buffers cached
Mem: 64422 41371 23050 0 404 6398
-/+ buffers/cache: 34568 29853
Swap: 64017 5798 58219

Thanks & regards
sangeetha
