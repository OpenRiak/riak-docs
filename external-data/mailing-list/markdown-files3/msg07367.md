Trade offs. I dislike rewriting stuff that doesn't scale. I love the
idea of just throwing another box into a cluster and having it "just
work" without rebalancing issues, etc. I'm tired of dealing with shards,
complex replication setups, etc.

I will also be using heavily for logging, URL shortening, social share
registering, etc., and I'd rather stick to one datastore.

I agree it's a bit of a round peg in a ovoid hole when it comes to
geospatial + mapreduce queries, but I imagine it won't be long until
geospatial indexes arrive at Riak as well, and then I can switch to
those. :-)


Mecha. Coming soon. Talk to jrecursive.
