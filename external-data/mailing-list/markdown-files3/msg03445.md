Hi Justin,

 Thanks for the reply. Good to know you may have some partial
solutions for the sizings of items. Out use case may long term
require us to write out own backend just for space efficiency, but
I'm hoping we can make it quite far with bitcask. I've got enough on
my plate at the moment so am unlikely to get to this before you guys
do, but as I recently forked riak\_kv for something else, you never
know.

Thanks

-Anthony
