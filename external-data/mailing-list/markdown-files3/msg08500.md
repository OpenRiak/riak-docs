Hey Yousuf,

I'm not sure there's a way to make this cheaper for you. You're going
to have to do a GET and work with the not-founds. The alternative
would be a HEAD request for the key, which would just return the
metadata. This won't save you any time on the request but might cut
down on client-server bandwidth (which may or may not be an issue
depending how many PC hooks you're firing off).

You could use "if\_none\_match" but that's still going to result in a full read.

Hope that helps.

Mark
