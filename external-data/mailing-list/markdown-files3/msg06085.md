Simeon,

I think the assumption is that if it's a precommit hook you "know" that if
an object was written then it has also been indexed. Whereas if it's a
postcommit the object may be written but the indexing fails. I think the
guiding decision would probably be what you favor, 1) that for any object
it's index will exist first, therefore your query results are "consistent"
with your data or 2) that data persistence is the foremost priority and
inconsistent or eventually consistent query results are acceptable (because
maybe objects are constantly updated and eventually they will get indexed).
 The thing to keep in mind is that the precommit will block the write, and
if you're using a persistent backend like bitcask or level you may not want
your data sitting in memory waiting for the indexing to finish. Another
thing to think about is using a postcommit that fires off into a queue that
is indexed thus reducing latency on your clients writes to Riak. My point
is that there are many factors and if you are going to go down the
Riak/Solr route you should take your applications requirements into
consideration.

HTH,
-Ryan
