Hi Magnus,

This cluster has been running in production for a few months. Key
generation is based on flake (https://github.com/boundary/flake); we
have never experienced a collision in the 3+ years we have been using
it heavily in production. However, I will look into that possibility
as well.

I just noticed that one of the Riak nodes logged this at the time:

2017-04-13 17:42:40.567 [error]
<0.3624.28>@riak\_api\_pb\_server:handle\_info:331 Unrecognized message
{30320806,{ok,{r\_object,<<"session">>,<<".12011742tWzDvu8mk5WAdfYihfV\_T3DcnJ5VDyXC0c">>,[{r\_content,{dict,3,16,16,8,80,48,{[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]},{{[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[[<<"X-Riak-VTag">>,53,114,86,115,108,71,120,112,73,55,108,118,114,100,105,114,107,104,50,66,105,119]],[[<<"index">>]],[],[[<<"X-Riak-Last-Modified">>|{1492,105357,453143}]],[],[]}}},<<...
(actual value removed).

I also have another example (from the same cluster) where there is a
\*single\* writer to a key, but after a few writes/updates, it also got
a sibling error. Also at that time, the write+read took significantly
longer than normal. I'll check if we had any "unrecognized messages"
in the Riak logs at that time as well.

To answer your second question, we are talking to the riak cluster
over protocol buffers, using the official Erlang client.
