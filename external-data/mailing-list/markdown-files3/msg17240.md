Hi,

We are using Riak in production, but hit an issue that 80% of keys are
deleted in Riak through Erlang API
http://basho.github.io/riak-erlang-client/riakc\_pb\_socket.html#delete-3,
but we only got 5% disk space saving, we expect 80% disk space saving, can
anyone please help me?


Thanks.

Shifeng
