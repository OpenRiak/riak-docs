Konstantin,

Doing a HTTP Ping request[1] to Riak is one approach. You could also
do a HTTP Fetch[2] for a specific bucket/key pair.

Another thing worth noting is that the all-new v2.0 of the Java client
we'll be releasing for Riak 2.0 is much, much better in terms of load
balancing and node management. It's built from the ground up to work
with a cluster vs. the old client which just sort of had it tacked on.

Operationally, for example, you'll be able to just push a properties
file out that your application can monitor and reconfigure the running
client.

Thanks,
