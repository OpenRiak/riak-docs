Just getting this back on the list in case anyone has time to dig
through these logs.

MVM - any chance you have a moment to take a peek?

Hi Mark,

Yes..it appears I underestimate how quickly my machines would fill
up. I added more volumes but appears too late. I am now affecting
map reduce.

Attached is the logs. Would love to repair but if not..its ok...I
will just rebuild and start new.

Thanks
