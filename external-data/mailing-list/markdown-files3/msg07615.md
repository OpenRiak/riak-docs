Suggest implementing security outside of riak. The interface to applications 
which use riak for storage should not be riak-dependent. In addition, it would 
be wise to avoid exposing storage-level details like bucket choice in the 
security model for your applications.

For more details in why riak should not be exposed to the internet, if that was 
in fact the intention, read this:
