Evening, Morning, Afternoon to All -

Today's Recap is exceptional (especially for all of our riak\_core
fans): tons of new code, blog posts, videos, upcoming presentations,
new production users and more.

Enjoy, and have a great weekend.

Riak Recap for April 13 -14
====================

1) jtuple released two repos yesterday: "riak\_zab" and "riak\_zab\_example"

\* riak\_zab is an extension for riak\_core that provides totally ordered
atomic broadcast capabilities. Check it out here --->
https://github.com/jtuple/riak\_zab
\* riak\_zab\_example is the sister repo to riak\_zab

Thanks, jtuple!

Related to this code, Alex Popescu (@al3xandru) wrote up a blog post
exploring some of the potential implications for riak\_zab + riak
\_core.

2) For anyone who is going (or considering going) to Erlang Factory in
London, there is a preso from Arun Suresh at Yahoo! that you're going
to want to put on your calendar.

\* Details here --->

3) Sean Cribbs released a sample app called "riak\_id". From the GitHub
repo: "riak\_id is a very simple application that serves both to
duplicate functionality from Twitter’s “Snowflake” and to teach, via a
very simple example, how to build a riak\_core application."

\* In other words, go take a look ---> https://github.com/seancribbs/riak\_id

4) Kresten Kreb released some great code that enables you to build
"simple secondary indexes in Riak based on Riak's link mode."

\* On GitHub here ---> https://github.com/krestenkrab/riak\_link\_index

Thanks, Kresten!

5) If anyone sees aphyr (Kyle Kingsbury) in #riak, be sure to
congratulate him on the very successful launch of Riak (and
MySQL)-backed showyou.com.

Congrats, Kyle!

6) Andy Gross contributed a nice chunk of code to Ryan Zezeski's
"rebar\_riak\_core" repo .

\* Details here ---> http://twitter.com/#!/argv0/statuses/58682543221907457

7) @frank06 et al have just added "very rudimentary support for
keys=stream" to riak-js.

\* Details here ---> http://twitter.com/riakjs/statuses/58993765980962816

8) We posted the follow up to the Riak + Operations Webinar that
happened yesterday.

\* Video and slides on the Basho Blog --->

[note: this one is definitely worth your time]

9) Jared Morrow is now member of the Basho Team!

\* Quick blog post about it here on the blog --->
