Hi Basho developer,

I've seen the video that you guys present about rian\_ensemble. I am
interesting to implement riak\_ensemble in the production environment in the
future. After reading the documentation(
https://github.com/basho/riak\_ensemble/tree/develop/doc), I still couldn't
understand how it's work and implement it. Could you tell me in a simple
way to implement it in the single node to simulate multiple nodes or 3 real
nodes?

So far, I can compile riak\_ensemble via rebar and run
application:ensure\_all\_started(riak\_ensemble). But I don't know what should
I do after that(sent K/V, communicate to other nodes, etc)

 Thank you in advance.
