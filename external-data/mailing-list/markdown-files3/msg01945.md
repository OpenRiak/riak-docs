Cool, I mostly notice that at the top-level it seemed to be a slight renaming
but I didn't quite figure out what the inner part did.

Well, yeah, basically ngerakines is the root, current development is on
a couple different forks of that, see

https://github.com/ngerakines/erlang\_protobuffs/network

The leex/yecc work and most recent active development has been happening
on freke's fork, but I've merged his changes and the basho iolist changes
onto my fork, and am working to try to get freke to merge my changes over.

Well, there's not really that much of a community unfortunately, I think
most people have abandoned protobuffs in favor of thrift, but there are
a few of us who use it and are mostly forks of ngerakines at this point.
I only tend to re-evaluate whenever I need to update software, so only
recently notice that there are 2-3 people adding features into
erlang\_protobuffs mostly based on the freke fork, so I merged with
that and then after figuring out I couldn't use riak-erlang-client with
this version of erlang\_protobuffs I set about to correct that (thus my
fork of riak-erlang-client and this discussion). Since freke seems to be
most active, his fork should probably be considered mainline at this point
(although if you want a mostly drop in replacement for your fork you'll want
to try mine with the few changes in my fork of riak-erlang-client).

Please have a look at my fork and at the freke fork, I believe both
use rebar and I actually have my fork setup to be pulled in by my
fork of riak-erlang-client.

So I think it's set up correctly for that. Please let me know if its
not and I can fix it (not too horribly familiar with rebar as I mostly
use framewerk for building erlang).
