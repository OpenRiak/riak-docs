Hey there.

I'm inserting twitter spritzer tweets into a bucket that doesn't have a 
precommit index hook, and a few fields from the tweet into a second bucket 
that does have the precommit hook.


Speeds on the inserts into the indexed bucket are an order or magnitude 
slower than the non-indexed bucket.


I'm using a 1GB ram, 20GB disk vmware VM, 2-node cluster, ubuntu 10.4, 
riaksearch 0.14.0 with n\_val = 2.


Is there a way to do a more lazy indexing to where it doesn't slow down 
inserts so much?


- Steve
