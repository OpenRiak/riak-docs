The \_yz\_\* fields (which need to be part of your schema and defined
exactly as defined in the default schema) are generated as part of
indexing. The entropy data field (\_yz\_ed) uses a base64 of the object
hash so that hashtrees may be rebuilt for the purpose of Active
Anti-Entropy (AAE). My guess is somehow this value if getting truncated
or corrupted along the way.

This code is only executed when rebuilding AAE trees. What is the output
from the following?
