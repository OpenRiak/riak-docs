Riak would be a poor choice as backend for Titan. The graph calculus used in 
gremlin et. Al. requires bounded and ordered set result semantics which riak 
cannot do well or fast or maybe at all.

Thank you Eric and Russell,

I forwarded your replies to Matthias. Unfortunately it doesn't sound too 
encouraging, but I hope you will get around to looking into Titan integration. 

Best regards,
Bernie

To add what Eric said: I don’t know Titan, but the phrase “atomic edge 
operations” suggests they require properties from the datastore that Riak’s 
eventually consistent datatypes can’t satisfy.

All that said, we have been asked by a customer to look at integration with 
Titan, and when time permits, we will.

Cheers

Russell
