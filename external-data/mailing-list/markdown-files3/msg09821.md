Hi Derek,

The best place to start is probably the mapreduce functions officially included 
in Riak 
(https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/blob/master/src/riak\_kv\_mapreduce.erl) if you 
have not already found these. These do however not make use of arguments. If 
you are looking for an example of how arguments can be used, you could look at 
a little library containing map phase functions that I wrote some time back. In 
these I accept JSON documents as arguments and use this to control processing. 
The library is available here: https://github.com/whitenode/riak\_mapreduce\_utils

Best regards,

Christian
