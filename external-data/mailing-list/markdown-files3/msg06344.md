Shuhao and Michael,

I'm sorry I don't know the answer to your question, but please do not be
discouraged! We (Basho engineering) are committed to bring the Python
client up to speed within Q1 of this year, especially to make it have
feature-parity with the official Java and Ruby clients. We are aware of a
number of differences between the official repository and its forks and
will be working to resolve those issues soon. We will also be instituting a
release process that keeps these client libraries in sync.

As is the case with any of our open-source projects, if the feature or
bugfix you need is not there, we encourage you to fork the project and send
a pull-request on Github with your changes. We will review it as soon as we
can. Thank you for your patience!
