This has been addressed a good amount on the mailing list already.

You can read up on it here --->
http://riak.markmail.org/search/?q=delete%20bucket

Short answer is that there is no way to delete a bucket. You'll need to delete
each key. There is a ticket open for it --->

For getting the number of keys in the bucket, check out question
number four here --->

As far as other stats, Riak exposes stats at "http://localhost:8098/stats"

There is also a nifty Ganglia module that Jesse Newland put together a
few weeks ago--->

As an aside, it would appear the wiki is lacking some copy regarding
these questions. I'll set about fixing it :)
