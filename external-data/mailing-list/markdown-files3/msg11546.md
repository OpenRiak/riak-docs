We have two different unlinked riak clusters.
One used for statistic aggregation across the system. This one heavily
abuse riak secondary indexes range query feature, so we have to grow it
with caution.
Another one used as our main storage. Both clusters have different
backends, different nodes count, and occasionally different riak version.
Our library handle this use case.
Also we implemented keep alive pings to each riak node inside each cluster
(one special keep\_alive connection to each node, that periodically call pb
client ping function).
This mechanism allow us handle gracefully downs and ups of riak nodes
 inside one cluster (if a particular node of the cluster stops responding,
the pool is temporarily stops route requests to it).
With this small update external load balancer is no needed anymore.
