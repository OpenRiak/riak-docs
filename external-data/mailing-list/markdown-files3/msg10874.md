Hi Mattias,

When Riak executes a MapReduce job, it will determine a covering set of 
vnodes/partitions that will handle the processing. The vnodes selected will 
vary between runs, and if the partitions do not all hold the same data, there 
may be differences in the results between consecutive runs.

- How many records do you have in the bucket? 

- How large portion of the results typically differs between runs? 

- What does the mapreduce jobs look like?

Best regards,

Christian
