Nice proposal.

It would be great if you could add a 'matches' regular expression option like 
you currently have on key filters. I can't speak for everyone here, but this 
[in addition to the 'limit' option] would definitely be a killer feature for me 
and would definitely make managing large datasets much easier.

Cheers.

Charles.

Reid I really like your proposal. It gives some of the same expressiveness to 
2i that one gets with CouchDB views. Ability to retrieve sorted descending 
would be very cool as well.
