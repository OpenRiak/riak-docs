It's a little bit mixed up here. Sorry, my fault, there is two threads with
similar problems.

So the factory now is \*standard\_analyzer\_factory\*. I changed it, why It
didn't work with integer and whitespase (probably by my lacking of
understanding how it works). That means the values are just literals now.
And it work with this. I'm going to play with integer factory then.

Thanks for your help!
Vladimir
