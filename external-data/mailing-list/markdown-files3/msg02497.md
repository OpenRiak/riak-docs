Correct me if I'm wrong but you write a high-performance app by specifying 
dw=all on every write. I'm thinking something along the lines of "take your 
time inserting the data, just let me know when you're finished". That's 
drastically different from "don't return from this call until you've written to 
every node I might potentially hit with a query".
