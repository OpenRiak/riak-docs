Hey Nick,

I just built Riak from master and didn't have any issues with it. Any other
details about your setup you can share?

Alternatively, you can try using one of the pre-built packages. [1]

If the troubles persists, hop into #riak on freenode if you can and we'll
get you some help in real time. (Even if you solve the problem you should
come by and say hello.)
