I have a bucket which contains images refernced by a key which is made up
from a guid. I have a number of servers in my cluster and my bucket is set
up to store 3 versions of every item in the bucket across the servers in
the cluster. I'd like to understand a little bit more about how my cluster
is performing in terms of data storage. I can find out how much space each
bitcask is currently taking up on each server, but I'd like to compare
reference this against the number of unique keys that are being stored in
the system.

I've tried to use map-reduce methods using the erlang methods defined in
the riak\_kv\_mapreduce, calling them against the HTTP interface but my
queries are timing out. I've tried to extend the timeout, but it's still
timing out.

What's the most efficient way to find out how many keys exist in a
particular bucket?
