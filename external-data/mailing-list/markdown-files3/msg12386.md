That option is for the connection timeout (i.e. when the connection
pool makes a new connection to Riak).

You can set the read timeout on the socket with the aforementioned
withRequestTimeoutMillis()

The default is the Java default, which is to say it'll block on the
socket read until either there's data to read or the remote side
closes the socket. That would at least get the client "unstuck".

This, however, doesn't explain/solve the real issue you're describing
which is that Riak is hanging up and not sending data.

Someone else will need to chime in on that - are you seeing anything
in the Riak logs?
