Roland,

You've happen to hit on one of the sore spots of the riakc client. We very
much plan to rectify this but it seems to have eluded us for 1.0. As you
said I think the best alternative is to use the HTTP interface.

As for your final question. Taking a quick peek at the code it looks like
it the setbucketreq simply ignores properties it doesn't understand.
