Hi, Norman. This error is saying that Wriaki couldn't connect to the
Riak server. You mentioned changing web\_port, but did you change the
'riak' setting? In Wriaki's config, 'web\_port' specifies what port to
expose the Wriaki web interface on, while the 'riak' setting specifies
where to find Riak. Judging by the stats output you pasted, you want:

 {riak, {http, {"127.0.0.1", 8091, "riak}}}

if you want Wriaki to connect to Riak over HTTP.

I've also just pushed some updates to wriaki and
riak-erlang-http-client that I hope to merge to master branches later
today. You may or may not find that they work better with Riak 1.0:
