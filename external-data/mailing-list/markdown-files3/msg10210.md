Thanks Russel, that looks like exactly the problem we saw. I have never built 
riak from source before but I will give it a try it this weekend.

Hi,
Thanks for trying Riak.

It sounds like you are experiencing this bug 
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/334

It is fixed in master, but it doesn't look like it made it into 1.3.0. If 
you're ok with building from source, I tried it and a patch from 
8895d2877576af2441bee755028df1a6cf2174c7 goes cleanly onto 1.3.0.

Cheers

Russell
