What I pasted shouldn't be sending the values of the objects to the
client. It should send just the keys back. I'm not a major user of
the Python client, but it looks like the result is a list of RiakLink
objects, which are just bucket-key-tag holders, not RiakObject
objects, which include values and metadata.
