 I know that this isn't directly a Riak issue but I am sure that some of you 
have met this before and can maybe help me. I am used to Macs and Windows but 
have now set up an Ubuntu 14.04LTS server on my home network. I have 5 fixed IP 
addresses so the server has its own external address. I have opened port 8098 
on my router to point at the server and checked that ufw isn't running. I have 
tested with it running ufw and with 'allow 8098' applied. I still cannot 
connect to Riak. On the same computer I get a pong back to a ping so Riak seems 
to be OK.
I have a Riak server running on AWS and had trouble setting that up until I, 
eventually, opened all ports.
Can anyone please suggest some steps that I might take? I need this running for 
an Open University course that I am studying. My AWS free server runs out 
before the course finishes so I have to get this up and running soon.Thanks in 
advance.David
