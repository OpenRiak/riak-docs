Dear All,
Just a follow up to Martinâ€™s email to say that packages are now available at 
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.9/2.9.0rc2/ and that more will be coming soon.

Please be reminded that this is a release candidate and is probably not 
suitable for use in production. However, please use or abuse it in as many ways 
as possible in your test environments and report any issues on 
https://github.com/basho/riak/issues accordingly.

Best regards,

Nicholas

Subject: [ANN] Riak 2.9.0 - Release Candidate 2 Available

Release Candidate 2 for 2.9.0 is now available on github. It is available to 
build from source here - https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0rc2.

The changes from Release Candidate 1 are described here - 
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/develop-2.9/doc/Release%202.9%20Series%20-%20Overview.md#release-292-rc2.

The changes are mainly in two parts:

- Improvements and fixes to the leveled backend following further 
property-based testing;
- An uplift of mochiweb (the HTTP handler used by Riak), to take in general bug 
fixes, but also to allow for the receive buffer to be configurable to 
workaround an issue with receiving large HTTP headers 
(https://github.com/basho/riak\_api/issues/123).

Thanks to all those who contributed to the release. My current expectation is 
that the release will be finalised before the end of February. Apologies again 
for the delay.

Regards

Martin (@masleeds)
