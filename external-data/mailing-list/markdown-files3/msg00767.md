Hi, Alexander.

My apologies. Given that it was in our bugzilla I let myself use some
Riak-internals jargon without explanation.

In this context, a partition is a logical segment of the ring space,
managed by a vnode process on a given physical host. There is a
1-to-1 mapping between a vnode process and a partition.

The idea is that right now the bitcask backend stores all data in a
given partition together in a single bitcask instance. The
alternative backend under discussion would break that up, such that
within a partition (and thus in each vnode), there would be a bitcask
instance for every bucket that had any data.

Does that help to clarify?
