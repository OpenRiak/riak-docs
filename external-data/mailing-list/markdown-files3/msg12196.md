If I remove all keys from a bucket that bucket is not visible when I do

curl http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets?buckets=true

I know buckets are only prefixes for keys so in theory bucket does not know
if it's empty (or maybe it does) but to me it looks like only buckets with
keys are visible.

Is there any purging mechanism in Riak to remove unused buckets?

Regards
Daniel
