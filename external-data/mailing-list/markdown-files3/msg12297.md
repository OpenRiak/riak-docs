Hello,
I tired to install riak-cs on Debian, but installation fails due to an 
error in the post-install script.


# dpkg -i riak-cs\_1.4.1-1\_amd64.deb
Selecting previously unselected package riak-cs.
(Reading database ... 51331 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking riak-cs (from riak-cs\_1.4.1-1\_amd64.deb) ...
Setting up riak-cs (1.4.1-1) ...
chmod: cannot access `/etc/riak-cs/\*': No such file or directory
dpkg: error processing riak-cs (--install):
 subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Processing triggers for man-db ...
Errors were encountered while processing:
 riak-cs

The VM has no internet connection (has access to the university's Debian 
repo), so I downloaded them from the Basho website. I expected the 
config files for riak-cs in /etc/riak-cs, but the directory is empty.


Is there a newer version of the package or is it a bug?

Regards,
Sebastian
