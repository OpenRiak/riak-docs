Greg,

Wait. Couple serious environmental issues here:

- " results are close enough to LevelDB, Bitcask, â€¦": Bitcask is always 1.5x 
to 2x the performance of LevelDB. Bitcask has a constant throughput until its 
first merge. Your comment states all the databases are close. Bitcask and 
Leveldb are never close in real life. Sounds like your testing was either CPU 
bound or some other environmental bottleneck. This suggests to me that you 
might have achieved a similar throughput with 3x5 notecards too.

- "levels out at 2500 ops â€¦" within 10 minutes per your attached graphs. Stock 
LevelDB from Google does not start to seriously degrade until 90 minutes of 
constant load. Yet the performance graphs offered have tanked within 10 
minutes.

Bad data does not motivate me to spend time with yet another offering in the 
key/value storage space. Comparison of 20 hour runs, maybe. But those 
benchmarks need to validate known performance differences of Bitcask and 
Leveldb to establish credibility. 10 minutes runs have barely flushed memory 
caches.
