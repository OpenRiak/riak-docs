There is a nice BitCask formula for creating suggested nodes for a riak-kv
ring. Is there something similar for riak-cs? What are the rules around how
large the key store needs to be in the multi-tenant data store, as I assume
cs is only storing a reference to the large object value. Are there any
guidelines around cs node sizing?
