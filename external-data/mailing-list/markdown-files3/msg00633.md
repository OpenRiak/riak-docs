Hi Ted,

A few observations about your original message:

The curl command you provided looks correct, however, there are new line
characters after each header (Content-Type, Riak-X-Vclock). I am not sure
whether or not those were added by the email client. The presence of new
line characters in the headers would cause the request to fail. The request
should work without the new line characters:
curl -v -X PUT -d '{"bar":"baz"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H
"X-Riak-Vclock:a85hYGBgzGDKBVIszMk55zKYEhnzWBlKIniO8mUBAA=="
http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true


I am not sure what you mean by converting the command to HTTP headers. The
raw request looks as follows:
PUT /riak/test/doc?returnbody=true HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Riak-Vclock: a85hYGBgzGDKBVIszMk55zKYEhnzWBlKIniO8mUBAA==

{"bar":"baz"}


Regarding your last attempt, option "c", it's important to note that URL
parameters are not included in the body of the request when processed by
Riak. Riak will store the data included in the body of the request and
ignore unrecognized URL parameters.

Thanks,
Dan
