Hello guys,

currently I am reading documentation about LevelDB backend on the site.
Can you explain me one thing, in your example of calculation cache size you
suppose that if we use cluster with 4 physical nodes and with 64 partitions
each node has 16 partitions.

\*For example, take a cluster with 64 partitions running on 4 physical nodes
with 16GB of RAM free on each. In a best case scenario, all the nodes are
running, so a good cache size would be half the available RAM (8GB) divided
by the number of expected active vnodes on each node, which would be 64/4 =
16. That's 536870912 bytes (512MB) per vnode.\*

But if we have N=3 then each node has more than 16 vnodes is not it?

Best,
Mikhail
