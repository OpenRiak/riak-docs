Hi Robert,

When you install the official Riak package for Ubuntu 14 Riak will use
an OTP release bundled with the package
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/downloads/).

Unless you have specific requirements otherwise, installing Riak from
packages is the recommended, supported method.

Thanks -
