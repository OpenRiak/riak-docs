Is there anywhere a pseudo-code or description of the algorithm how
vnodes (primaries and replicas) would be distributed if I had 3, 4 and more
nodes in the cluster?

Does it depend in any way on the node name or any other setting, or is it
only a function of number of physical nodes?

Regards
Daniel
