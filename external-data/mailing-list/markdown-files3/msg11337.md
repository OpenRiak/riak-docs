Riak Users,

One of my fellow coworkers found an issue in the Riak 1.3.2 RPM's. There
is a typo in the init script that causes `service riak status` to fail.
 This will cause those of you who use Chef, Puppet, Ansible some pain
because they expect status to work properly (as they should).

The issue is described in full here:
https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/343

I have built a new set of packages for RHEL 5, 6, and Fedora 17. They
still have the version of 1.3.2, but now with a package revision of '2'.

If you have already installed a 1.3.2 package with RPM or Yum, you can use
the simple patch found here to patch your init script:
https://github.com/basho/riak/commit/c315dc9b68497a61fe18ebca7984b165cee8f32f.patch

The downloads page has been updated with the new packages
http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.3.2/downloads/
For all RPM's, the package version should be "1.3.2-2". If you see "-1"
then try hitting refresh on your browser.

Sorry for the mistake on my part and the hassle this might have caused
anyone.

Thanks,
Jared
