Thanks, Kevin, that's great news. Looking forward to hearing more.

Yea, that was my understanding but indeed, it may have caught me off guard :)

Unfortunately I couldn't reproduce the problem with our sum function.
It works just fine now. What I am totally certain about is that I saw
it failing (logs are the proof) and by simply './riak restart'-ing the
problem went away. Hope not to experience something similar in
production!

Good point, I am \*not\* using named functions so I imagine `riak-admin
js\_reload` does not apply to my case (or does it - I never triggered
it)? Every job I submit is comprised of anonymous functions (except
Riak built-ins, that is) -- I am developing plenty of ad-hoc queries
to be run once in a while on our production data.

The rest of the weirdness could have come from my side (possibly badly
coded reduce functions). Better error reporting, as well as guidelines
and gotchas when building reduces and advanced examples, would
definitely help. What I can say right now is that I'll be closely
following this matter, and come up asap with any issues I may
encounter.
