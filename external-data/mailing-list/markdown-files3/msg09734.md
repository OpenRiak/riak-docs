Yes, absolutely.

There are no atomic compare-and-set operations available from Riak, regardless 
of headers and R/W values.

Conditional HTTP requests are present because they are "free" due to 
Webmachine, and they are sometimes useful, but should not be seen as 
semantically very different from the client doing a read itself to decide 
whether to write.
