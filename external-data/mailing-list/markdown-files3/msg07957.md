Hi,
Friday evening one of our riak node has reach his disk space limit during
indexing in riak-search. Then after adding some nodes, some requests fail,
and it is impossible to find the correlation between requests with error or
those who succeed.
The errors are :
{{nocatch,stream\_timeout},[{riak\_search\_op\_utils,gather\_stream\_results,4}]}
{timeout,range\_loop}

and sometimes (not always) :
{{badmatch,{error,emfile}},[{mi\_segment,iterate\_by\_keyinfo,7},{mi\_server,'-lookup/8-lc$^1/1-1-',4},{mi\_server,'-lookup/8-lc$^1/1-1-',4},{mi\_server,lookup,8}]}

So anyone else has experienced these errors ? Is it possible that they come
from the disk over limit error ? How can I try to repair merge index data ?
If it is not possible, what is the good process to delete entirely all the
indexes (only indexes, keeping riak datas).

Thank you very much.

Regards.
