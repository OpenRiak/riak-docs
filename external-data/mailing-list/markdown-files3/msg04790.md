Now that Riak has secondary indexing, are there any plans to "auto
index" a Keyspace into a Bucket?

Such that walking a Bucket doesn't do a global scan?

Yes, we can do it in the application-space, but it seems like a good
initial application of it, and having it done automatically
server-side has significant advantages over the application doing
secondary passes or pre-post commit updates.

Thanks!
