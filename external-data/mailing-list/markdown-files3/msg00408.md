Hello, Germain.

You've already come across read-repair. Between that and
hinted-handoff a great deal of passive anti-entropy is performed in a
Riak cluster. As long as one doesn't use requests with R=N these
mechanisms are generally sufficient.

We do have plans for a more "active" anti-entropy as well, so that if
you know a given node has lost all of its data you can trigger a much
more efficient and immediate complete repair from the replicas in
other nodes. (without needing external backups) At this point, that
is only a plan and not a developed feature, so if you don't perform
backups then a trawling read-repair is your best bet in the case of a
complete loss of a node.

-Justin
