Hello:

I'm trying to understand how to do a map/reduce referring to meta-data.
Example (I'm using JavaScript).

I have a meta-data field called X-Riak-Meta-start-time; the contents of which 
are a Unix timestamp. 
I'd like to find all keys with a timestamp older than now() - 30 days ago. 
Reading through the documentation this seems to be straight forward if I was 
looking at the actual data being stored, however, I'm simply unclear as to how 
to do while looking at a MetaData field. 

Appreciate any help you can provide.
