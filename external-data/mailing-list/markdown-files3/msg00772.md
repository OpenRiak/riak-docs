Hi,
 Has anybody tried out tokyo cabinet as a backend for riak? I have hit
blockers with existing backends for my usage. Innostore has a key length
limit of 255 chars and bitcask wants to hold all keys in memory. I have been
looking at an alternate which can handle a huge number of keys, tokyo
cabinet seems to be ideal. Though I have not been able to find any
references to usage of tokyo cabinet behind riak.
