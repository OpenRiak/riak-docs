Should be or should not be, it is uncertain. Since every box(physical node) 
claimed for vnodes from the dynamo ring. Each vnode is the data unit for data 
storage. If n=3, then one set of data will be stored by 3 copies. If the 
copies of all data are averagely sparse on each box, then the positive answer, 
otherwise negative.

There maybe some "left" data. I suggest that rm -rf dev1 dev2 dev3; then 
rebuild.
