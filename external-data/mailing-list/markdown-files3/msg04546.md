Yes, keys are only deleted when all the values are tombstones and all
the nodes are up. In theory bringing the other node back up and
re-reading the keys will read-repair the keys on the node that was down
to be tombstones and then hopefully they'll be removed.

However, deletes are flaky on 0.14. Things should be a little better in
1.0.
