Looks like thet the issue is that some time ago I deleted my bitcask and
AAE directory. Before this I had made a strongly consistent bucket and had
some data in it, but upon deleting those dirs, the data from the strongly
consistent bucket dissapeared, however the bucket type info persisted. That
bucket type is now useless I guess, and the looks like the only way to
delete it is to delete all contents of data dir:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27567451/how-to-deactivate-or-delete-a-bucket-type-in-riak.


Thanks for the help,
