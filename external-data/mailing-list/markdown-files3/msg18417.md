Hi all,

I have created a Slack channel. Here is the invitation link[1]
I think it is better to have a quick talk beforehand in Slack to
organize big meeting with a rest of Riak funs/lovers.
We are ready to provide some resources and i believe lots of folks
would like to do the same.
It would be very efficient to organize, as fast as possible.
For anyone missed, there is an alternate mail group[2] if this one
ripped of suddenly.
