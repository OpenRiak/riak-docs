In general, for production you want to use SLC or eMLC drives (which are
quite a bit more expensive than MLC but also have fewer degredation
issues).

Another way you can improve your life significantly I/O wise is to use
an OS with ZFS (such as SmartOS, IllumOS or Solaris) as these can be
configured to use the SSDs as a large cache for reads and write backs to
slower I/O such as SAS or SATA.
