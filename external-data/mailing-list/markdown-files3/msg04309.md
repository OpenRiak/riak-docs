 The main point of memcache is that it is distributed and the clients
 automatically handle failover at any reasonably large scale. How do
 you arrange that with redis?


You can achieve this with Redis with a little bit of client-side magic.
 Antirez suggests this:

I've implemented a similar scheme with Redis, except also added a
replica for every shard. The clients in this case know about all shards
and all replicas and do failover themselves.

I really like Redis, but once Riak gets secondary indicies, I hope to be
able to scrap this big cluster of Redis servers and keep everything in Riak.

Redis is really good for being just one of something. You can use it
for locks, unique ID generation, etc., but you somehow need to address
the failure case.


Everything breaks. I don't want to live with just one of something. 
Just 2 of something would be good enough for most the things that will 
fit on one machine. In some cases I wouldn't mind 2 independent data 
collectors but don't know how well riak would de-dup the data where both 
values are written at the same time as new items with no vector clock 
history.
