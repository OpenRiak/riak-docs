Hi and thank you for the reply. My comment follow:

Your tests are not close to what you are going to have in production


My tests are exactly what we will have in production. 1 node or in best
case 2 nodes.
We don't care about durability here.


If you don't care about durability, why do you want multiple copies of
each object? I.e. why not just keep n=1?

The only reason is that if the HW dies we will have to import the data again
.. which takes like one week.

That's why i would prefer 2 nodes setup



 Our request per second will be extremely

low too(300 per day ?)
Also we use 2i indexes.



Given your parameters, I have to say.. are you sure Riak is the right 
tool for your job?


A classical database, like Postgresql, could be a better fit.
It can import data much faster than Riak for a single client, and 
provides indexes, searching, etc.
And of course you can have streaming replication so that you have a hot 
spare in case of hardware failure.
