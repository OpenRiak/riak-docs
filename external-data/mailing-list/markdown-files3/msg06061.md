Mark,

I agree that parallel requests are sometimes hard to manage. That's why I 
scrapped that branch since it interferes too much with the design of the 
regular client. Instead I want to leave it as an advanced hook in the transport 
layer for those who might need to write something more advanced. 

Pseudo code might look something like:


$pool = new HttpPool();
$http\_requests = array();
foreach( $objects as $object ){
 $http\_requests[ $object->getKey() ] = $pool->add( $transport->prepare\_put( 
$object ) );
}
$pool->finish();

foreach( $http\_requests as $key => $http ){
 $response = $http->reponse->result;
}


I agree, though. I tend to farm operations like this out to a job system.

~ John
