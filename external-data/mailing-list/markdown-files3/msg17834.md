Hi Shaun,
We've been running Riak CS since its early days, so it's possible best
practice has changed.. but I'm sure at some point it was suggested to put a
haproxy between CS and KV to guard against the issues of start-up race
condition, individual KV losses, and brief KV restarts.
I'm sure we used to have continual issues with CS being dead on nodes
before we moved to the haproxy solution. That was probably on Debian
Squeeze though, and these days we're on Ubuntu LTS, and so if CS is
launched from Upstart at least it can retry to start, whereas on old-school
init systems it just gets one attempt and then dies.

Moving on though--

Even if it's not the majority practice, shouldn't CS still be able to
withstand dropping and reconnecting it's protocol buffer TCP connections?

CS still has a problem with not handling the case when its long-standing
idle PBC connections to KV get reset. Regardless of whether that's because
the local KV process is restarted, or because we've failed over to a new
haproxy.
The errors get pushed back to the S3 client software, but even if they
retry, they get repeated errors because, I think, CS has such a large pool
of PBC connections. You have to work through a large portion of this pool
before you finally get to one that's reconnected and is good.

In our case, the pool size is multiplied by the number of CS instances, so
quite a large number.
Most client software has retry limits built in, at much lower values.

While it will come good eventually, there's a significant period of time
where everything fails, all our monitoring goes red, etc. which we'd like
to avoid!

I'm surprised this problem doesn't come up more for other users; I don't
feel like we're running at a large scale.. but maybe we're using a more
dynamic architecture than major users.
