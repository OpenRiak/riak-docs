You really don't want to do that... In the past, when using PostgreSQL and
binding it to a subdomain like db.yourdomain.com (just for not having to
remember IPs, even it doesn't really matter in code-level) I
had experienced randomly and unexpectedly very slow timings and even
disconnections for quite some painful time just because DNS servers between
were having issues, etc... Using an IP address will never incur in this
kind of issue as no hostname translations has to be performed.

I don't see any benefit for doing so. Just use IPs and forget about DNS
related issues.
