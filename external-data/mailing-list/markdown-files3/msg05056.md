If I enabled allow\_multi on a bucket and do I DELETE followed by a PUT
I am getting a 300 response with one sibling having the body of the
PUT and a second sibling with an empty body. If that the expected
behavior?

I wrote a script that would start with a reconciled value. Get the
VClock of the current value. Then do every permutation of a PUT with
(Pv) and without (P) the VClock and a DELETE with (Dv) and without (D)
the vClock and I see the following result:

Pv Dv 404
Dv Pv 300
Pv D 404
D Pv 300

Is it expected that a delete creates a blank sibling like that and
therefore we should treat empty body's as deleted?

Thanks,
Eric Moritz.
