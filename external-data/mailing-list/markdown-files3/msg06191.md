Hello All.
 We currently have a large number of DL 380 HPs with 8 SAS disks in a 
raid 10 for our Riak cluster. One of the ways in which we were considering 
increasing performance is to move the Riak files off to SSD. Has anyone on the 
list moved to SSDs? Have you any statistics on performance gains?

 I've had a look through the mailing list archives and can see no 
mention of it. Which brings me to another point, are the archives searchable 
anywhere? I had to go through month my month topic listings.

Regards,
Dave.
