Riak Recap for March 14 - 15
======================

1) We announced a new Riak Meetup in Leeds! The first installment will
happen on April 18th and will feature Basho Hacker (and Leeds-local)
Russell Brown and Brightbox Developer John Leach (though it's unclear if
he'll be bringing his dog).

2) Something for all our coffee fans out there: @voluntas tweeted a picture
of what looks like a latte with the Basho logo stenciled on top. (This is
awesome, by the way!)
