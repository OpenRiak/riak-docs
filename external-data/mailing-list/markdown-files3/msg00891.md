May be I try to rephrase my question Since bucket are not specifically
declared and as and when it will be created base on put(B,K,V ...), so B can
be anything and it become available. I need to created post commit for some
buckets but not for all and those are not know beforehand. Since it is not
declared and its virtual and so how to create post commits for this
scenario? one way is app.config and I am trying to see what is the best way
to do.
