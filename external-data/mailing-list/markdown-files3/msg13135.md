Ivan,

What makes you think the index is damaged? From what I can see this is a
bug in the code assuming that a #ho\_acc record is always returned but in
fact an error tuple could also be returned. That error tuple could be
caused by index corruption but there is nothing in your email to say for
sure. Do you see any other errors in the log?
