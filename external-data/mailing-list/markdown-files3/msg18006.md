Hi Andrey,
The register inside a map is a LWW-register.

Long story: When we added CRDTs to Riak we did it for those users who wanted to 
avoid writing custom sibling resolution code, following on from that decision 
we decided not to add the MVRegister type. Riak’s default object is an 
MVRegister after all. When I say “we” I mean the CRDT team as was then, not 
Basho, as I am no longer at Basho.

Cheers

Russell
