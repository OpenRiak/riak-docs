Hi Simon,

We use HA proxy for that matter, set up HA proxy to at localhost:8087 
and then your Riak Java client pointing to it, this is a sample HA proxy 
config: https://gist.github.com/gburd/1507077


HTH,

Guido.

Hi Riak users,

we are using the Riak Java client and need to support high availability

Currently I am connection the pbc to a specific node in our cluster,

I would like to pass a list of IP's so that in case the connect fails 
on one we will try the operation again on the other node (Also that 
way the work distribution is shared by all the nodes on the cluster)


Thanks,

Shimon
