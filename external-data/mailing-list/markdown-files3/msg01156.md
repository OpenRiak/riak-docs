Hello,

I'm working on a side project and I don't know much about reasonable
design for a Riak schema.

I'll have a hybrid model, with user profiles sitting in Postgres and
their data in Riak.

If I were to store a blob of info per user per day (3 text blobs, a
date, a URL and tags), does it make sense to have one bucket per user?
If so, the key for the daily blob is simple, the date (unless that is
also silly).

I'm guessing 100 users, with maybe 400 RiakObjects per user per year.

Does that design seem sound, or am I breaking some fundamental rules?

Sorry for naivety,
Tyler
