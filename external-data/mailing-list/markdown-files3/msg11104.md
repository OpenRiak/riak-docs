Hi Abhishek,

I have a few suggestions that may be worthwhile testing in order to get better 
performance from your cluster:

1) Ensure you have followed the guidelines for EC2 instance tuning: 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Performance-Tuning-AWS/
2) The Protocol Buffer interface is considerably faster than the HTTP 
interface, so switch to using the protocol buffer driver 
(basho\_bench\_driver\_riakc\_pb) if possible. You may also try increasing 
concurrency somewhat to see if that has any effect.
3) If your application is write heavy but will not update values (you are 
unlikely to need vector clocks in order to resolve conflicts), you can set 
'last\_write\_wins' to true in the bucket properties. This will generally result 
in better write performance.
4) As I/O performance may vary on EC2 instances, you may want to try enabling 
provisioned IOPS to see if this improves performance.

Best regards,

Christian
