Howdy,

We're holding the first Amsterdam Riak meet-up on Wednesday the 28th
of November!

It's an informal drink-up, which seems like a good way to kick off the
Amsterdam Riak group. Come say hello, meet other Dutch Riak types and
have a beer courtesy of Basho EMEA. Chris and I from the London office
will be there.

We're meeting at Bier Fabriek around 8pm. Let us know if you're coming:

Cheers!
