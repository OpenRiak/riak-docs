Hello Riak Users,

The Basho team recently released Riak 1.0 which introduced a new
feature called Secondary Indexes. This feature allows you to tag Riak
objects with additional metadata, and then later query the indexed
metadata to retrieve the objects.

(See http://wiki.basho.com/Secondary-Indexes.html)

Now that you've had a few weeks to investigate and experiment with
Secondary Indexes, I'm hoping to hear about your experiences to help
us focus future development efforts most effectively:

 - Have you tried Secondary Indexes?
 - Does the feature help solve your problems? If not, why not? Any
 concerns?
 - What is your wish list for the future of Secondary Indexes?

Please feel free to respond either publicly or privately to this
email, and thanks for your help!

Best,
Rusty
