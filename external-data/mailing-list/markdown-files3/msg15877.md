Hello Cezary,

I’d monitor your system's memory as well as the JVM’s memory usage 
(http://visualvm.java.net/ ). Solr’s documentation 
on OutofMemoryErrors is here -> 
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrPerformanceFactors#OutOfMemoryErrors 
. 
Updating search.solr.jvm\_options should alleviate most issues however.
