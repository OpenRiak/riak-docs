Thanks Mark.
Just a quick clarification.

when you say there will be some extra metadata on the object, which one do you 
mean exactly? The object being linked to, or the one holding the link
Secondly, I am actually using riak.js. How does a 404 translate in this case 
when I am doing a link walking and the object has been deleted? Will I have an 
id but not actual object? 
Please clarify
Thanks in advance
José
