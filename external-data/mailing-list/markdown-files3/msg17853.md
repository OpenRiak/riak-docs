Hi,
I have a follow-up question around this security aspect.

If the riak-cs.conf and stanchion.conf files are changed so that their
admin.key and admin.secret match a different user (eg. not that
first-created admin user) then will that user now have admin-like
privileges?

Or are the admin-abilities determined by something set in the admin user's
data in Riak?

Thanks,
Toby
