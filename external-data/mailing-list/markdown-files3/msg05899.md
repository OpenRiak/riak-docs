If someone was to enable m/r jobs in clojure that could be an outstanding 
integration, exactly because clojure represents code as data .. the 
intergration could be so smooth. With JavaScript you have this ugliness of 
putting scripts inside strings that makes it so painful.

Perhaps using clojurescript (clj->js compiler) w/runtime library installed 
inside riak could do it.
