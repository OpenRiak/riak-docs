Hi Eric,

I don't get multiple siblings on a Riak GET for the key.

My buckets currently have allow\_mult: false and last\_write\_wins: true
The n\_val is the default 3

When I search, an example return is as follows, I can see the \_yz\_id has a
unique number on the end alright though?

Thanks for the help!

Jason
