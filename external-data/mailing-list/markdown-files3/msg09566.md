Can you go into more explanation of exactly what you mean by 'Monotonic Read 
Consistency'?

Vectors clocks in Riak are meant to be opaque. It's not impossible to 
use/decode them, but it's not trivial (particularly outside of Erlang).
We've not run into a use-case (afaik) where someone \_needed\_ to decode them.

where is this cache? is it local to each actor? If so, sounds like you've just 
implemented read-your-writes

The last-modified timestamp should be when the write for that version of the 
value was recorded.
