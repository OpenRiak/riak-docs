Hi Weixi,

Can you please confirm what you mean by "extra index"? Do you mean that an
object was indexed more than once and gets counted / returned by Solr
queries? If that's the case, can you please let me know how you query Solr?

Riak/Yokozuna indexes each replica of a Riak object into Solr. With the
default n\_val of 3, there will be 3 copies of any given object indexed in
Solr. Depending on the version of Riak you are using, it's also possible
that siblings of Riak objects get indexed independently. So yes, it is
possible to find several additional objects in Solr for each KV object.
When querying Solr through Riak/Yokozuna, the internal queries are
structured in a way that only one replica is returned. Quering Solr nodes
directly will typically lack these filters and may return more than one
copy of an object.

You can perform a GET/PUT cycle through Riak KV on an object. This will
result in n\_val copies of the objects across the Solr instances, that
replace previous versions. It is not possible to have just 1 copy, unless
the n\_val for the object is exactly 1. AFAIK, there have been some fixes to
Yokozuna in 2.0.7 and the upcoming 2.2 release that deal better with
indexed siblings. Discrepancies between KV objects and their Solr
counterparts should be detected and resolved by active anti-entropy (AAE).
