Thank you. I was not trying to search I was just trying to store the value.

 

When I try to open the file I get

 

The website declined to show this webpage

 

So I am not sure what changes you made.

I ran the sample code you sent over on my local machine and it ran without
error. I did have to enable riak search on an individual bucket by setting
bucket properties, but you can see the changes I made here:
http://clientresources.brentozar.com.s3.amazonaws.com/CITest.zip

 

You may not get the search results that you want from your JSON document
because it doesn't conform to the default Riak Search schema -

Instead of using a binary file I tried a file that contains serialized JSON

From

 

curl -XPUT http://devUBuntu01:8098/riak/buyseasons-orders/1 -H
"Content-type:application/json" --data-binary @test.json

 

So given this error any suggestions as to the meaning?

 

I can put the JSON file on dropbox or someother media if it is needed. 

 

Thank you.

So the question remains in my mind why

 

curl -XPUT http://devUbuntu01:8098/riak/images/1.jpg -H "Content-type:
image/jpeg" --data-binary @test.jpg

 

and the corresponding read

 

curl -v http://devUbuntu01:8098/riak/images/1.jpg >test-read.jpg

 

work without error but the CI call to put fails? How are these different?

Default leveldb config is (when built using `make devrel`): 

 

 %% eLevelDB Config

 {eleveldb, [

 {data\_root, "./data/leveldb"}

 ]},

 

Drop everything but the data\_root. Also: simplify your set up. You're
running into timeout errors in a networked environment. Test your
functionality on a local cluster (either 1 node or a devrel setup with 4
nodes). Validate your logic and functionality there.

 

I wish I could promise that I can help out at all, but I just got back from
12 days out of the country and I'm booked solid for the next two weeks. In
short - my responses will be hit or miss at best.

 

Good luck and godspeed.
