Jason,

It's really hard to tell what's going on without more information about the
environment.

Reviewing the manpage for recv (the C API behind socket.recv), you can see
that the call returns 0 if the connection is closed. Python interprets this
as an empty buffer rather than an error condition.

Now, why would the server-side close the connection? The only thing I can
think of is that there is an unhandled error path in the server code such
that the Erlang process serving the requests exits abnormally, and the
linked server socket shuts down as a result. This is why I asked about the
error logs from your Riak nodes.

So, any additional information you can give would be helpful, especially
what your deployment environment looks like. For example, are you on a
cloud provider or your own hardware? What OS/distribution are you using?
What sorts of other infrastructure is deployed for your app?
