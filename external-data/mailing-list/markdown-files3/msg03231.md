Hi Greg,

You're right, the current situation for handoff is not optimal. We are
aware of these shortcomings and are working on solutions. That said, there
may be some knobs you can turn to minimize the amount of time you spend in
handoff.

Since you are using a ring size of 2048 you are possibly testing the limits
of certain subsystems inside Riak. I'm not saying it shouldn't work, just
that many things in Riak were probably coded with an expectation of a
smaller ring size.

1. For example, riak\_core has a `handoff\_concurrency` setting that
determines how many vnodes can concurrently handoff on a given node. By
default this is set to 4. That's going to take a while with your 2048
vnodes and all :)

2. Also, by default, riak\_core sets the `vnode\_inactivity\_timeout` to 60s.
 That means that the vnode must be inactive for 60s before it will begin
handoff. You could try lowering this to expedite handoff.

3. \_Do not\_ make constant calls to `riak-admin transfers`. Every time you
call this you are resetting the vnode activity and stalling handoff. I
know, I know, how could anyone possibly be expected to know that? Along
with everything else, it's something we plan to address.

In summary, you could try adding the following to your app.config and adjust
accordingly. And keep in mind not to hit `riak-admin transfers` too often
to give the vnodes a chance to handoff.

[
%% Riak Core Config
 {riak\_core, [
 ...
 %% settings to adjust handoff latency/throughput
 {handoff\_concurrency, N},
 {vnode\_inactivity\_timeout, M},
 ....
 ]},
 ...
].

HTH,
-Ryan
