Todd,

Just to humor me can you please paste the result of getting the bucket props
for `my\_bucket`.

Did you enable the search flag for all nodes in the cluster?

Did you restart the nodes after flipping the config?

You can check to see if the index is growing via `du -hs /merge\_index`. If that number is not going up while indexing then
something is definitely wrong.

Another sanity check you could try is indexing a local file in another
bucket like so;

search-cmd index other\_bucket
