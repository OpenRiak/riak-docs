Hello Martin -

 Yes, riak-erlang-client 1.3.1 is the latest tag that you should be
using to build from Github. The protobuffs implementation produces
several warnings during compilation.

I attached the output of 'make' and 'rebar eunit' using Erlang R15B01
to the gist [1] referenced below. I haven't tried R15B02, however
there is an open issue reported [2] when building Riak against it. I
would recommend sticking with R15B01 for now if possible.

Cheers -
Dave
