Given the amount of data Ken has inserted, I'd say there's a 90% chance this
problem is related to a bug I fixed earlier this week:

http://bitbucket.org/basho/bitcask/changeset/6a74d3aac4fb

But without more information, it's hard to say. I presume, Ken, you are also
seeing a vnode crash error before this happens and I'm betting it's emfile
related.
