I agree with the suggestion of gathering a bulk of analytics and then
flushing to Riak, especially as each record is so small, which seems the
overhead per record vs size of actual record seems excessive. I'd consider
grouping your analytics into daily blobs, if not hourly. Writing directly
to Riak in such a way would risk data inconsistencies, or loss, or
conflicts, but if you cached and then flushed at once with data accumulated
into your pre-defined groupings (hour, day, whatever), that would reduce
the number of Riak writes, reduce the raw # records, and you could even
accumulate some interesting summary data per record grouping.

We're working on an analytics application currently, primarily based on
analyzing activity from external systems, and we're taking a similar
approach (gathering data into grouped records, summarizing where desired,
storing into Riak). Our app is still incomplete though, so this is more of
a suggestion than the result of production-level experience.
