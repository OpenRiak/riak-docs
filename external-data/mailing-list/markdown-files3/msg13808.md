Hi Mikhail,

Yes, this is a possible single point of failure, but Stanchion is only needed 
for the creation of buckets and user accounts. Object access is unaffected if 
Stanchion isnâ€™t running.
If stanchion did die, the system would run at partial feature availability 
until you get it running again. If the node irrecoverably died, you could just 
point all the RiakCS instances to a new stanchion node.

One of Riak 2.0â€™s features is strong consistency, so we plan on using that in 
the future instead of stanchion. For Riak 1.4.8 (current version), stanchion is 
required. 

Thanks,
Alex
