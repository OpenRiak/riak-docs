It sounds like you understood perfectly.

Basically we are running a cluster of machines that are busy doing
lots of stuff. We wanted to use Riak to keep configuration
information about those machines and the stuff they were doing. So
Riak would be running on machines whose primary job is something else.
 A critical use case for us is to figure out what needs to be done on
which other machines after one of the machines goes down. Therefore
having the potential to have our data unavailable during a failover
because of the failover kills the benefit that we wanted from a high
availability system.

We've chosen to go with the simple approach of a relational database
on external hardware in a high availability setup. We didn't want
that dependency, but we've done enough now that we're committed to it.
