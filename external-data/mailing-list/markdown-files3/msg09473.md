I worked on different ways of making the new ulimit stick, and by far the best 
way I found is to create the file "/etc/default/riak" with the ulimit -n 
command in it:

ulimit -n 100000

This file gets sourced by the riak init script at startup, ensuring that the 
shell from which riak gets started has the appropriate ulimits set.
