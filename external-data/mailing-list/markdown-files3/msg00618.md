RIak Recap 6/16 - 6/17

1) seancribbs and danoyoung had a brief exchange in #riak about
whether there was an equivalent of "drop table" in Riak.

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/443707

2) Q --- How about using riak as a distributed filesystem? i need data
streaming and bandwidth throttling, so i'll have to implement it.
(from streaming via #riak)

 A --- Several Riak-backed filesystems have appeared, the most
mature of which is probably @crucially's Riakfuse --->
http://github.com/crucially/riakfuse

Without knowing anything exact about the usecase, this might be the
best place to start.

3) theriffer and drev1 had a quick conversation about the advantages
using the PB Client and how links are used in Riak.

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/443766

4) duffomelia and seabcribbs talked a bit about the approach for
building a test database for Riak.

Details here ---> http://gist.github.com/443780

5) seancribbs and allen had a lengthy and worthwhile conversation
about benchmarking and basho\_bench

Gist ---> http://gist.github.com/443796

6) @acts\_as has been hustling on his Riak PB Client and pushed out
version 0.1.5 yesterday
