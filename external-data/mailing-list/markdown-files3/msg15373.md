Hello.

Do you have any update about this issue? I am affected by the same memory leak. 
Sadly, this problem does the Riak memory backend useless in production.

You can reproduce it with this dirty script (be careful, it is resource 
intensive):

https://gist.github.com/indpnday/76d99c5852e0100c5a04

- 1 Riak node 2.0.1. 
- riak.conf:

buckets.default.n\_val = 1
buckets.default.last\_write\_wins = true
buckets.default.r = 1
buckets.default.w = 1
multi\_backend.memory.storage\_backend = memory
multi\_backend.memory.memory\_backend.ttl = 90s
multi\_backend.memory.memory\_backend.max\_memory\_per\_vnode = 250MB


# curl http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/memory/props
{"props":{"allow\_mult":false,"backend”:"memory","basic\_quorum":false,"big\_vclock":50,"chash\_keyfun":{"mod":"riak\_core\_util","fun":"chash\_std\_keyfun"},"dvv\_enabled":false,"dw":"quorum","last\_write\_wins":true,"linkfun":{"mod":"riak\_kv\_wm\_link\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\_linkfun"},"n\_val":1,"name”:"memory","notfound\_ok":true,"old\_vclock":86400,"postcommit":[],"pr":0,"precommit":[],"pw":0,"r":1,"rw":"quorum","small\_vclock":50,"w":1,"young\_vclock":20}}


Is there any bug report opened in github where to follow this issue?

Best regards,
Juan Luis Francés
