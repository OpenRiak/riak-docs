1) Nicolas FouchÃ© made it known on Twitter that Riak (and MongoDB) are
part of the new app he and his team just launched.

\* Details here ---> http://twitter.com/nicolas\_/statuses/42700352667140096

2) While we are on the topic of production users... Jason Williams and
DigiTar were kind enough to put together a few words for the Riak Wiki
about why they are running Riak.

Thanks, Jason!

3) Gerred Dillon (@justicefries) submitted a talk for Red Dirt Ruby
Conf. He's planning to talk about drop-in messaging systems for Rails
built on top of Riak and SQL. If you're planning to attend, vote for
this talk if you haven't already.
