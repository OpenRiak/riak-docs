Agree with a lot of your points, Elias. But I've found that as a solo developer 
pushing product in my organization, and I would venture to say there are others 
like mine, Riak's ops proposition trumps some of these developer issues. Not 
having to hire ops personnel to babysit a Riak app is a big win for 
organizations that barely have money to hire a dev. 

If you are a developer that pushes product you can deal with round trip issues, 
multi fetch issues, etc. Aka. Riak's lack of developer sugar. You mentioned it 
earlier, but a search > MR is exactly how I've done multi fetch in Riak 1.x 
and, it seems, will continue to do in Riak 2.x. Of course, solutions are 
specific to your application. A search > user land multi fetch wrapper function 
is trivial to implement. Actually, I don't know why Basho doesn't ship just 
such a wrapper in erlang that would take an array of bucket/key pairs and push 
out an array of responses. But either way, it's not really a show stopper.

Ya sugar is nice but, as you know, eventually you crash.
