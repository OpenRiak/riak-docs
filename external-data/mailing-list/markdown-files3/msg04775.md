Hi Jens,

Sorry, didn't see your question on the blog. Answers below.

1. Will indexes automatically be updated when documents are deleted? Is it

Yes, indexes for an object are automatically deleted when the document is
deleted.
No, there is no need to specify 'x-riak-index-\*' headers when deleting
documents.

Indexes for an object will reflect the specified index headers for the
latest update of that object. Conceptually, on each update, the old index
entries are deleted, and the new ones are created.

Best,
Rusty
