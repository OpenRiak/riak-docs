Thanks! I did check out both of those, but as far as I could tell neither one 
supported conflict resolution, or at least it's not documented. If it is 
supported, do you think you could give an example of how to do it with sumo? I 
tried passing in the :vector-clock with in the map you pass into put, but that 
didn't yield any results.

My use case right now is that I'm writing a little proxy server in clojure to 
interact with riak. The client will be getting (possibly multiple) values out 
of riak, and passing in the one that it wants to be correct (possibly changing 
that correct one in some way was well before sending it back).
