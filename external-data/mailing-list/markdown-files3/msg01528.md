Correct. This might be highly unlikely though.

As I mentioned in my next paragraph (not very clearly I must confess)
the handoff would eventually start, if not for the node watcher problem
I also mentioned in my first post. Scott Lystig Fritchie created a bug
report for this (https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=878). But this
problem only exists for nodes that are to be removed.
Other nodes might also need to handoff data, if some of their partitions
should be moved to another node. This happens also if you add a node.

The handoffs will eventually start, but it will take longer then normal.
At the start of the node and at every ring update a random vnode for a
parition not owned by the node is started, which might be empty, and
performs a handoff, which consequently might not have to do anything.
When the handoff finishes another random vnode is started (could be the
same vnode though).

Effectively all partitions in the ring are eventually tested, one after
another, and transferred if necessary. But how long it will take to
transfer all partitions is somewhat unpredictable because of the random
part. Also, only one at a time will be transferred, which might take
longer than usual.

If the node is not restarted, all vnodes are still running, so the
number would be correct. Most likely no handoffs were being done
anymore, because four of them crashed and the locks are not cleared in
this case. By default only four handoffs are allowed at the same time.
Have you looked in for the error messages I mentioned in your logs?

You wrote riak-admin status said the nodes were down, thats what I
meant. It means at least that the Erlang VM was unresponsive.

Yes. By using e.g. 'df' or listing the directories in your bitcask dir,
which should be empty if everything went well.
But with the two bugs that are still present it might never finish.
The workaround for this is quite involved at the moment.
I will try to create bug reports in the next few days.
