The comments in the ycombinator.com link are correct about leveldb stalling 
during writes. That is an unacceptable trait for Riak. We have a custom 
branch available to everyone at github.com: "basho/leveldb". The branch 
contains all code changes through 1.9 of Google's code. It also contains our 
tunings to increase leveldb's performance / throughput into terabyte scenarios. 
 The stalls are now mitigated via progressive write throttling if leveldb gets 
too far behind in its background work. The throttling rate is self tuning to 
the environment and work load. We have tested on SATA, SSD, and FusionIO 
semiconductor arrays. All work great.
