Hi,
Search doesn't seem to work on a normal JSON file. Have created index on JSON 
file and installed the search on the bucket also.
$search-cmd search out2\_buk "employee\_name:\"Ajit\""
:: Searching for 'employee\_name:"Ajit"' / '' in out2\_buk...
------------------------------
:: Found 0 results.

File content is pasted below :
"employee":{
 "employee\_name":"Raghav Maitra",
 "employee\_id":"1001",
 "designation":"Technical Analyst",
 "emp\_contract\_no":"1987-XXVI",
 "department":
 {"dept\_name":"ADW",
 "sub\_dept\_name":"A1",
 "dept\_id":"A1-2001",
 "dept\_description":"Analysis and Devlopement Wing",
 "dept\_site\_name":"Diego Gracia"
 }
 "employee\_name":"Ajit",
 "employee\_id":"1002",
 "designation":"Technical Analyst",
 "emp\_contract\_no":"2001-XXVI",
 "department":
 {"dept\_name":"ADW",
 "sub\_dept\_name":"A1",
 "dept\_id":"A1-2001",
 "dept\_description":"Analysis and Devlopement Wing",
 "dept\_site\_name":"Diego Gracia"

 }
