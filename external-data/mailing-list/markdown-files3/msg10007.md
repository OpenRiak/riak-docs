Thanks, Jared.
That worked.

The first time I installed Riak I followed the Fast Track on a Kubuntu 12.04 
box, hit the Github problem and never found the page you mentioned, so
continued with a single node from a Kubuntu binary.

Peter,

There is not a rpm made for 32bit Centos. But if you follow the "Installation 
on Closed Networks" section here: 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/installation/Installing-Riak-from-Source/
 you will not need access to github to build riak from source.

Hope that helps.

-Jared

Hello,

Is there an rpm of Riak 1.2.1 available anywhere for CentOS 6.3 32 bit?

Whislt I am quite happy installing from sources (and have successfully 
installed Erlang that way) I can't do that with Riak as I haven't yet found a 
way to get Git working through our extremely restrictive firewall.

Thanks,
