As was discussed on list earlier in the week, we have been working to make
a Riak AMI available on marketplace and are pleased to let you know that it
is now available...

You can read about it on the Basho Blog[1] and, for convenience, a direct
link to the image page[2] is below.

In addition, our own esteemed Mark Phillips, has a swag pack ready for
testers who can report back with succesfully provisioned, deployed, and
configured clusters using the AMI.
