I want to move my Riak bitcask directory onto a different filesystem
partition in order to make use of more space that is available.

Is it as simple as:

1. Stopping Riak
2. Moving the directory to the new partition
3. Sym-linking the directory to the old location
4. Starting Riak

Is there a better way to do this, and is there anything that I should be
looking out for when doing this?
