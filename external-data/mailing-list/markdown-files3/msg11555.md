I would say no. Riak is generally oblivious as to the content of your data. Any 
ranges or other method you would use to query needs to be explicitly indexed 
via riak search or secondary indexes. Once you have found your data you could 
operate over that data in a map reduce, but I can't speak to "binary safe" blob 
operations in either erlang or JavaScript although I'm inclined to say yes, you 
would be able to operate over it in m/r. 

So searching for keys with certain data in the binblob is probably not gonna 
happen but once you have a key to feed an m/r you could get a slice of that 
value. 

Make sense?
