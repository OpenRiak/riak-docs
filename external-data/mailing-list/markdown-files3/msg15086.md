Hi,

Can you provide your riak.conf file? It looks as though SSL is
partially configured.

Before your next start attempt, please run the following:

rm -rf /var/lib/riak/ring/\*
rm -rf /var/lib/riak/generated.configs/\*
rm -rf /var/lib/riak/cluster\_meta/\*
rm -f /etc/riak/\*.config

With regard to the ulimit warning, please be sure to read our
documentation on Linux installation and tuning:
