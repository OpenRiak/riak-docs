I second the motion!


BTW, as a side discussion, it may be possible to emulate that functionality
with map/reduce, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as powerful/versatile as
if the functionality were directly built into Riak... Not sure if emulation
via map/reduce would even be worth the effort to consider.
