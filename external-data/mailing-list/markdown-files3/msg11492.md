The output I gave you was from riak console. Here it is again:
 riak console
config is OK

Failed to create thread: Resource temporarily unavailable (11)

After rebooting it seems like no more errors with "offline node". Yet a
problem with resources :( I don't know, is it really problem with threading?
Could NPTL 2.12 be a problem? I'm really taking a long shot right now, as
the last couple of days have been nightmare because of those riak problems.
