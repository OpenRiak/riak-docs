Kathleen,

This is a tricky question. On a new database, the cache\_size will help 
performance. As your database grows, the file cache (max\_open\_files) becomes 
more important than the cache\_size because a miss in the file cache is much 
more expensive (disk activity) than a miss in the block cache (cache\_size).

My thought at this time is to leave you cache\_size as is (50Mbytes), and reduce 
your max\_open\_files from 150 to 138.


Once your database is in production, go find a LOG file in the leveldb data 
directory every two weeks or so. Look for a line like this:

2013/11/06-16:32:06.853818 7f972437a700 compacted to: files[ 0 0 29 51 50 0 0 ]

Add the seven numbers between the '[' and ']'. When those total larger than 
138, it will be time to start rethinking the setting. 

Matthew
