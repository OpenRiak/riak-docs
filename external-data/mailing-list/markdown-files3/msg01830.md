Is there a scenario that you know of in which a REST API client would not be 
able to update an object that already exists using the same key but different 
content? I'm seeing this in some testing I'm doing and I don't know exactly 
why. If I delete the object and re-PUT, everything's kosher. But if I try and 
simply update an object that already exists (using plain java.net HTTP client), 
I get a 200/204 back but the object is not updated. I've verified I'm sending 
the right headers and body content I'm expecting to send.

It's almost like Riak is simply ignoring subsequent updates to an object and 
only responds to PUTs of a previously non-existent one.

Any help here would be greatly appreciated. :)
