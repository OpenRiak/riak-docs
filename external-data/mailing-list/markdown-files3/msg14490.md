Hi Leonid,

Which Riak version are you running?

Have you committed\* the cluster plan after issuing the cluster force-remove
 commands?

What is the output of $ riak-admin transfer-limit, ran from one of your
riak nodes?


\*Do not run this command yet if you have not done it already.
Please run a riak-admin cluster plan and attach its output here.


Thanks,
Ciprian
