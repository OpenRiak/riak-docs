Ah - thanks - I hadn't realised that I could pass :type to the robject delete 
method.

I'm finding the ruby client (latest sources cloned from Github) to be quite 
reliable - I have an app which is using most if not all the features, although 
not under any kind of load (I'm actually interested in Riak for its flexibility 
rather than for its resilience, which I realise may be a bit perverse). So far, 
I'm really liking 2.0 :-)

Thanks,

Paul
