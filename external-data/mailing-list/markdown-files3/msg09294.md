Hi there,

I noticed this post from a bit over a year ago (
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2011-June/004592.html),
and wondered whether this was still the case. I've noticed one detail
suggesting that it may be (the fact that Ripple creates a client per
thread), and one that contradicts (the existence of HTTP and PB connection
pools on the client).

Can anyone shed some insight?

Scott
