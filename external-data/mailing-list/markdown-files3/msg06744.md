As a follow-up, the node that was leaving is now stopped. The logging looks 
kind of normal to me, but I notice that all handoffs went only to a single 
other node. I have dumped the logging here:

http://pastebin.com/u6HYNjSZ

My cluster has nodes 1-6, node6 was already converted to 1.1 with LevelDB 
backend, I was trying to leave the cluster on node4. From the logging it 
appears all hand-offs went to node5? Is that normal?

Now I am unsure how to proceed, as all the nodes still give the same error when 
running "riak-admin ringready":

RPC to 'riak@node3' failed: {'EXIT',
 {{badrecord,chstate},
 [{riak\_core\_ring,owner\_node,1},
 {riak\_kv\_status,
 '-get\_rings/0-lc$^0/1-0-',1},
 {riak\_kv\_status,
 '-get\_rings/0-lc$^0/1-0-',1},
 {riak\_kv\_status,get\_rings,0},
 {riak\_kv\_status,ringready,0},
 {riak\_kv\_console,ringready,1},
 {rpc,
 '-handle\_call\_call/6-fun-0-',
 5}]}}

Also I have noted that some "run forever" processes (Ruby) still have a 
Protobuff connection to Riak that appears to work, however new connections fail.

Any advice on how to repair the ring/cluster would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Timo
