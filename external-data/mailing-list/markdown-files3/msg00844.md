Riak Recap for 8/4 - 8/5

1) Basho hacker Dave Smith (@dizzyco) announced yesterday that Bitcask
now requires ~40% less overhead for key storage. This is a huge deal
and should be good news for anyone who was pondering whether or not
the memory requirements of bitcask were too high for their Riak
application.

Also, on a non-riak related note, Dave just announced some other
awesome news!! --->

2) @jebui continues to post great information about what they are
doing with Riak at inagist.com. This one is called "Link-Map-Reduce in
Riak an example from inagist.com" Read it.

3) @soini posted this great tweet --->

Tell you what, Jon: I'll donate some nickels in exchange for you
sharing some details with the list on what your Riak cluster is up to.
What do you say?

4) Sean Cribbs delivered another great Webinar yesterday. This one was
called "Riak with Rails." If you missed it, we forgive you, but don't
let it happen again! Here is what you missed::

6) @argv0 and I were on FLOSS Weekly to talk about Riak. The show was
recorded on Wednesday and it looks like made it onto the net this
morning.

7) Q --- Our database grew up to 23 gigabytes but then dropped to 11
in several minutes. We run bitcask storage. Was it some kind of
repairing? (from demmonoid via #riak)

 A --- Yes, disk space will only be reclaimed periodically when
using bitcask, at "merge" times. As it is append-only, deletes
and old values that have been overwritten don't leave disk until then.

8) drev1 and pjstadig had a great convo in #riak about the if-matches
header in the REST API and whether or not they could be used to
atomically update a value in Riak.

9) Q --- How would one upgrade a much older version of riak (0.8
running DTS/filesystem backend) to TIP with bitcask. Should I just
wipe and go or is there a way to transverse backends? (from
frostbytten via #riak)

 A --- The short answer is upgrade the 0.8, add new nodes to the
cluster configured to use bitcask, and force a leave on the DTS nodes.
You could also do a backup and restore. This method would be slower,
but perhaps less tedious.

10) Oh, and I almost forgot, we now have a Riak Page on Facebook. Go
check it out!
