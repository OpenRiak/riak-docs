A related question -- does the secondary index implementation make some attempt 
to cluster "nearby" integer keys for range queries? In other words, if I have 
an integer secondary index on a set of keys, is this taken into account in the 
partition function?

Since you have to query the full covering set anyway to get all the results, 
I'm not sure how much of an advantage this would be and the complexity 
tradeoff. I'm just wondering if reducing the covering set size based on 
secondary index would be useful for some.
