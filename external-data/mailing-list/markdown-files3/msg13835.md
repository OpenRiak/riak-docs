James,

In general, I think this is a reasonable approach (for some reasonable
value of "real time").
A couple of questions.

Do you mean to use a standalone Solr instance, or the Yokozuna project
(Solr integrated with Riak, in Riak 2.0)? (You can read about its usage
here: http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0pre11/dev/using/search/ )? I'm
assuming you mean the latter, but just wanted to double-check.

The approach of using Solr only for the indexing and querying (especially
taking advantage of Solr's pagination abilities), and storing the data in
Riak (and fetching via multiget) is a good one.
The speed of the multiget will depend on what programming language (and
which Riak client) you'll be using, but again, should be doable.
Your best bet is to run some tests, and see if the speed is acceptable to
your use case.
