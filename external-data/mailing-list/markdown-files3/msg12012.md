With n=3 wouldn't you just need to avoid having more than 2 (of 5) nodes in the
same zone? With 5 nodes you shouldn't have to worry about replicas being on the
same node, so if you only have 2 nodes in 1 zone you wouldn't lose data if you
lost a zone.

The only place I see there being a problem is in regions with only 2 zones or
when you need to expand beyond the 2/zone number. Then you just have to do
backups and accept that you will suffer an outage if you lose a zone.

The cure for all this is having riak get so called "rack awareness" so you can
configure it to make sure that data is replicated across multiple zones. This
is supposed to be coming at some point [1].
