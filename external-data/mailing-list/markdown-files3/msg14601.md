Great news - \*RICON\* is back – bigger and better than ever! As a Riak user,
we want to give you some information about this year’s event, which will
take place October 28-29, 2014 at the Palms in Las Vegas.

RICON 2014 will feature a training day on October 27, as well as two days
of keynote presentations, in-depth sessions, technical tracks, panel
discussions, cocktail events and more.

The call for papers is now open and interested speakers are welcome to
submit abstracts detailing experiences applying distributed systems and
networks, data center innovations, deployment strategies, and real world
experiences until August 18 at 11:59 pm PT. Selected speakers are entitled
to two nights at the Palms hotel and up to a $300 stipend for travel.

Early bird tickets are on sale until September 22, so be sure to get yours
before they sell out!
