Antonio,

The reason the lowercase search doesn't work is because the default analyzer
(whitespace analyzer) is case sensitive [1]. You could use the "standard"
analyzer which will lowercase all terms but beware it's based off the
standard Lucene analyzer which is really meant for full text search.
 Another option, if you are comfortable with Erlang, is to augment the
whitespace analyzer to normalize all terms and add that module to your code
path. Otherwise, your best bet is to probably normalize in
your application.

Looking at your data it seems like you may be using Search as a secondary
index method. You should know that in 1.0 Riak now has native secondary
index support which may fit your problem better.
