Hi List,
I'm experimenting with riak 1.3.1 and I've started a cluster with two
nodes, connected from a dev node and wrote & read a few test keys and
everything was looking good. I was in the process of writing a few
functions we'll need in our system, one of which needs to cycle through all
the keys at startup, stream\_list\_keys looked like it would do the job but
I've just noticed this strange behavior:

(a...@dev1.bfast.com)41>
(a...@dev1.bfast.com)41> DB:stream\_list\_keys(<<"test">>).
{ok,2583625}
(a...@dev1.bfast.com)42> DB:stream\_list\_keys(<<"test">>).
{ok,98542259}
(a...@dev1.bfast.com)43> DB:stream\_list\_keys(<<"test">>).

{ok,66267591}
(a...@dev1.bfast.com)46> DB:stream\_list\_keys(<<"test">>).

(a...@dev1.bfast.com)49> DB:stream\_list\_keys(<<"test">>).
{ok,48399864}
(a...@dev1.bfast.com)50> flush().

Shell got {48399864,{<5272.17736.0>,#Ref<5272.0.0.96767>},{keys,[]}}
ok

The key <<1>> was written over an hour ago and these successive calls to
stream\_list\_keys are ~2 seconds apart, The key isn't always in the first
keys message returned and there's only ever one message returned per call.
>From the comments in the source I expected all the keys to be returned
followed by the done message.
Am I misunderstanding or misusing anything here? Any pointers welcomed.
Thanks,
//TTom.
