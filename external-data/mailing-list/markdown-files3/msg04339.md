Regarding the creation of a 'buildbot' user that shouldn't be the case, so
I'll create a task to look into it. Sorry that the package was
misconfigured for your environment! To be sure I check the correct thing,
you were trying to use the
BASHOriak-0.14.2-1-Solaris10-i386.pkg.gz
package
correct?

I'm glad you got it all sorted out with Dan's help.

Thanks,
-Jared
