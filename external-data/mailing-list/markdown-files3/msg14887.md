Just a clarification on terminology here:
\* Changing n\_val (number of copies of data to be retained) in a running
environment can cause odd behavior
\* Changing ring size (number of partitions containing data) is possible but
challenging

Changing neither would be best, but in this case Dmitri's referring to
n\_val, not ring size.
