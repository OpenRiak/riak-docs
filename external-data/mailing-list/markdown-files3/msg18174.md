Hi,

We are experiencing a weird issue with wildcard search.

Given a field 'email\_register' of type text\_general, containing value
'ste...@streethawk.com',

the query 'email\_register: "steve\*"' should match it,

but it does not seem to be working as expected.

the query 'steven\*' will match successfully.

Any ideas whats going on here?


Regards

Steven
