Keep in mind that the /search endpoint returns consolidated results (i.e. a
query runs over all nodes of a cluster), while /internal\_solr is only for
the node you run it on.

I'm not sure what you mean by "extra stress", as running queries is exactly
what the /search endpoint is meant for. Having said that, I would think
that any activity can add stress, you should measure what kind of stress
your system creates, and plan your cluster accordingly.

Vitaly
