Hi all experts,

I want to use Riak for caching and have few questions:

1) How faster is using memory back-end over bitcask back-end (on SSD)?
2) If throughput satisfying, is there any reason to use more than two nodes?
3) When my memory reaches preset limit (lets say 4Gb) what is going to
happen
 on inserting the next element?
 a) Random element will be dropped.
 b) Oldest element will be dropped.
 c) Next element insert will fail.

Thanks,
 Pavel
