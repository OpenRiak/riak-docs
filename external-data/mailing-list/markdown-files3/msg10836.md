Thanks Evan. I tried doing it in python like this (realizing that the previous 
way I did it uses MapReduce) and I had better results. It finished in 3.5 
minutes, but nowhere close to the 15 seconds from the straight http query:

import riak
from pprint import pprint

bucket\_name = "mybucket"

client = riak.RiakClient(port=8087,transport\_class=riak.RiakPbcTransport)
bucket = client.bucket(bucket\_name)
results = bucket.get\_index('status\_bin', 'PERSISTED')

print len(results)
