good day everyone.. i am new to riak.. while i am doing some testing, i 
encountered a problem when retrieving data using riaksearch.. i am not 
sure if im doing it the right way.. i am using php (from 
https://github.com/basho/riak-php-client) to test..


sample data:

array(
 "fname"=>"test",
 "lname"=>"yadda",
 "contact"=>array(
 "phone1"=>"9999999",
 "phone2"=>"8888888"
 )
)


i was able to retrieve data using

$client->search("bucket","fname:test")->run()
$client->search("bucket","lname:yadda")->run()

but the problem is that i cant get phone1 and/or phone2 values.. i tried

$client->search("bucket","contact.phone1:9999999")->run()
$client->search("bucket","contact->phone1:9999999")->run()

but to no avail.. suggestions/recommendations would be highly appreciated..

thank you in advance..
