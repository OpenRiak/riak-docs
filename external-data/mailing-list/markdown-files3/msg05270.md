Hi All,

I'm relatively new to Riak and just loving it. :)

I have a query about Riak that, why is there no user auth mechanisms? Is it
the part of the design or a future candidate?
Or else, how can I make a Riak based app protect files from unauthorized
access.
I searched the mailing list history, but didn't get a good answer.
Some pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Anoop
