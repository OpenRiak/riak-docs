You have to think at the cluster level. If you have 10 GB of data and if your 
replication factor is three then your total data across the cluster will be 

10 GB x 3 replicas = 30 GB across the cluster

Now, if you have four physical machines in your cluster each will be 
responsible for 1/4 that data. 

0.25 x 30 GB = 7.5 GB

That is because the vnodes are evenly divided amongst physical machines in the 
cluster.
