You are correct. I misread your original sentence.

Yes, but consider that in the last case you can't perform any
maintenance on the cluster until that machine is fully restored
(without making a subset of your data unavailable).

I think that each form of replication brings different advantages to the table:

- RAID lets you survive disk failures without crashing the file system
- RAID also allows you to recover quicker in the event of a disk failure
- Riak replicas give you the ability to survive machine failures and
remain available during network partitions

A lot depends on the type of availability you want to give up when
failures occur.
