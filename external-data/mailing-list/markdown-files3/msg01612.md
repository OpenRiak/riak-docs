You are correct, the innostore backend is not using the parameters passed to
it by multi\_backend:
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=890

Rather than modifying the innostore.app file you can configure the default
innostore settings in your Riak app.config file:
[
{riak\_core, [...riak\_core settings...]},
{riak\_kv, [...riak\_kv settings...]},
{innostore, [{buffer\_pool\_size, 8589934592}, ...other settings...]}
]

Thanks,
