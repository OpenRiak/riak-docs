Well, I worked around my last issue and I'm looking at risk again, in order to 
use the disambiguating logic I want I need to do a pre commit validation that 
involves the new state that is being committed and the old state that is 
currently stored. I believe couch gives you both of these in pre commit but it 
seemed from the docs that risk only hand you the candidate state? Is there an 
efficient way to access the existing state from inside the pre commit hook?
