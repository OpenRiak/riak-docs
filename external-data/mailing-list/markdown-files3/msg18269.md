Are you using leveldb? Matthew (Basho) talk “Optimizing LevelDB for 
Performance and Scale” available in the link below provides a great overview

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo88IdglU\_8&t=1437s

The talk dates from 2013 and some things have changed but I found it very 
helpful

Have you gone through http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/using/performance/

Besides that you’d need to provide more details on your setup

Subject: Riak overall performance falls down

Hi
I have a clustered riak node, when I'm using basho bench to take a benchmark, 
performance falls down, (in spite of for example, 1K or 10K insert rate) after 
some time, overall insert rate is not smooth at all.
OS status after performance reduction: High memory usage, high user I/O wait
is there any one to explain why riak behaving like this?
thanks in advance
