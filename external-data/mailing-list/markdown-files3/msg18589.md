Release Candidate 2 for 2.9.0 is now available on github. It is available
to build from source here - https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0rc2
.

The changes from Release Candidate 1 are described here -
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/develop-2.9/doc/Release%202.9%20Series%20-%20Overview.md#release-292-rc2
.

The changes are mainly in two parts:

- Improvements and fixes to the leveled backend following further
property-based testing;
- An uplift of mochiweb (the HTTP handler used by Riak), to take in general
bug fixes, but also to allow for the receive buffer to be configurable to
workaround an issue with receiving large HTTP headers (
https://github.com/basho/riak\_api/issues/123).

Thanks to all those who contributed to the release. My current
expectation is that the release will be finalised before the end of
February. Apologies again for the delay.

Regards

Martin (@masleeds)
