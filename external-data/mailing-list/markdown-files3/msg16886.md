Hi Jason,

Actually I was moving nodes, one by one. I guess I was missing
the riak-admin replace command. Is there an easy way of restoring Solr
indexes on disk on a node? The data is fine after the recovery but the
index data got deleted in the yz folder. Any advice how to restore it when
a cluster is running and the data is there?

If the fastest way to recover is the reload the entire dataset that is fine
too.

Thank you in advance,
Istvan
