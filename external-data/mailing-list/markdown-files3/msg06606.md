Nicolas, GÃ¶ran -

Great stuff! I'm happy to report that all your hard work has earned you a
much-coveted spot on the Riak Wiki [1] :) Feel free to add/remove anything
to the wiki as you see fit, and keep us up-to-date on the code. Looks like
people wil get a lot of use out it. Also, don't be scared to send along
details on how you're using/planning to use it in production (assuming you
are).

Mark
