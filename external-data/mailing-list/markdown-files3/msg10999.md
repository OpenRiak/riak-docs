OpenLDAP Lightning Memory-Mapped Database seems to be getting traction for
it's high performance and similar query (iteration) functionality with
leveldb:
http://symas.com/mdb/

There seems to be an experimental backend for Riak:

https://github.com/alepharchives/emdb

Does anybody know of it's usefulness? Is there any benchmarks on it?

I've heard that leveldb suffers write performance issues:

Any chances of Basho guys supporting lmdb as an leveldb alternative to
Riak? It would be awesome! :D
