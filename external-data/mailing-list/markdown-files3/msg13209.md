The real Riak developers have arrived on-line for the day. They are telling me 
that all of your problems are likely due to the extended upgrade times, and yes 
there is a known issue with handoff between 1.3 and 1.4. They also say 
everything should calm down after all nodes are upgraded.

I will review your system settings now and see if there is something that might 
make the other machines upgrade quicker. So three more questions:

- what is the average size of your keys

- what is the average size of your value (data stored)

- in regular use, are your keys accessed randomly across their entire range, or 
do they contain a date component which clusters older, less used keys
