If you're using software/hardware mirror then you're already doing it wrong... 
;) Unless RIAK has changed the rules they recommended raid 0 (because by 
definition RIAK is already redundant).

Regardless of the hardware technology used, I fully believe that there will 
never be a 100% foolproof solution to a random cosmic event. Maybe when we're 
using quantum computers the rules might be a little different. 

I suspect that the basho crew can better answer how the hash is validate to 
determine if a node (or it's subsequent elements).
