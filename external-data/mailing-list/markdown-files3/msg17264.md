Hi,
Riak DT[1] is in need of some love. I know that some of you on this list 
(Sargun, are you here? Heinz?) have expressed opinions on the work that needs 
doing. Here is my short list, I would love to hear opinions on priority, and 
any additions to this list:

1. merger smaller map branch
2. deltas
3. new data types (we have a range register and some and Multi-Value-Register 
to add, any more?)
4. Internal state as records or maps (but not these messy tuples)
5. update to rebar3
6. update to latest erlang

Iâ€™m pretty sure there is plenty more. Would greatly appreciate your feedback.

Many thanks

Russell
