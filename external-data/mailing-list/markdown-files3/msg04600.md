Are there any early release notes available as well, regarding specific new
features (high profile or not) that we should pay special attention to, or
possible compatibility issues with upgrading from 0.14.x to 1.0 PR, or
compatibility issues with any map/reduce functionality, or compatibility
with existing clients?

I'm not saying that there are or should be issues, but it seems like a
fairly major version jump, so I want to make sure there aren't any "wow, you
should've realized X had changed" types of issues :-)

Also, any plans for getting the 1.0 final release into package manager
repos? (i.e. - apt-get for Debian, for instance)
