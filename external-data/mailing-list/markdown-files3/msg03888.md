Fyodor,

This is correct. If you want to restore the index you must first install
the Search precommit hook, install the extractor, and then perform the
restore. This is because currently backup/restore is only aware of the raw
data, not the index. As part of our continuing work on integrating Search
with Riak proper I'll be looking at making backup/restore Search aware.
