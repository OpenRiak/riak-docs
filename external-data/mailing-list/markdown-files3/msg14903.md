That's because it's only been released for about 2 weeks. Give it some time :)

Riak also replicates data to maintain high availability. By default, this 
replication value
(n\_val) is 3. So if you have 250M values, you'll end up with 750M documents by 
default,
or 150M per node if you stick with 6. If you reduce the n\_val, you'll reduce 
both the
object count, as well as reduce availability.

If you only create one index, yes.. There's one node per Riak node. You can, 
however,
run more than one Riak node per physical server, thus increasing the solr core 
count.

We've tested up to 10M per node, so you may require more nodes. But it's worth
running a small test to be sure.

Riak will fetch whatever you've configured the schema/query to fetch. If you're
simply trying to get a full object, you may be better off performing the search 
query,
and then using the resulting document's key value (\_yz\_kv) to get the full
object from Riak KV.

You may be deploying the first Yokozuna deployment of that size. I'm interested
in your results. If this is a fixed set of documents, you may get away with a 
lower
n\_val such as 2. Furthermore, you can try increasing the node count.
