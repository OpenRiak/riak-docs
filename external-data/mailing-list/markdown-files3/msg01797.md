Spring Data support for Riak is now available! :) Version 1.0.0.M1 was released 
today and is now available in the Maven repositories for testing in your own 
applications.

Thank you to the Basho folks who patiently answered my questions and offered 
lots of support in making this happen.

Don't be shy about reporting bugs or offering suggestions for improvement. :)

Thanks!
