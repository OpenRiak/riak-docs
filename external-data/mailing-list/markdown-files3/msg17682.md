Hiya Alexander,

Thanks much indeed for the detailed note... very interesting insights...

As you deduced, I actually omitted some pieces from my email for the sake
of simplicity. I'm actually leveraging a transient / stateless chat server
(ejabberd) wherein messages get delivered on live sessions / streams
without the client having to do look-ups. So the storage in Riak is
actually a post-facto delivery / archival rather than prior to the client
receiving them. Hence determining the time key for the look-up isn't going
to be an issue unless I run some analytics where I query all keys (which
would be an issue as I now understand from your comments).

There is of course the question of offline messages whose delivery would
depend on look-ups, but ejabberd there uses the username (the offline
storage is with the secondary index as well on leveldb) and hence the
timestamp not being important. Riak TS sure looks promising there but I'll
check further whether the change would be justified for only offline
messages, or in case other use cases crop up...

Makes sense on the listing all keys in a bucket being expensive though -
let me see how I can model my data for that!!!

Thanks again for your inputs... very informative...

Cheers.
Vikram
