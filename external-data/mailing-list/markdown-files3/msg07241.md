Thanks for the praise of my book. I'm curious though, what does "advanced" 
entail for you guys? I'm continuously working on updates for the book, and I'm 
happy to look at things that you think are missing, but it'd be great to have 
some more concrete examples of what you think a book on advanced Riak usage 
should cover.

Thanks!

Cheers, Mathias
