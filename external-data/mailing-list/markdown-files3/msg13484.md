It is a coverage query, so it hits 1 / N of the vnodes in your cluster. It then 
folds over the whole key space for the given bucket. Riak has back pressure for 
2i queries, but it is reasonably expensive operation. I recommend you try it on 
a test cluster, using basho\_bench maybe, to set up a representative work load 
for your application and see if the impact is tolerable to for your application.

There is not. It would basically be traversing the entire key set.
