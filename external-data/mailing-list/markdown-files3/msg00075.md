Webmachine has been public for some time.

It has its own mailing list and repo:

http://www.basho.com/developers.html#Webmachine

http://lists.therestfulway.com/mailman/listinfo/webmachine\_lists.therestfulway.com

http://hg.basho.com/webmachine

http://webmachine.basho.com/docs.html

I hope that those references help you to find what you need. If you
have more questions, please feel free to ask them. You might get even
more useful answers from the people on the Webmachine mailing list.

Cheers,

-Justin
