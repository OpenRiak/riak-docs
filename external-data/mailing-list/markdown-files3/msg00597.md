Hey all,

I took a few minutes and threw together a page on the Riak Wiki with
some pointers to a few pieces of sample data.

Check it out here ---> http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Sample+Data

Admittedly, it's still quite sparse but we are planning on expanding
it. Definitely send along any pointers or actual data if you have some
that might be good for testing.

Hope this helps.
