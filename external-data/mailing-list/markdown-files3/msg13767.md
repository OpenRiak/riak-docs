Hi Edgar,

please note that I’ve run into the same problem. And I did what you’re 
describing: restarting the nodes one by one and removing the AAE folders. 
However I am strongly suspecting that this didn’t solve it completely for me 
since a few nodes kept thrashing the disk continuously. My gut feeling says 
this is because the AAE starts immediately when the node is started and some of 
the other nodes then still have the incorrect/faulty AAE data, immediately 
triggering repairs or something.

So I stopped AAE on all nodes (with riak attach), removed the AAE folders on 
all the nodes. And then restarted them one-by-one, so they all started with a 
clean AAE state. Then about a day later the cluster was finally in a normal 
state.

Regards,
Timo

p.s. of course I can be wrong and maybe the I/O was caused by something else.
