Hello,

We are running load tests and Riak is sometimes responding with 204 No
content when we do a PUT operation, even though we've passed returnbody=true
and the body we put is not empty (this answer

implies this is not expected)

It happens rarely, so what might be the possible reasons?

Our riak has 9 nodes, w=4, n\_val=5, r=2.



Best,

Bozhidar
