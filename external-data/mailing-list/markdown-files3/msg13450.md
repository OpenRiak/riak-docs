Thanks again for the quick reply.

As you said, I am wondering about apples and oranges primarily. The same
EBS volume backed setup on Linux beat the OmniOS setup my more than 2x.
That is more weird to me than normal. This I tested with simple RAID0 (40Gb
\* 5 EBS devices) on both the operating systems.

Also, I had followed the LevelDB tuning docs and set 50% of 8GB ram for
LevelDB, and rest was supposed to be for os. But the ZFS ARC cache seems to
have a mind of its own. This is unlike how LInux efficiently manages a disk
cache automatically. Again quoting your words, ZFS do needs ram, but I find
a lack of proper documentation on the ARC cache atleast so that I could
tune it specifically for AWS.

Finally, I would want my RAID setup to reduce the latency rather than to be
fault tolerant, since I hope Riak will be available. Also if RAIDZ is going
to have trade-offs of its own, I would not want that to add up to the
unreliability of standard EBS volumes. As summarized, I would repeat my
tests focusing on maybe PIOPS because price is also a concern.

Ultimately, I just wish to avoid any common pitfalls or dead-ends.

Regards,
Hari John Kuriakose.
