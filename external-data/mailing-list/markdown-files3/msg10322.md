Awesome stuff Shane!
Thanks for sharing.

We were thinking about the same approach so that will save us some work.
Also we were planning to add some code to get/put some fixed value into
Riak to check if that succeeds, but I'm not sure if that would work
considering
Riak's HA. I suspect that even if put will succeed key listing still may
fail if not all nodes went up.

BTW. we've noticed that after initial test setup code fails always on
getBucket() with the stack as I posted before.
That's quite surprising I must say.

Regards
Daniel
