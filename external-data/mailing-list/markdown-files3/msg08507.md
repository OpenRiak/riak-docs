Simply copying the riak/data and riak/etc directories should do the trick. You 
can use tar, rsync or simply cp as you feel like, and you can do all that while 
Riak is running at full throttle. The beauty of log structured storage 
(Bitcask, LevelDB, HainoiDB)

At least that's the idea. I seem to remember that there was an issue with 
LevelDB that made basho recommend that you stop a node before doing backup, I 
dunno if that was fixed.

If its just for debugging/dev purposes you can just stop sending requests to 
riak while doing the backup and you should definitively be fine.
