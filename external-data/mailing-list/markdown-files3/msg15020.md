Hi Mike,

You are trying to resolve a domain name 'test-bucket.10.x.x.x,' which is
invalid. This is the part that is incorrect. There are a couple options:

0) You should be able to access the bucket by using
http://ip/bucket-name, like:

http://10.x.x.x/test-bucket/my\_key\_path

1) For easier public access, you can then set up a resolvable domain
name in your DNS configuration for the bucket, i.e. add a dns entry
like:

test-bucket..com

pointing to the riak-cs proxy ip. As long as your proxy is set up
properly, you should then be able to access the object using:

http://test-bucket..com/my\_key\_path
