To clear up this confusion, let me spell it out. The hash value of any 
bucket/key pair is the SHA1 of the serialized tuple of {Bucket, Key}. That is, 
{Bucket, Key} -> term\_to\_binary -> sha1.

The actual function that does the hashing:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/blob/master/src/chash.erl#L140

The helper function that most riak\_core applications use:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/blob/master/src/riak\_core\_util.erl#L160

An example of usage in the Get FSM:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/blob/master/src/riak\_kv\_get\_fsm.erl#L70
