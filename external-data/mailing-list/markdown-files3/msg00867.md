Richard,

If you see this error again, could you please do a lsof on the erlang
process prior to restarting it? Obviously, the erlang VM ran out of file
handles, but it's impossible to tell why without some information from the
running process. We have fixed a bug re: file handles leaks in recent
releases of bitcask -- please make sure you're running 0.12.1.

Hope that helps,

D.
