Ok, I have a half working hack. It isn't pretty 'cos the Jinterface API is 
verbose. I've hacked the pbc.MapReduceBuilder to encode the job as 
"application/x-erlang-binary" and submit that, but really this code should be 
in a separate class, maybe using the output from MapReduceBuilder.getJSON() as 
input. That way you can get the feature without patching the client.

What I haven't done is decode the response from Riak yet. If you want a 
pointer here is a gist of the (unclean) hack. It could use a lot of work, but 
it proves the concept:

https://gist.github.com/1008293

The gist is just the diff so you can apply it as a patch to 
src/main/java/com/basho/riak/pbc/mapreduce/MapReduceBuilder.java if you want to 
play with it. 

You'll have to add Jinterface to your pom too.

 

org.erlang.otp
jinterface
1.5.4


I think it is best to put the result decoding outside the library too. I'm 
going to hack up a poc for that now, but I thought I'd post what I have thus 
far.

Cheers

Russell
