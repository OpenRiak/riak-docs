Hey Ruby+Riak users,

I've just pushed to ripple:master an initial implementation of inter-Document 
associations via links, and I'm looking for feedback. The implementation is 
much simpler than I expected it to be, but I'm aware there are a number of 
special cases and expected behavior that I haven't covered (failing specs would 
be appreciated). 

Here's what does work:

\* Singular (One) associations, e.g. one :avatar
\* Multiple (Many) associations:, e.g. many :tasks
\* Assignment of associated documents that have keys or have been saved already
\* Loading of associated documents via link-walking

Known problems/missing features:

\* Associated documents aren't saved automatically when assigned
\* No validation that the assignment isn't given garbage (i.e. wrong type)
\* No verification of the number of extant links in a "one" association 
(although new ones will get a single link)
\* You can create linked associations on EmbeddedDocument classes. (don't do 
that!)
\* No :through/:via associations
\* Spec coverage is pretty low (2 examples).

I invite you to clone/update to the latest, try it out and give me feedback. 
While this is gelling, I'll be adding by-key associations (easy) and by-bucket 
associations (tricky).
