Setting up my Rails app to run it's tests has been up to this point a
matter of having a config/ripple.yml file like the following:

development:
 port: 8091
 host: localhost
test:
 port: 8098
 host: localhost


Then making sure Riak is running with:
`$RIAK\_HOME/rel/riak/bin/riak start`


I'm wondering how I can go about using the test\_server. I've adjusted
the files in my project like so:

https://gist.github.com/722412

I copied from the Ripple test suite.


When I run the suite though, I'm getting "execution expired" messages.

Do I need to have another instance of Riak running on port 9000?
Perhaps I could adjust the rel to use 9000 rather than 8098.

Any idea what I might be missing?

Thanks!
