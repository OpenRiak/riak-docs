It's probably not a big enough use case to justify another piece of
architecture, also the distributed nature and availability of Riak is why
it's great for this data and the rest of the app functionality. I'm gonna
try implementing a lightweight transaction with ruby procs to wrap the key
rotation. As long as we cover the failure scenarios between the secondary
index and KV, with at least a rollback and reference log for mishaps it
should be all good, plus doing the local updates and verification before we
discard anything permanently. Thanks again.
