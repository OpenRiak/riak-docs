Hi everyone,

I'm trying to use AWS SDK as a S3 client for Riack CS to upload large
objects that I usually don't know the its size, for that propose I'm trying
to use the multipart upload like in the SDK example
https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/doc-src/guide/node-examples.md#amazon-s3-uploading-an-arbitrarily-sized-stream-upload
.
The problem is that I'm always getting Access Denied.

I've been trying some other clients but also without success.

Best regards,
Patrick Marques
