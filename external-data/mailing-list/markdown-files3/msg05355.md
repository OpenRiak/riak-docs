As Kelly mentioned earlier, I am very sorry for the problems you have
experienced. We could have handled the communication of this issue
better. We have been actively investigating it to determine the root
cause. The fix we provided to our customers was a hot-patch and not
fully validated. However, given the concern and severity of the
issue, the patch is available here:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2596651/riak\_kv\_bitcask\_backend.beam

(This .beam simply makes drop\_data\_cleanup/3 synchronous -- this bug
was also present in 1.0.0, though obscured by other behaviour)

Moving forward, we are still working out the best way to communicate
these issues. You may have noticed that todayâ€™s recap included a list
of important bugs; this is only the first step. We are considering a
mailing list for high-severity issues and RSS feeds for
https://issues.basho.com/ to make it easier to learn of new issues.

Again, we could have done better here and will strive to do so in future.

D.
