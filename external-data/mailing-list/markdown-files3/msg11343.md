Riak Users,

We are pleased to announce the availability of Riak 1.4.0 Release Candidate
1. As with other major releases we provide these RC builds so you can test
out new functionality and give us feedback before the final build ships.

The download can be found on the docs page:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.4.0rc1/downloads/

One note about the downloads, the Debian builds didn't get explicitly named
(now that we added wheezy), but that will be fixed by final release.
 Wheezy folks will want the URL with the 'debian/7' path.


The release notes are still a work in progress, but many gems can already
be found, please take a moment to scan through them.

https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.4/RELEASE-NOTES.md


Also, please take the time to scroll to the bottom to read the Known Issues
section as it has an important note about upgrades and initial leveldb
startup time.


Thanks as always for using our software and being such a great community.
-Team Basho
