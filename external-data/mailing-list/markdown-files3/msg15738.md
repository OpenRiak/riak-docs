Hi 
On 3 node cluster Ubuntu 12.04, nodes 8GB RAM all nodes show 6GB taken
beam.smp, 2GB by our process.
beam started swapping and currently is using 23GB of swap space.
vm.swappiness is set to 1
We are using ring 128. /var/lib/riak is 37GB in size 11GB of which is used
by anti-entropy

Is there a way to find out why there is so much memory required by Riak
process?
Thanks
Daniel
