I have a bucket type with custom index (schema). When I search, riak is
retuning correct results but there is no stored fields in the result.

I had another bucket type with custom search index, it's returning all
stored solr fields. But I forgot how I added this bucket type.

Do I need to add something to "props" to be able to retrieve all stored
fields with search results?


thanks,
