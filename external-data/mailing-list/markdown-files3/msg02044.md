Just thought I'm chime is as I also just recently wrote a client pool, which
works in a very different way from these two.

The problem that I see with both solutions presented, is that in order
to get a client you have to route through a gen\_server call, so you are
bottlenecking yourself if you ever have very high traffic.

My solution uses a simple one for one supervisor to manage the
riakc\_socket\_pb gen\_servers and a pg2 for the pooling. pg2 is
actually a distributed process pool, but has a very nice call
called get\_closest\_pid/1 which will return a random pid from your
pool (and prefer to the local pids [ie, those on the local node]),
but without the overhead of a gen\_server call.

Instead it uses ETS to manage the pids which are part of a pool,
then just queries ETS (which can happen in the process itself).
If randomly selecting members of the pool isn't what you want, you
can check out this article

http://lethain.com/entry/2009/sep/12/load-balancing-across-erlang-process-groups/

for a strategy which uses message queue length to determine where to
route a message. The fact is that each process already has a built
in queue in its mailbox, so assuming you are provisioning the right
number of processes, there's no need to queue elsewhere, and using
this to route to the least loaded connection should work and be doable
in each process without the bottle neck of a single gen\_server queue.

I stuck the code here https://gist.github.com/790556 although I edited
it down and did some renaming so it might not compile if you want to
play with it. But basic usage is

1> pool\_sup:start\_link ([]).
2> Pid = pool\_manager:get\_connection().
3> riakc\_socket\_pb:get(Pid,....).

Let me know if there's any comments or questions about it.
