Colin,

Sorry we missed this question. 

Innostore stores its data in a B-tree which expands and contracts according to 
the keys you have stored. So yes, when you delete keys, it should reduce the 
amount of used space. But innostore also pads the tree to keep it balanced and 
capable of adding new keys into the middle, so there will be some wasted space 
and small numbers of deletions won't greatly affect the used storage.
