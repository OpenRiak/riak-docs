Excited for an overhaul. Something brought up in discussions with other PHP
devs, is the need to separate each class into it's own file.
Also, separating out the actual transport logic would be a good move.

And yes, 5.3+ minimum would be a good step forward. Anyone on 5.2 could just
stick with the current client if they're intent on 5.2. No need to ignore
5.3 features or bloat the client due to supporting 5.2 \*and\* 5.3.
