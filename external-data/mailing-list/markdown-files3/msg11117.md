I think the following line is your problem. As others have said, you
should not be M/R'ing over an entire bucket the performance will only
degrade as you store more items in Riak. You should feed an M/R with
results from a search, index or list of bucket/key pairs.


This is something I'm a little confused about as well. I've observed as 
well that big MR jobs on Riak don't perform well. Yet I thought the idea 
of MR was that the workload is split up between the nodes, enabling 
performance to scale as the cluster grows.
