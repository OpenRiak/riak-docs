Dear All,

As Bet365 has been kind enough to make the Riak KV repl repository available 
for the Open Source community, would it be possible to request the Riak CS 
equivalent i.e the multibag repository 
(https://github.com/basho/riak\_cs\_multibag.git) to be made Open Source as well, 
please?

That would finally give the Open Source community access to the key differences 
between the Enterprise Edition and Open Source Edition of both Riak KV and Riak 
CS.

Best regards,

Nicholas
