Hi Brady,

The 2I indices are written in the same store as the main objects whenever
the main object is updated. If a primary node is down, the indices will be
written to a fallback node. When the fallback sees the primary come back
online and stops receiving requests for that partition it will send the
main object back to the primary and that will re-index it.

The docs could benefit with a little clarification. Secondary indices do
benefit from read repair, that is if the main object is spotted as being
out of date or missing during a get, it is rewritten with the up to date
information on all nodes. The anti-entropy mechanism that we are currently
missing is spotting corruption within leveldb itself. For example if part
of a the leveldb database storing a vnode is corrupted so that the .sst
files containing the index entries were destroyed there is no mechanism to
spot and repair that. We are intending to add that for the next major
release.
