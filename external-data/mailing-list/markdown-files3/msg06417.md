Sebastian,

With all requests, Riak will attempt to read or write to all replicas 
regardless of the specified r or w value. The r and w values affect how many 
reads from or writes to partitions must be completed before the operation is 
considered successful.

As a result, the get (read) and put (write) handlers outlive the client 
request. They will continue to wait for either all vnodes (replicas/partitions) 
to respond or for the 60 timeout to elapse. As such, network traffic after a 
large number of reads with r=1 shouldn't be surprising, the request handlers 
are continuing to await responses from vnodes who are working through their 
request queues.

On modest hardware, I've seen Riak clusters perform multiples of 500 ops per 
second. I'm curious, what are you using to perform your benchmark? Does it 
perform requests in parallel? Are requests being made to all nodes in the 
cluster or just one? To find your maximum throughput, you should experiment 
with various ratios of parallel request per node.

Hope that helps.
