Hey Patrick, 
You could try jumbo frames and it will buy you some extra CPU. We have done 
this in a couple of configurations and didn't notice anything crazy. Are you 
thinking increasing MTU might benefit in some other way, other than CPU. I'd be 
interested in knowing your thoughts/results if you test. 

What kind of switches are you using? 

Also, I have never tried Super Jumbo. 


Thanks, 


Sean
