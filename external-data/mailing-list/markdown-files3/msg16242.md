My riak node (i was doing some tests with Riak 2.0.0-1 in Ubuntu having
just 1 node) and after some time, out of a sudden started crashing and even
if i start it again, it hold running only a few seconds before crashing
again.

Then I deleted the AEE folders within "anti\_entropy" and "yz\_anti\_entropy"
and is working fine again... I would like to know the reason for that : )

Thanks,
Alex
