Hi All,

This one has probably been answered many times before and I apologize
in advance...

I have built and installed my first riak instance and along the way
discovered two things:

1. Build with Erlang version <= R14B01
2. This one is a bit different ....

Execution Environment
====================
OS = Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
ERL = Erlang R14B01 (erts-5.8.2) [source] [smp:4:4] [rq:4]
[async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]
Riak = riak-0.14.0

The Problem
===========
I cant execute raik-admin commands because

~/build/riak-0.14.0/rel/riak/erts-5.8.2/bin/escript
~/build/riak-0.14.0/rel/riak/erts-5.8.2/bin/nodetool -name
riak@127.0.0.1 -setcookie riak ping

is returning ...

"Running Erlang
pong"

and as a result the "$RES" != "pong" is returning positive ie "Node is
not running!" ...

 if [ "$RES" != "pong" ]; then
 echo "Node is not running!"
 exit 1
 fi

... and it is running.

Has this been observed before? Was there a solution that I can use?
How do we suppress the "Running Erlang ~n"?

Thanks

Andrew
