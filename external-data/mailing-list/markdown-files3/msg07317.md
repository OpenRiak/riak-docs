Hello,Â 

Tx. to everyone who responded concerning mongoimport. I have decided an try and 
import some data using the bucket\_importer code supplied by Basho. When running 
it I get the following error....

bash: syntax error near unexpected token `'dev1@127.0.0.1','

My input:

bucket\_importer:import\_data('dev1@127.0.0.1', "buckettest", 
"/home/mark/output", "application/json").



I tried double quotes around dev1@127.0.0.1 and it still didn't work. Any 
suggestions?

Tx.
