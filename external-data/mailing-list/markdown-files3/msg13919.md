Thanks - this is somewhat reassuring (the ability to do some basic graph-like 
operations is one reason I have been using Riak).

I have so far not had cause to use MapReduce. I wonder if you know of any 
examples/docs for using MapReduce to perform an operation similar to 
link\_walking that I could use to get a head start?

Thanks,

Paul
