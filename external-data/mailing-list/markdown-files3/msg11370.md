This assumption is EXACTLY why we publish our own binary packages. You
don't need to know Erlang to run Riak, and haven't for years. When you
become an advanced user, yes, it is helpful, but it is not strictly
necessary. This is especially true of CS, and I'd much rather get the
bottom of Guy's problem than quibble about how hard Riak is to use "because
Erlang".

Again, we have had a Chef cookbook for years, and recently others in the
community have contributed solutions for Puppet.

We are working on exactly these problems, but they are difficult to get
right. Any suggestions on config syntaxes that work well for other products
are appreciated. For now we're looking at a format that resembles sysctl.

It might also be instructive to know that part of why the Erlang syntax in
config is inscrutable is that there's a lot of it. Three years ago, we had
one section -- 'riak' -- and there were maybe 5 options. Even with the
arcane syntax, that's not intimidating.
