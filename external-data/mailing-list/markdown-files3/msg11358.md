Hi Guy, 

Here is a good video introduction to configuring Riak CS Control:

http://basho.com/getting-started-with-riak-cs-control/

Let me know if you run into any specific issues and I'm happy to help. I'm 
also lurking in the #riak room on Freenode (nick: cmeiklejohn) if you need 
further help (any of us should be able to!)

- Chris
