Hi Weixi,

You might have to try describing your use case in more detail. Solr Indices 
are independent from Riak objects. They are, instead, associated with riak 
buckets (or bucket types), and an object (key/value) can only be associated 
with one bucket. Therefore, a Riak object can only be associated with one Solr 
index. A Solr index can be associated with multiple buckets, but in general 
the mapping from Riak objects to Solr indices is injective.

Is it possible that you changed the index associated with a bucket at some 
point in the bucket or bucket type lifecycle?
