TL;DR version: Riak works, storage overhead will be more than you think.

Good point, Alex, it was easy to forget about overhead.

I did some quick digging and the best info I can find is a delightful
exchange between Alex and I around April of last year [1] and this awesome
email from Nico Meyer back in May of 2011[2]. Another option is to use the
magical Bitcask capacity sizing page in the documentation[3]. Yes, it's for
Bitcask. No, I couldn't find something for LevelDB.

Based on Alex's recollection and Nico's math, you can expect between ~120
and ~380 bytes of overhead per object when you're using bitcask. LevelDB
should be similar, but compression may help out here if you're storing
repetitive values or if integer compression kicks in.

However, if you have any likelihood of updates in your application, you can
see additional growth in the object headers - vector clocks may grow and
there's always a possibility of siblings if writes come in fast (object
overhead goes up again with siblings being stored alongside the object).
