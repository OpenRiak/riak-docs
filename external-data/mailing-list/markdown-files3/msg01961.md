Put an apache (or whatever) server in front and proxy the requests accordingly 
and setup the security through the underlying web service. 


You -> [ apache -> riak ] (where [] is the box).

Or

You -> apache -> riak (where riak only allows requests from the apache server 
via the firewall on the riak server -- such as iptables)

The same problem exists in technologies like memcached.
