We are using levelDB as backend without any tuning.
Also we are aware that performance may suffer due to potentially storing
some of the copies (n=3) twice on the server. We are not so much concerned
about latencies caused by that.
What is worrying though is almost unbounded growth of swap used, which
essentially filled up our system disk.
Probably our Riak instances require some tuning but I would like to know
first why we need to tune it e.g. AAE consumes large swap.

Regarding failure scenarios. We've seen OS' oom-killer nuking beam.smp and
also our process due to the failure of memory allocation. So far we haven't
experienced situation where killing one node would cause cascading failures
of the nodes.

We were slightly reluctant to upgrade to 1.4 due to some AAE issues reported
on the mailing list.
I was under impression 1.4 may consume even more memory with AAE but I may
be totally wrong here.
