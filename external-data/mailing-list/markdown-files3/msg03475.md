Depending on the n\_val you have set for that bucket, Riak will store the 
objects n times on n different nodes. There are two other parameters you should 
know about, r and w. When writing, Riak will wait for w of the n nodes to 
finish the write before returning. When reading, Riak will wait for r of the n 
nodes to respond before returning. This is the basics of how Riak does fault 
and partition tolerance, i.e. if one node is down your cluster still functions, 
and the r and w vals define a sort of "majority vote" threshold to handle a 
split-brain problem.

Anyway, for your purposes you could set w=1 and r=3 for faster writes at the 
expense of potentially slower reads. I've never tried this (or any of the 
backends besides bitcask) so I don't know what you should expect.

As for bulk insert and preserving locality, I don't know of a way to do that 
with Riak except to batch your 1000 keys into a single object, identified by 
one key. As far as Riak is concerned, it's just a 12KB opaque object, which 
your application would need to always write and read all at once.

If you don't batch like that, you should look for a discussion on this mailing 
list from last week regarding capacity planning and very small objects. There's 
a bit of overhead associated with each object that will be significant for 
objects as small as 12 bytes. You could skip over the parts about Bitcask 
overhead...
