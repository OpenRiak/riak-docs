Hi Sean,

I have to object here. We have a cluster of 8 Core/64GB nodes with an
SSD drive for the bitcask dir. Each node holds on the order of 100Mio
keys. The complete bitcask directory is only about 60Gb big, so it fit
almost completely. 
The time from starting the node until it start handling requests, which
means all hint files have been read, is on the order of 10 minutes.
During this time the beam process is completely CPU bound, the disk is
hardly breaking a sweat.
Only 1 core is used at all, since there is only a single erlang process
starting all the vnodes sequentially. Sometimes a second core is also
utilized, but that is due to merges on the already started partitions.

Cheers,
Nico
