If you've installed from the apt/yum repository you've installed a single
Riak node on your machine. Riak, though, is configured by default to write
data to three servers. If some of those servers aren't available, Riak is
going to write to a different server via hinted handoff[1]. Since you are
only running one node, that single node receives all copies of your data in
the hopes that some day the other Riak servers in the cluster will come
back for their data.

Matthew's recommendation (change app.config, delete your data, start over)
is going to be your best bet for a single system approach.
