There is a lot of collected knowledge floating around about running
Riak on EC2 (both internally at Basho and in the greater community).
It's probably time we formalized it in the wiki for the good of all
Riak users. If you'll indulge me, I think we should take a stab at
outlining what a "Riak on EC2" Section should contain. To get us
started:

\* Ports and Port Management
\* Security
\* Backups
\* Recommended Instances
\* CloudFormation Templates

What else needs to be here?
