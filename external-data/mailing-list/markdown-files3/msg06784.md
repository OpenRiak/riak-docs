yes, i have a map http://stats.zmgc.net

if you open a second window and http://stats.zmgc.net/stats/1.gif on
the first window you will get the person icon

i have not yet implemented the storage of the data in riak, i am doing
this now, but i was wondering how to deal witha page refresh, i would
like to for example, load all the unique visitors persons who have
been added to the db in the last one hour for example.

and then any new persons who 'hits' http://stats.zmgc.net/stats/1.gif
is added from that point in time.

thanks
