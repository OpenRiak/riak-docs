As far as I understand you need to buy Riak EnterpriseDS to have any
guarantee for durability & availability for data you store in Riak:

“There are no guarantees that the (…) replicas will go to (N) separate
physical nodes; however, the built-in functions for determining where
replicas go attempts to distribute the data evenly."

http://wiki.basho.com/Replication.html#So-what-does-N%3D3-really-mean%3F


Basically, whatever N you set, they might end up on the same hard
disk, meaning that one hard disk crash can mean you lose data and/or
make data not readable. Probability is low, but it can happen.

Am I correct?

Kind regards
Runar
