At the very least we should have the
expected systems needs for AAE storage documented. There's probably a
middle-ground mitigated with documentation in the short term. We're trying
to freeze for 1.4 at the moment, but I'll make sure this gets some
discussion time after that's done.


I was a little surprised when I started getting low disk space alerts 
from my staging cluster after upgrading to 1.3.1 and turning on AAE. I 
checked and along with the 68GB leveldb directory I now also have a 
9.7GB anti\_entropy directory. That's a 14% overhead.


We've got the space (and this is why we test on staging before deploying 
to production) so it didn't break anything but people running close to 
full will be caught out by this.
