Jeff/Alexander,

Thanks for your replies. I do have both Xcode and Erlang installed.

$ ls /Developer
About Xcode and iOS SDK.pdf Extras Platforms
About Xcode.pdf Headers SDKs
Applications Icon? Tools
Documentation Library usr
Examples Makefiles

$ erl
Erlang R14B03 (erts-5.8.4) [source] [smp:4:4] [rq:4] [async-threads:0]
[hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V5.8.4 (abort with ^G)

Is there anything you want me to specifically check?

Thanks.
Geeth
