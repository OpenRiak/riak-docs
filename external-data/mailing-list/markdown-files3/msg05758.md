HI,

I am storing values of a devices under a particular OS. I want to fetch the 
list of all vallues, based on the key list. What I see if that, I can fetch the 
value one by one using the FETCH. Am using the HttpClient in Java. How do I go 
about this? Assume I am tryign to reach the same behavior like query that has 
"CONTAINS(key1, key2...). Is there a way to do this? or we can fetch the values 
only one by one. I do see that Map-reduce, makes use of the list fo keys, but 
am not sure if it is applicable in my case, as it ia simple 
fetch with collection of / list of keys.

Thanks
