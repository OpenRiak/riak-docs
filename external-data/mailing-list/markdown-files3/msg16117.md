Hey Syed,

I don't have an example to provide but I am assuming you could store the
image in Riak using the Bitstream encoding offered by the uGameDB lib.
Alternatively, you could probably parse the image as a binary string,
escape it and then store it within a json object using json encoding.

Here are two links with this info:
http://developer.muchdifferent.com/unitypark/uGameDB/SerializationMethods
http://developer.muchdifferent.com/unitypark/uLink/Serialization
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp\_data\_types.htm

Hope this helps you.
