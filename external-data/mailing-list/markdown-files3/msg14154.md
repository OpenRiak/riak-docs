Hi guys,

So, I’ve created a bunch of services to allow clients to store and retrieve 
data from Riak CS. What I’d like to be able to do is to create new users from 
Erlang so that Riak CS can manage all the storage and access data for each 
user. I’m currently using Erlcloud to access Riak CS. Does anyone know the 
best way to create users from Erlang (preferably with Erlcloud)?

Thanks,
Lee
