I would probably say complex/fewer MR phases but I guess it would depend on the 
compute complexity of your functions (in order to take advantage of 
parallelism/more compute cores). My reasoning is that every time you Map you 
are reading the full value from disk. More Maps = more disk i/o. Not to mention 
the erlang to js overhead if you are running js functions.

Please report your findings!

Best,
