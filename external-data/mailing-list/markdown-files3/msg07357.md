Riak EDS (which is the fancy name for the Riak distro that includes the
N-way datacenter replication code) works differently than Cassandra in this
respect. People running EDS set up complete clusters in N datacenters that
are all actively participating in cluster activities. Conversely,
Cassandra's network topology strategies work because they spread one
cluster over N datacenters (last time I checked).

Feel free to shoot me an email off list if you want to more info about EDS.
