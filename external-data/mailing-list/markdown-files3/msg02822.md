Hi,
I'm wondering if anyone with a riak application that uses the Java client wants 
to put a pre-release of the 0.14.1 client through its paces?

If you use maven just point to this repo

https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/combashoriak-045/

and update your dependency to 0.14.1

it is just a bug fix release, but a little community validation won't hurt 
before I push it to central.

Please let me know if you try this release out. If I hear nothing bad I'll push 
to central next week for all to enjoy.

Cheers

Russell
