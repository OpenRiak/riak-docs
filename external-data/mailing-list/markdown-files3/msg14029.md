Hi Ray,

Deletion is replicated by both real-time and full-sync MDC - specifically,
the tombstone representing the deletion will be replicated. The delete\_mode
setting affects how long a tombstone remains "alive" for MDC to replicate
it (3 seconds by default). If only full-sync MDC is used, the delete\_mode
should be modified to allow a long enough lifetime for a full-sync
operation to replicate the tombstone.
