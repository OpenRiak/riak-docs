Hi all,

Today Basho released a minor update to Riak and Riak Enterprise
(version 1.4.9). This is a bug-fix release that addresses regressions
with the memory backend and includes enhancements to LevelDB
compaction.

Release notes and package downloads are available below:

- https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.4/RELEASE-NOTES.md
- http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/downloads/
- https://github.com/basho/leveldb/wiki/mv-hot-threads

(Package repositories have been updated as well.)

As always, thank you for being part of the community.

Sincerely,

The Basho Team
