Hi all,

I am trying to set the Erlang scheduler bind type to nnts by adding the
following to vm.args:

+stbt nnts

In theory stbt is supposed to handle lack of support properly, but instead
my server fails to start. However it starts with just +sbt nnts.

Here is the Erlang doc on the flag: http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html#+sbt

Has anyone run into this? How can I see what's failing?

Cheers,

Alain
