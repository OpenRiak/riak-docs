I'd like to run Riak in a single-node installation as a datastore for
my application, when running in small single-available environments.
Is there anything that speaks against doing so? I'm thinking that in
such a setup, nVal should be set to 1 - everything else makes no
sense, right? Would you also set the ring-size to 1?

Thanks for your views and comments,
Henning
