Markus,

You're correct in that backup/restore currently doesn't work with search.
 You could still use that method but would have to reindex everything which
would require list keys. In our next minor version method #2 will get
better but it will require you to upgrade. Another method is to write some
code to directly convert one backend's data to another. Then you would
take each node down one at a time, run custom code to convert, switch
backends in config file, then restart node.
