The short answer is "yes, that's possible". That said, at the moment I'm
not aware of any existing code/resources that could walk you through it.
Anyone have anything they can share?

Keep in mind that running something like this over all your data is going
to put a lot of load on your cluster and might lead to some timeouts and
interesting debugging. Out of curiosity, how many keys do you need to
update?
