Excellent points, Alex.

When you compare Riak's storage overhead to something like an RDBMS where you 
have maybe 24 bytes for row overhead (as is the case for PostgreSQL), you'll 
find that there's a tremendous economy of space elsewhere.

Riak is going to excel in applications where reads and writes will be truly 
random. Yes, there are Map Reduce features, but randomly organized data is 
still randomly organized data.

If you look at RDBMSes, horizontally partitioning your system through RDBMS 
features (SQL Server's partitioned tables, PostgreSQL's partitioned views, for 
example), gives you the ability to take advantage of many known quantities in 
that world - range queries can take advantage of sequential scan speeds across 
rotational disks.


Do any of the 'other' tools that might be better at handling small or 
naturally-ordered bits of data match riak's ability to scale up and down 
or handle schema changes without a lot of human intervention?
