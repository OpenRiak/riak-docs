Cheers indeed!
You added HEAD requests so a full GET wouldn't always be required?
Did I read that right? \*dives into code\*
%% GET requests first follow the path of a HEAD request, and if an object is
%% found, then fetch the value from the Journal via the Inker.
... WHAT?

Very nice work, will be more than happy to provide feedback and patches on this.
