Is it possible to update only headers on an object?

In writing the Riak spring-data support, I'm having to update objects in their 
entirety to manage relationships between them. In one operation I might create 
an object and in another, I might add a link to it (after I've saved the new 
child object). I'm sending the body content back when I add the links or set 
the metadata, but this seems like overkill (and fragile). Is there a way to set 
only headers on an object? I'd like to just add a Link header without having to 
process all the existing Link headers, throwing out any I don't care about 
(like rel="up", et al), add my new Link, then put all that stuff back into the 
store.

If this capability doesn't exist, is there a way I can write a plugin to 
implement it? Or would it require hacking Riak core?

Or is there a better way entirely?

Thanks!
