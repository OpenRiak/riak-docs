I believe that you will \*always\* need to do this. Without
transactions, you can always end up with cruft. Best you can do is
minimize how often you need to run the scavenge process.

These logs need to be stored \*somewhere\*, but that storage could also
fail. That is why I believe you'll need a periodic full scan for
garbage.

(and note this applies whether "storage" is memory, disk, Riak, or
whatever else)

This will minimize your scans, but not eliminate them. You may not be
able to write to the "cleanup" bucket because you've lost all network
connectivity to the Riak cluster. Not a bad assumption, given that you
could not write out B (what makes you think you could write to
"cleanup"?).

Personally, rather than attempting to write something else to a
failing Riak cluster, I'd suggest keeping these keys in memory along
with a background thread that periodically attempts to clean them up.
You're gonna lose the keys if the client dies, but hey... as I said:
best you can do is to minimize the full scans.
