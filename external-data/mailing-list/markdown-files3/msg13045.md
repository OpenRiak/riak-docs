I've installed a single node Riak cluster using the 5 minute install
guideand
modified the app.config riak\_core to include {target\_n\_val, 1} and
{default\_bucket\_props, [{n\_val, 1}]}. I've also set an IP address of
192.168.2.25, and set the HTTP port to 10018 respectively.

With this setup, no matter what HTTP request I execute, I receive the error
below.

Does anyone know what I've done wrong?

\* About to connect() to 192.168.2.25 port 10018 (#0)
