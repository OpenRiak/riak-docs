The Antidote project, developed on top of Riak Core, has many of these
properties and is under continuing development by a group in France,
Belgium, Portugal, and Germany.

https://github.com/syncfree/antidote

It's a research project at the moment, but we're working on making it
industrial grade. It shares many of the same (or better) properties:
CRDTs, causal consistency, designed for geo-replication; however,
doesn't have search functionality and only has limited client
libraries at the moment.

I'm happy to answer any other questions you might have about it.

Thanks,
Christopher
