James,

What mechanism are you trying to implement? Generally, it's not a good
way to let your database operate the format of your data.

For example, if you want to store some lists of data and append new
items to them or remove existing ones, you won't need Riak to check
data types itself. All such checks should be handled by your Erlang
code.

But if you are speaking of Riak data consistency, it has two major
features for that: multi-values and vector-clocks. The first feature
guarantees that you won't lose any important data and will be able to
compare your old and new values and decide their consistency manually.
And the second one offers very reliable automatic consistency checks
that can solve consistency problems in many cases.
