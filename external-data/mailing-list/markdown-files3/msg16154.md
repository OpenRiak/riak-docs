Hi Mohamad.

Good questions. You can install Stanchion on the HA proxy load balancer
node, or a separate standalone node, whichever you prefer.

Stanchion exists only to provide serialization (essentially, a gatekeeper
process) for the creation of new users and new buckets, only. As you
mentioned, only 1 Stanchion node can be active at a time. If Stanchion
fails, users will still be able to read and write from existing buckets and
objects, but no new users or new buckets will be created until it returns.
You can keep a spare Stanchion node on standby (similar to how you can keep
a spare HA proxy node) and activate it if the first one goes down.
