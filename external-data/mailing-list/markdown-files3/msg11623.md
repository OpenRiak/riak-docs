Hi Joey,

When using secondary indexes the index names must end in either `\_int` for 
integer indexes or `\_bin` for binary indexes in order for them to be recognised 
by the system [1]. All indexes must be set when you write the objects.

You must also ensure that the bucket you are writing the objects to are using 
either the memory or leveldb backends as bitcask does not support secondary 
indexes. Can you verify that this is the case? Are there any error messages in 
the logs?

Which exact client version are you using?

Best regards,

Christian
