Hello everyone,

I have setup a Riak test node in a VPS with n = 1, r = 1 and w =1, Bitcask
engine and AAE turned off.. loaded some 8k blobs into it and everything was
fine...

Today, after three weeks, I noticed that a few of those 8K blobs are
missing - not found...

I also see a lot of invalid HintFile error in the console.log

Can anybody explain why this is happening?

Thanks in advance.

Best,

Praveen Baratam
