Hi all,

I was wondering if there's an established pattern where the value of one key 
can consistently be accessed via a different key. I'm thinking of something 
analogous to an HTTP 303 See Other.

I imagine I could achieve this via link walking, but that suggests applying a 
level of indirection to just about everything, or initiating all link walks 
with both the direct and indirect case.

Hmm. That's pretty abstract. How about this:

I have a bunch of stub user profiles that could be generated via multiple 
social networks. Once the user establishes their credentials on our system, it 
would be good to be able to reference existing data via a new, 
internally-generated user id without special-casing any link walks or 
map-reduces.
