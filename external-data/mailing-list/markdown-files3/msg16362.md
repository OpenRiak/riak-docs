Humberto and I had a conversation privately that resulted in the answer:

"Thanks for your interest, but I just received a great help from
Christopher Meiklejohn.

The problem was the compiler, I was using GCC-5.1 because in the
documentation of riak
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/installing/mac-osx/#From-Source)
says "Riak will not compile with Clang. Please make sure that your
default C/C++ compiler is GCC", but this is wrong and it was the
source of my problem. I just restore Clang as the default compiler and
it works OK."

We'll need to make a note of this on the doc repository [1]. Updates
like these are always best from real users. Please open issues on the
URL below for any and all inconsistencies you run into!
