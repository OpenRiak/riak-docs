Hi,

I'm trying authentication by using riak-ruby-vagrant(\*).
(\*) https://github.com/basho-labs/riak-ruby-vagrant

But I can not connect HTTPS when I enabled security.

If I ignore certificate, I can get expected response from riak.
Here it is.


Problem is if I remove "-k" option from curl command, tls related error
occurs.
How can I connect riak-ruby-vagrant with HTTPS?
I know this is not riak's problem, but I could not find a cause of this
problem for a couple of days.
Please someone help!



Thank you,
Masanori Takahashi
