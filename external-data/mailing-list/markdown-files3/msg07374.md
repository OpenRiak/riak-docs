Sorry for the confusion. I didn't clear the rings one node at a time while 
keeping other nodes live. Following are the steps I followed:
1. Stop Riak on all the nodes.
2. Remove ring directory from all nodes.
3. Start the nodes and rejoin.

Yeah, we are currently serving very limited amount because of Riak shortage. In 
total, we have almost 750 million documents served by Riak.

We have currently stopped the cluster and running on small amount of data. We 
can wait for the partition re-distribution to complete on Riak, but I don't 
have a strong feeling about it. "member\_status" doesn't give us a correct 
picture: http://pastie.org/3849548. Is this expected behavior? I should also 
mention that all the nodes are still loading existing data and it will take few 
hours (2-3) until Riak KV is running on all of them.
