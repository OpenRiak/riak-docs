This bug fix did not make the 1.3.2 release. It is slated for the 1.4
release that will be out soon. Not all issues make it into point releases
unfortunately so we have to pick and chose based on severity and complexity
of the change. Sorry this is causing you maintenance headaches, we
certainly don't like hearing that.

I can assure you it is in 1.4, so 1.3.2 is the last time you'll have to
work around it.

Thanks,
Jared
