Riak Recap for Feb. 11 - 13

1) Basho just announced a new, free Webinar. This will be all about
Riak, Luwak and MapReduce and will be led by Basho Hacker Bryan Fink.
The date and time are Thursday, Feb 17th at 2PM EST (and yes, we will
be recording it for those of you who might have time zone or other
conflicts.)

2) Q --- How do I run cluster\_info ? (from crucially via #riak)

A --- http://wiki.basho.com/Command-Line-Tools.html#cluster\_info

3) seancribbs, Ferdirand and mulander had a conversation in #riak
about using Riak as part of a "distributed Nagios application."

4) Potential Riak job "for freelance work involving data replication
and document-oriented databases."

5) Riak got a non-trivial mention somewhere in this podcast (sadly I
haven't had the chance to listen to it yet) --->
