Dear All,
We are pleased to announce the release of Riak CS 2.1.2 in coordination with 
Stanchion 2.1.2.
As well as the standard bug fixes you'll be expecting, Riak CS 2.1.2 includes 
experimental support for signature\_v4 authentication and experimental support 
for Leveled - the soon to be released alternate backend to LevelDB in Riak KV 
2.9.
Stanchion 2.1.2 was originally produced by Basho and mothballed when Basho 
halted Riak CS 2.1.2 development. Stanchion changes are basically a move to 
node package 3.0. Functionality is otherwise identical.

Compatibility: Riak CS 2.1.2 and Stanchion 2.1.2 have been successfully tested 
with Riak KV 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.2.6 and 2.9.0 (release candidate). Please 
see the Release Notes for Riak CS for upgrade information at 
https://github.com/basho/riak\_cs/blob/2.1.2/RELEASE-NOTES.md.

Packages are available to download from 
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/cs/2.1/2.1.2/ and 
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/stanchion/2.1/2.1.2/ accordingly. Should you 
encounter any issues, please report them on https://github.com/basho/riak\_cs/ 
or https://github.com/basho/stanchion/

Best regards,

Nicholas
