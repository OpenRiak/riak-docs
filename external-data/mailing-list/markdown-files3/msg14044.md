Hi,

What's the latest non-standard version of this function? v3 right? If 
Basho adds more versions to this, is this somewhere documented?


For our nodes standard choose/wants claim functions were doing a weird 
distribution so the numbers even out a bit better (just a bit better) by 
using v3, so it would be nice to know if improvements are done in this 
area and where they are being documented.


As of the latest 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/configs/configuration-files/
both parameters have no default where my understanding is that the 
default for both is v2.


Regards,

Guido.
