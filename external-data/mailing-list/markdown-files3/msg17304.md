Hello All,

Just in time for a well deserved weekend, here’s what’s been going on since
the last recap.

Rejoice - Riak TS 1.3 has been open sourced! Such applause and much
appreciation to all the engineers, documentors, testers and everyone else
at Basho who worked to get this mega release out the door. Let’s not forget
all the customers who had input in shaping the product roadmap, a hearty
thank you to you as well. Thank you all!

As always, we want to hear from you. If you are working on or speaking
about something Riak related and would like to be highlighted - send me a
note! Let me know what you’re up to and I’ll get your talk or blog post in
the next Riak Recap.


## Announcements


 -

 Riak TS 1.3 has been released. This is the first open source release and
 we are all very excited to see what you do with it. There are a ton of new
 features so please check the release notes [0], read the announcement [1]
 from our CTO, Dave McCrory, or review my architecture post on Riak TS [2]
 to learn more. Then download [3] Riak TS and let us know what you think!



## Community Events


 -

 Craig Vitter will be speaking in NYC this Tuesday, May 10th, on Riak TS
 in a talk entitled “Easy Time Series Analysis with Riak TS, Python, Pandas
 & Jupyter” [4]. This will be a great introduction to working with Riak TS.
 -

 Alexander Sicular will be speaking in Dallas on May 13th about Riak KV
 and assorted friends, Solr, Redis and Spark at the Global Big Data
 Conference in Dallas [5]. That’s me, come say hello.
 -

 Seema Jethani, Director of Product, @seemaj, will be speaking at Data By
 the Bay in San Francisco on May 19th on working with time series data from
 the London Air Quality Network in Riak TS and other projects [6].

## Recently Answered


 -

 Anil was looking for ways to index various Java data objects in Riak via
 Solr but Fred lets us know that Riak communicates with Solr over http and
 not SolrJ. You would either need to build your own custom extractor (which
 is possible and has been done) or serialize to a neutral format like JSON
 [10].
 -

 Doug confirms some versioning ambiguities for David [11]. Riak is
 comprised of modules that get their own version numbers independent from
 Riak KV (or S2 or TS) version numbers.
 -

 Fred helps answer Fasil’s question on modifying the solrconfig.xml but
 it’s a bit involved [12]. Luke proposes a simpler solution - consider
 modifying the input data so as not to require modifying the config file
 [13].
 -

 Fred provides a link to Riak’s code in github to help answer Alexander’s
 question on POST-ing to the Solr http end point [14].
 -

 Magnus points Sanket in the right direction regarding his question on
 working with CRDT’s from the erlang client [15].
 -

 Fred points out to Ricardo that Riak loves eating fd’s (file
 descriptors) … so bump up those ulimits! [16].
 -

 Luke confirms that “not found’s” need to be accounted for when executing
 map/reduce operations. They will throw a “not\_found” error which needs to
 be managed [17].




## Open Discussions


 -

 Alex is looking for advice regarding whether or not Riak TS would be
 better suited in certain use cases over Riak KV for his social network
 project [18].
 -

 Michael is looking for some guidance on properly sizing a Riak S2
 cluster [19].
 -

 Psterk is looking for help on using hadoops’s distcpy to copy files from
 Riak S2 to hadoop [20][21].
 -

 Basho engineer and resident CRDT expert, Russell Brown, is soliciting
 feedback [22] on Riak DT [23], the module that provides CRDT cpabilities
 in Riak.
 -

 A number of folks are working with Guillaume to get to the bottom of
 slow 99th percentile performance in a lengthy thread that touches on
 levelDB and Solr based enhancements [24].
 -

 Johnny is looking for help working with credentials in Riak S2 [25].
 -

 A number of folks contribute to a great thread helping Alex on his
 question about write performance when writing sequential alpha-numeric keys
 [26]. There is a sidebar on CRDT’s vs write\_once buckets in there as well
 [27].




Till next time,
