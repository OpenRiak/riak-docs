Hey All,

I'll be in Baltimore tomorrow for the Riak Meetup happening at the OmniTI
offices [1]. If you're in the area, you should attend.

I'm also going to have a few hours of free time tomorrow and Friday if
anyone wants to get together and chat Riak. Let me know if you're
interested.

Best,

Mark
