After giving this a bit more thought, the "TrapExit" method is not going to 
work for me. The rpc:multicall() function evaluates the function on all visible 
nodes. My client app is not on the riak cluster, so cannot access the cluster 
directly. I will have to follow the method of creating the function in a string.

Cheers,
Ryan
