Resizing the ring is a well known issue. A singleton riak with stock 64 ring 
size should only consume more fd's. 

What concerns me is the reluctance to change the n\_val (replication factor). I 
was under the impression this was not an issue and could be changed at any 
time. I thought read repair would read a value and adjust its replication as 
necessary. Please elaborate why this isn't the case. 

For the following reasons and the fact that developing apps for riak is pretty 
simple, I've been using singleton riak deployments for a long time. I use this 
type of setup mostly for throwaway development projects but also because if 
your project does get big or need more power it's trivial to ramp up. 

Thoughts?
