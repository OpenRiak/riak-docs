Hi Istvan,

It looks like you are restoring an entire cluster, not just a single node 
within a cluster. If so, the relevant recovery procedures are documented on 
this page:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/recovery/failure-recovery/#Cluster-Recovery-From-Backups
 


Can you try following the full cluster recovery procedure and see if that 
solves the problem?
