I hate it too but my point still stands, if DO NOT FETCH, what's the 
target object the mutation should work with? Isn't it the passed object 
instead?


Anyway, I sent a pull request which hopefully applies a better 
semantics: https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/pull/271


Thanks,

Guido.

Guido,

In this case it appears that fetching is enabled i.e. if (!doNotFetch) 
i.e. if NOT doNotFetch... so basically doNotFetch = false (fetching is 
true / enabled).


I hate the double negative cases since it's easy to get confused / 
miss the logic that was intended.

YN shared this with you.

Brian,

In StoreObject's execute() method, this condition, is it a bug or intended?

 ...
 ...
 if (!doNotFetch) {
 resolved = fetchObject.execute();
 vclock = fetchObject.getVClock();
 }
 ...
 ...

My reasoning is: if do not fetch then shouldn't the resolved object be
the one passed? I'm doing some tests and if I do store a mutation
returning the body without fetching, I get a new mutated object and not
the one I passed + mutation. So I'm wondering if that was the original
intention.

Thanks,

Guido.
