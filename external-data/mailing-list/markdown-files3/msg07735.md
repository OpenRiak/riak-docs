Subject: Re: Cannot Install Riak
To: Bogunov 


Hello,

Thanks for the help. I made some progress and I got it working using the
1.1.2 build.

But I wanted to try multiple nodes on local machine which requires a build
from source. Now I'm getting more issues.

Please see here:

Thanks for your time. Sorry if I sound moody. This just annoyed me because
I was so excited to play with riak and erlang. ah well - such is life.
