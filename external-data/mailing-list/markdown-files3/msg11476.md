Hi all,

Trying to optimize our application connection pool, we encountered and issue 
with Corrugated Iron and identifying idle/reset connections. Namely, if our 
network infrastructure (firewall/proxy/etc) closes an idle connection - we're 
getting a 'cluster is offline' error code.

I saw that this is a feature in the making (for the past 8 months), but I was 
wondering if any of you found a way around it?

Thank you,
Amir Halatzi,
