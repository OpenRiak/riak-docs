So I'm the lucky fellow assigned to try to implement some of the
requests in this thread. I have some changes in the
az259-enhance-pbc-api branches on riak\_kv and on the riak-erlang client:

https://github.com/basho/riak-erlang-client/commits/az259-enhance-pbc-api
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/commits/az259-enhance-pbc-api

Changes include conditional get [{if\_modified, VClock}], conditional put
[if\_none\_match], [if\_not\_modified] and a way to get the metadata of an
object without its value; [head].

Let me know if this addresses some of the pain points and if there's
anything else missing. Bucket properties are one we already know about.

Andrew
