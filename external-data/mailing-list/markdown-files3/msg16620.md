Hi List,

would you say that storing billions of very small (json) files is a good
usecase for riak kv or cs?

here's what I would do:

\* create daily buckets ( i.e. 2015-10-07)
\* up to 130 Million inserts per day
\* about 150.000 read-ony accesses/day
\* no updates on existing keys/files
\* delete buckets (including keys/files) older than x days


I already have a working riak-kv/leveldb cluster (inserts and lookups are
 going smoothly), but when it comes to mass deletion of keys I found no way
to do this.


Best,

David
