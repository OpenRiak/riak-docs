Hi everyone,
I have some questions regarding key composition and secondary indexes.

Key filters seem really useful, and because of this, I find myself designing
keys that have (perhaps) too many elements within them.

 - Are there any best practices concerning key composition?
 - Does the composition of a key in a bitcask setup influence speed? (It
 seems to in 
Innodb
 )
 - Is there a maximum key length?

Lastly, do integrated secondary indexes exist in Riak yet? This link
suggests they are
coming
but
I've been unable to find any other evidence of their arrival.

Thanks!
Ryan
