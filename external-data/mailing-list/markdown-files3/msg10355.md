Thanks for the detailed explanation of what you're seeing. As it turns out, 
your results are typical.

Usually the deletion happens automatically across all nodes, but as you've 
seen, there's no guarantee of that. Reading a key will trigger read repair to 
clean up lingering objects, and is effectively the only way to do so.

Active anti-entropy in Riak 1.3.0 has most of what's necessary to automatically 
clean up all deleted objects, but that is not a current feature. I'll make sure 
a ticket is filed with that feature request.
