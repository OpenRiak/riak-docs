The other option of course, is to pre-process your data and just insert 
multiple copies in different formats, which is a pretty common pattern. The 
tradeoff is whether you want to pay the cost at query time or at write time. 
If you can pay that cost up-front, reads will likely be key-value or very 
simple MapReduce and thus very fast.
