Vladimir,

You have one of two problems, either there is something in one of the existing 
.sst files causing compaction to crash, or there is some type of threading 
problem that crash during the hash/bloom creation. I am going to assume an 
.sst file problem for now.

The last time you crashed, only 6 vnodes were actively compacting. Their 
directory names start as follows:

 21694
 23977
 473846
 65082
 7478777
 7707137

I leave it to you to copy and paste the full directory names.

The first step is to find which directory is crashing. Use the instructions 
here

https://gist.github.com/gburd/b88aee6da7fee81dc036

BUT instead of "eleveldb:repair", use "eleveldb:open". Wait five minutes after 
each open to see if each vnode's compactions run completely without crashing.

If one crashes, that is where the problem exists. If none of them crash, then 
there is a threading / race condition … and I will have to think on how to 
diagnose.

Matthew
