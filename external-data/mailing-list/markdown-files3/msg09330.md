See:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/choosing-a-backend/LevelDB/

Look for the section titled "Parameter Planning". It has the best content.

Keep in mind that leveldb maps most of its files into memory. So the RSS 
(resident set size) is BOTH the memory you allocate via parameters and the 
memory mapped data files.

Our other thread is likely a disk thrashing problem, but we can help it by 
tuning the memory. Each vnode opens an independent recovery log. Each data 
item goes to log before the write operation returns. You are constantly 
writing to 512 different places on the disk â€¦ plus leveldb's regular 
"compaction" runs â€¦ or that at least is my theory of the moment.
