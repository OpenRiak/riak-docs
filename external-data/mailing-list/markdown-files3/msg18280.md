It's pretty strange that you are seeing no search latency measurements on node 
5. Are you sure your round robining is working? Are you favoring node 1?

In general, I don't think which node you hit for query should make a 
difference, but I'd have to stare at the code some to be sure. In essence, all 
the node that services the query does is convert the query into a sharded Solr 
query based on a coverage plan, which changes every minute or so, and then runs 
the sharded query on the local Solr node. The Solr node then distributes the 
query to the rest of the nodes in the cluster, but that's all Solr comms -- 
Riak is out of the picture, by then.

Now, if you have a lot of sharded queries accumulating on one node, that might 
make a difference to Solr. I am not a Solr expert, and I don't even play one 
on TV. But maybe the fact that you are not hitting node 5 is relevant for that 
reason?

Can you do more analysis on your client, to make sure you are not favoring node 
1?
