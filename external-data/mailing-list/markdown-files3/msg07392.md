Hi Dmitry,

I was actually able to solve this problem a while back. I was also told that 
the changes would be pushed to Github, I haven't had cause to check if this was 
actually done.

The problem was with some files in the 
/usr/lib/riak/lib/riak\_control-0.1.0/priv directory. It's somewhat of a timeout 
issue in one of the javascript files.

If you like I could tell you what you need to update to get it working?!

Cheers.

Charles.

Hi, Charles.

We are experiencing the same problem. I replaced all the files with
the newest ones, not result. Restarted Riak just in case â€“Â still the
same.

For what it's worth, the CSS that is being served (by webmachine, I
guess) has content-type "text/html".

Also, I have very long ping to our servers (200-500ms), and when
riak\_control main page is loading I can see it for about a second.
Then this white non-CSS'ed page appears. But the folks that reside in
SF close to the servers say they don't even see the home page, just
this "Current Snapshot" stuff.

Riak version is 1.1.2.

Please let me know if you need to know anything else.

Thank you.
