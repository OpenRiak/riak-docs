Hi Jeff,

Segmenting the keys based on some random number will allow you to run smaller 
jobs, but if you still need to run all the batches in order to get a result, I 
am not sure you have gained much. Exactly what the best way to process and 
prepare data depends highly on your use case and what your access patterns will 
look like and how you need to query your access/data.

One way to spread the cost of aggregating data may be to add a timestamp as a 
secondary index and periodically aggregate data for specific time periods that 
make sense to your application. Further aggregation can then later be based on 
these aggregation records rather than the individual records, which will most 
likely be much faster.

If you can provide additional details about your use case, expected access 
patterns and queries we might be able to help better. If you do not feel 
comfortable sharing it here on the list, please feel free to email me directly.

Best regards,

Christian
