Hi gibraltar,

A few things come to mind:

\* Sean Cribbs and Mathias Meyer wrote an app called Riaktant [1] that uses
riak-js. (Note: this hasn't been touched in about a year so you might have
to update it in various parts.)
\* The Riak Handbook [2] has some extensive code examples using riak-js.

Hope that helps. Have fun.
