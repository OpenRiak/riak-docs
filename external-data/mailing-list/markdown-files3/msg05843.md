I am putting in 2i right now.

Obvious first thoughts:

1) Why is there a "bucket" as well as index->value? Why are indexes
not "global?" Since getting all keys for a bucket requires a keyspace
walk, why do we need to pass a bucket parameter? What is the
relationship here?

2) No ordering of results : can be done via custom MR, so not the
biggest deal in the world but you end up with a potentially massive
result set if you only want a range. (First 100, last 100, etc.)

3) No multi-index checking. This is a huge lacking feature.

4) Having >75% (WAG) of the examples in more-limiting HTTP/cURL
syntax really really really annoys me, but I'm probably in the
minority here. :)

I think you guys are on to something, because the 2i concept is great
but it needs some flushing out to really be useful. I'm looking
forward to the day when I can say "this index between these two date
ranges, and a max result of 100 items ordered by date." Yes, I can do
that right now via MR, but I have to suck in the whole result set and
filter/sort by hand in the reduce phase. (Yes, it would be nice for
you to do more work so I do not have to! But your work would be more
portable and reusable for the userbase than mine is. :)
