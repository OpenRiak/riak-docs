I have built a production like prototype using riak-core. My major issue was 
luck of documentation (out-dated or missing aspects). So I spent about 5-7 days 
in reading source code and writing tests. I think a simple sequence digram of 
hinted hand-off would answer on many my questions. Please let me know if you 
want to chat over phone to get more details. I'm in Bay area also. 

Thank you,
Konstantin.
