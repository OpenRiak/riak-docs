Hi everybody,

I have a couple of questions regarding the performance requirements for a
12TB Riak cluster, specifically:

1) I wonder if four servers, each one with the following spec, can handle
it: 6 cores at 2.20GHz (15MB cache), 16GB of memory, and two 3TB HDD in a
Raid 1 configuration. And if not, what would be the recommended number of
machines we should provision. These machines are physical machines. We
execute one or two M/R jobs per day, the scripts are written in Erlang.

2) Since we have two HDD per server in a Raid 1 configuration, I also
wonder if we can safely set the replication factor to one, since the data
is already stored twice: if we lose an HDD, we still got the data on the
other one thanks to the Raid 1 conf.

Thanks
