Well, riak\_core is pretty generic, so you might be able to use it even with
multiple sites and stores, but you would for instance get replication, and
ring expansion. But is does require a bit of work, and if you have something
that works for you, there's usually not a reason to change unless you get
something you don't already have.

A lot of the basho libraries are packaged separately so are easy to include
via rebar.

We have a custom database we built to keep windowed, rolling time series data,
in addition we've played with managing sets of fastbit indexes with riak\_core
as well.
