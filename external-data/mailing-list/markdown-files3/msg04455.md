I have deleted all the keys from all buckets manually and \*before deleting \*
the\* \*keys the size of \*bitcask

\*directory was \*6.4 GB \*and after deleting it is showing me the same i.e \*6.4
GB\*.

So to run bitcask merging process i have added this line

 {riak\_kv\_bitcask\_backend, [
 {small\_file\_threshold, 335544320}
 ]}


in my app.config . I have added this line because size of all data file in
bitcask directory are ( < 320 MB ) .

but bitcask merging process is not running . Is there any solution to run
bitcask merge process so that i can reduce size of my bitcask directory ??
