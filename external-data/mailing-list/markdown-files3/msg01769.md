Riak Recap for Dec. 8 - 9

1) Andrew McKnight wrote up a quick blog post on the idea of using
Sparql with Riak.

Post here ---> http://andrewmcknight.blogspot.com/2010/12/sparql-on-riak.html

2) J. Brisbin continues to do awesome work on his quest to add Riak
support to Spring Data.

Updated Riak info on the Spring Data wiki --->
https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-keyvalue/wiki/Spring-Data-support-for-Riak

Some new code here ---> https://github.com/grails/inconsequential

3) Sean Cribbs added audio to the slides he used for the "Schema
Design in Riak" Webinar this past Tuesday.

Watch and listen here --->

4) @bradleyktaylor made creative use of a Riak sticker that I sent
him. I thought it was worth sharing.
