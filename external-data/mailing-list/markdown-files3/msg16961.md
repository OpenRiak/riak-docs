Given the tunables that Riak has, I would say that its reliability in
terms of consistency (as in ACID) are unparalleled. It offers a
variety of weak consistency options from eventual consistency, to
strong eventual consistency, to strong consistency\*.

In terms of fault-tolerance, it is interesting. Riak hides faults in
funny ways where other databases would degrade. It instead does a
really good job of hiding faults. This can be problematic, because
often the signal for a database degrading can be "the website is
flakey".

\* This is "experimental"
