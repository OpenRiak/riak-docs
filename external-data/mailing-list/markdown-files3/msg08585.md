Hey riak-users,

The Ripple library, which lets you create document-style abstractions
on top of riak-ruby-client, has moved to
https://github.com/basho/ripple. This will allow other members of the
Basho organization and community to contribute in ways that aren't
bottlenecked by me, as my responsibilities have been focused elsewhere
recently. Future gem releases will be managed by Bryce Kerley or Randy
Secrist, with assistance from the existing committers.

If you are using Ripple from the git repository, please update your
remotes to adjust for this change.

Cheers,
