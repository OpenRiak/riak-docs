Urvi,

That message is just a little bit of text that appears as part of the server
description and hence you can ignore it.

In Riak, you can't create Buckets. Buckets are not an entity, they are just
used in conjunction with the Key to create a hash that identifies the
document/object you're storing.

Just PUT a document to /riak/bucket/key and the bucket will "exist" at that
point. Remember that if you're going to PUT or POST you'll need to send it
some content (using the -d or --data-binary flags in CURL).

Hope that helps
OJ
