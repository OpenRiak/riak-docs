For large numbers of objects, your JavaScript functions will become 
bottlenecks, largely because the data has to be converted to and from JSON for 
every application of the function. If your reduce function isn't actually 
coalescing a value (e.g. sort doesn't), then you will run into this problem. 
See if you can reimplement the functions in Erlang or decrease the quantity of 
values being passed to and returned from the reduce functions.
