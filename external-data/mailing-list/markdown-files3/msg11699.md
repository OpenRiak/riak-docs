Re your last Q:

> I have read StoreObject does a read on every write, if true, can that
be disabled?

Yes. If you're not worried about creating siblings you can use the
withoutFetch() option in the StoreObject:

storeObject.withoutFetch().execute();

The StoreObject will not attempt to fetch the existing value (nor do
conflict resolution) when that's specified.

Also worth asking is how/when are you constructing your Bucket object?
By default the Java client does a fetch for bucket properties when you
call IRiakClient.fetchBucket(bucketName).execute()

This can be disabled by using:

Bucket b = client.fetchBucket(bucketName).lazyLoadBucketProperties().execute();

Thanks!
