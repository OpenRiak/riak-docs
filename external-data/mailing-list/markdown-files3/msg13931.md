Certainly, but that makes the KV storage redundant. If that is really the
suggested solution, then there may as well be a null storage KV backend.

Of curse, a null KV backend is not sufficient, given that writes to
Yokozuna happen asynchronously and that AAE is used to ensure KV and
Yomozuna are in sync. You'd also need to make writes to Yokozuna
synchronous with the client request and disable AAE as there is nothing to
sync with.
