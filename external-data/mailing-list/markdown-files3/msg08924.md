Hi Evan,

regarding the swappiness and disk scheduling: these were set to default, I will 
correct it and run another test. 

The hosting provider sets the computer with software RAID1 over 2 physical 
disks, do you think it is useful with Riak?

BTW, I suspected that part of the problem could be caused by the hardware of 
the first node. So I ran another test over the weekend with the node replaced, 
and the result was slightly better: one of the nodes crashed after cca 22 hours 
when its DB reached 14G, but the other 3 nodes worked for 2.8 days until the DB 
reached 40G (see 
http://janevangelista.rajce.idnes.cz/nastenka/#4Riak\_2K\_2.1RC2\_3d\_edited.jpg ). 
All the nodes crashed silently, there is nothing interesting in Riak logs.

Thanks, Jan

Hi there, Jan,

The lsof issue is that max\_open\_files is per backend, iirc, so if
you're maxed out you'll see vnode count \* max\_open\_files.

I think on the second try, you may have set the cache too high. I'd
drop it back to 8 or 16 MB, and possibly up the open files a bit more,
but you don't seem to be running into contention at this point.
There's a RAM cost, so maybe just leave it where it is for now, unless
you have quite a lot of memory.

Another thing to check is that vm.swappiness is set to 0 and that your
disk scheduler is set to deadline for spinning disks and noop for
SSDs.
