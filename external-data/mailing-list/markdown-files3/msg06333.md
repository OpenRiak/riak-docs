Hello:

After reviewing a few options in the NoSQL space, I am considering using Riak 
for an e-commerce platform. I gather that atomicity (transactions) is not 
supported while durability can be enforced per request (using dw=1 or, at 
least, w=?). In other words, for most non-critical 
reads/writes, r/w can be optimized for availability while critical writes must 
be committed to disk (or to "enough" nodes?), sacrificing availability in the 
process.

Does this describe the state-of-affairs or am I missing something?
