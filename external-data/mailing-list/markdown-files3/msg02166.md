Hi,

The problem was not primarily that both processes ran on the same host,
but that the per process limits where to low for your load.
You would observe the same behaviour with Apache instead of Riak (maybe
the startup scripts of Apache in most distros increases the filehandle
limit, but lets just assume that is not the case :-) ).

Of course if you want to get realistic results from your load test, you
should run the clients on different hosts from the one riak is running
on in any case.

Cheers,
Nico
