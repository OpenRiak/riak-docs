Apologies for the delayed reply, was trying to export from riak 1.4.8. riak
2.0 would definitely address the ring size adjustment issue but I'd still
be curious as to best practices for moving data from one cluster to another
that may have different configs ie new default bucket properties and what
not. Thanks!
