I had similar experience on Centos while compiling from source. in my
understanding the problem was the erlang version (the centos shipped
version of erlang is not suitable, so I had to rebuild erlang from
source), and while building from source ssl libraries have to be
enabled. Also, if you're using released .tar.gz file, then you should
be building it with R13 (R14 won't work), SVN version of riak seems to
build with R14 version of erlang as well.

my .02 worth
