As to the SASL logging, unfortunately it's not "on by default" and the
setting in riak.conf, as you found out, doesn't work correctly. However,
you can enable SASL via adding a setting to your advanced.config:

{sasl,[{sasl\_error\_logger,tty}]} %% Enable TTY output for the SASL app
{sasl,[{sasl\_error\_logger,{file, "/path/to/log"}]} %% Enable SASL and
output to "/path/to/log" file

We're evaluating if we shouldn't just remove the sasl setting from
riak.conf altogether, as you're the first person (that we know of) since
2012 that has tried to turn it on and noticed this bug.
