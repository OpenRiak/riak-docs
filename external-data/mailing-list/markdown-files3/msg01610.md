Hi Jon,

Unfortunately, it is not possible to update just the metadata of the object;
updating the entire object is required. One possible alternative is to store
the metadata and body as two separate objects which would allow you to
update the metadata without resending the body.

Some initial thoughts related to this issue have been documented in bug 7:

Thanks,
Dan
