Hi Bryan,

Thanks, it makes sense, indeed, I've done what you've suggested, to load
the code within riak (using add\_paths) and everything worked fine. Still, I
have a couple dilemas regarding this:

1. Why is not complaining if using escript instead of compiling it as a
separate module (and no, I'm not loading the code within riak this time) ?

\*#!/usr/bin/env escript\*
\*
\*
\*main([]) ->\*
\* code:add\_patha("/Users/alin/riak-erlang-client/ebin"),\*
\* code:add\_patha("/Users/alin/riak-erlang-client/deps/protobuffs/ebin"),\*
\* {ok, Pid} = riakc\_pb\_socket:start\_link("127.0.0.1", 8087),\*
\* Fun = fun(Object, \_KeyData, none) -> [Object] end,\*
\* io:format("Result: ~n~p~n",[riakc\_pb\_socket:mapred(Pid,
{<<"test-bucket">>,[]}, [{map, {qfun, Fun}, none, true}])]).\*

this might be an erlang thing ?

2. I remember that running exactly the same code in the past (~ 1 month
ago), worked with no special intervention like adding code paths to riak.
In fact, that's why I've raised this problem now, as it doesn't make any
sense. Noticed this behavior on both release version (1.0.2) and master
branch from github.

Thanks,
Alin
