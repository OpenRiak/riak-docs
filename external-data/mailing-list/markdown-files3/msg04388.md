This is very helpful. Thank you.

We actually have two different key sizes, 9 key + 1 bucket = 10 total
And 11 key + 1 bucket = 12 total.

Sounds like both of those will get stored on a 64 byte boundary.

That puts us at ~80gb of expected usage. We're currently at 110gb.

Coming from the java world, I'm wondering if there are any intermediate
objects that need to be collected?

It sounds like you're generally saying that "it is what it is" for now and
just capacity plan around it.

thanks again,
Jacques
