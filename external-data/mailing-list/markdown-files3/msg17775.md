I found a similar question from over a year ago (
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2015-July/017327.html),
and it sounds like leveldb is the way to go, although possibly not well
tested. Has anything changed with regard to Basho's (or anyone else)
experience with using leveldb backend instead of the mutli backend for CS?
