Hey,
I am writing an application with the Java Client. I would like to
implement a scan through a various numbers of keys. I already figured
out two ways to do that. Using Links ( I don't have any) and using the
listKey-Method on a bucket to get all the keys, which is very
expensive. So I wondered if you know a possible third way to get
random keys?

Thank you in advance.
Cheers,
Maria
