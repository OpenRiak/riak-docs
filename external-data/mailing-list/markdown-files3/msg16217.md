c: +1 617.817.3195 Here's The Recap up to the end of May:

## Honest aside
The deltas on recaps are getting a little long this time of year with
all the conferences. I'm working on getting back down to minimum of 1
every 2 weeks.

## Bringing back Community Release Notes
Have you brought Riak into production at a new place?
Did you find a blog or presentation helpful?
Good! Share it in our release notes. This is important enough to link
out of order:

due thanks and other notes [11]. Please add whatever is missing!
