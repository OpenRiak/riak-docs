I've been looking at switching my Ruby interactions with Riak to Ripple and was 
trying to figure out how conflict resolution works. I saw one post saying it 
was targeted for 1.0 and some code for it in the master branch on github, but 
not documentation. Is there some that I've missed I could reference?

Thanks,
jl
