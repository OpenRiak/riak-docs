Don't use that. It's internal to Riak. Never never use /internal\_solr. Use the 
/solr interface exposed by Riak, and defined in the documentation.
Take care,
Eric

Hi Eric,

I'm using the internal\_solr web front end right now, port 8093
On this particular example, I have just one Riak node running locally - version 
2.0.1 - I haven't tested this on a multi node Riak install yet.

Your response header should contain shard and many filter values. What URL are 
you using to search with? Does it begin with /solr or /solr\_internal? What 
port? How many Riak nodes are you running? And what version do you have 
installed?

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Eric,

I don't get multiple siblings on a Riak GET for the key.

My buckets currently have allow\_mult: false and last\_write\_wins: true
The n\_val is the default 3

When I search, an example return is as follows, I can see the \_yz\_id has a 
unique number on the end alright though?

Thanks for the help!

Jason

You can check if your object has siblings by performing a key get, and see if 
two values return. If not, then it may be the index. Can you paste the response 
where you get two values?
