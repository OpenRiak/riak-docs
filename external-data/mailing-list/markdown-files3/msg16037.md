Hi,

Generally speaking, 48/64GB RAM with 20TB storage is enough strong for
typical usage of Riak CS, like yours. I would like to mention that too
large disk size per node with narrow bandwidth may lead to less
availability - time to recover degraded replicas in case of node/disk
failure may take longer (because larger disk means longer time to
recover). That should not be longer than MTBF. To ensure the
availability, please make sure you have 5 nodes or more.
