This was due to the UpdateValueFuture not checking for the exception
when the get() methods were called. Just fixed this, it'll be in the
very-soon-to-be-cut 2.0.1 release.

https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/pull/503

Sync calls are just a wrapper around the async call that calls get() -
You can currently work around this by calling UpdateValue async:

RiakFuture future =
Riakclient.executeAsync(updateOp);

future.await();
if (future.isSuccess()) {
 ...
} else {
 ...
}

Thanks,
