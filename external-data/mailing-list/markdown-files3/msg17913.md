I think the challenge in this case is to do it in an efficient manner.

I pretty much like the Big Data patterns presented at the last re:Invent.

(slide 45)

I think Riak TS can play a key role in the "store" phase, Spark connector
bridges one of the gaps to "process/analyze" phase. Nevertheless there are
plenty of other "process/analyze" options beyond Spark. This includes BI
tools, machine learning tools, data warehouse tools and so on.

Many players in the market have invested heavily bridging this gap. See BI
connectors and export for Mongo (
https://www.mongodb.com/products/bi-connector,
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoexport/). Kinesis
firehose from AWS (
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-kinesis-firehose-simple-highly-scalable-data-ingestion/
).

What're having to do in Riak TS is developing applications to export the
data and setting up some cron jobs and monitoring in place.
