Hello List,

So I am using apache on ubuntu as a reverse proxy to a riak cluster. Everything 
seems to work fine except for largish streaming map reduce queries. The config 
is:

 ServerAdmin aper...@acompany.com
 
 BalancerMember http://:8098
 BalancerMember http://:8098
 BalancerMember http://:8098
 BalancerMember http://:8098
 BalancerMember http://:8098
 BalancerMember http://:8098
 BalancerMember http://:8098
 

 ProxyPass balancer://riak\_cluster/
 ProxyPassReverse balancer://riak\_cluster/
 


What happens is that my streamed queries seem to partially come in which makes 
me think that the load balancer is switching them or something. I know I am 
missing some config value in here but I cannot, for the life of me, figure out 
what it is. Does anyone have an example config they could through up?
