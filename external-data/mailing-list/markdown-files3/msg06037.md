It seems like every week or so someone asks why list\_keys is slow or why
they can't delete a bucket. Is it impossible at this point to make buckets
their own keyspace or was that the original intention? Sort of confused by
the entire bucket notion at this point as prefixing my own keys is simple
enough.
