Hi,

 I was working on a supervisor and connection pool for some
riak-erlang-client connections, and noticed that the terminate/2
is empty. Is there a reason terminate/2 isn't the opposite of
init/1 as specified in the gen\_server documentation? (ie, the
init function actually connects, while the terminate does nothing,
when I would expect it to disconnect). I think what must happen
now if a supervisor terminates a riakc\_pb\_socket it will signal it
via exit, which would cause the gen\_server to call terminate/2,
but it seems like you still have an open connection at that point.

 Anyway, mostly curious if there was a reason before I look into
patching my fork.

-Anthony
