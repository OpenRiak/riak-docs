Riak Recap for March 28 - 31
=====================

1) Joseph Blomstedt's Erlang Factory Slides are online. His talk was
called, "Test First Construction of Distributed Systems" and is a great
look at some of the approaches he and others at Basho take to writing and
testing the code that make up Riak's internals.

2) More from Erlang Factory: Jesse Newland gave an exceptional talk about
how he and a few others are rewriting GitHub Pages using Riak and
Webmachine.
