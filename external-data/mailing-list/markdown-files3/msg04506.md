Vicky,

As long as that counter is not stored in Riak, there's nothing that would
prevent you from doing this. However, Riak does not provide a "range scan"
or "multi-fetch" type of operation, you will need to implement that
yourself. Also keep in mind that on any system, fetching 500,000 values at
once is going to be painful.
