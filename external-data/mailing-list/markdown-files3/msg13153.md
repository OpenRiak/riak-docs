This same thing is happening to me, where both $bucket index and my own custom 
indexes are returning keys that have been deleted and I canâ€™t remove them.
I am hoping there is a way to fix this as it is causing significant problems 
for us in production. It seems to be happening with some frequency, and every 
once in a while an index will just go bad completely and either return subsets 
of what it should return (even with a healthy cluster), or keys that have been 
deleted.

I had a case yesterday where $bucket was returning 6 keys that my custom 
all-inclusive index wasnâ€™t returning. They all produced 404s when I tried to 
retrieve a value. I was hoping read repair would repair the index when a 404 
occurred, or at least AAE might pick it up, but as it stands now, is there any 
way corrupted indexes like this can ever get back to normal?
