Brett,

My whole code was written for python-client 1.5.x . If I use
python-client 2.0.x it causes problem as there are api changes in 2.0 .
Can I get fix for httplib.BadStatusLine for python-client 1.5.x . will
we get next python-client 1.5.x release?
What do you suggest, my production uses python-client 1.5.x .
