I use riakc vsn=1.2.0.
The same as I used for riak 0.14
Thats the current "master" branch on github.

Is that the right version for riak 0.14 ?
Is that the right version for riak 1.0 ?

NOTE - this client can connect to both 0.14 and 1.0.
But on 0.14 the get with the argument deletedvclock disconnects.

Hi roland,

I think there were some protocol changes from 0.14 to 1.0, and so the new 
client probably can't be connected to an old server. Kind of annoying, but 
that's the only reason I can see for this.
