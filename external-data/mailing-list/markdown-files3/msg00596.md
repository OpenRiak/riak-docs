so im performing a rolling upgrade from 0.10 to 0.11 and have found a
problem with the transition document found here
http://hg.basho.com/riak/raw/efc290fd9c23/TRANSITION

long story short, section 1.2.2 says i need to run "riak-admin leave" but
this is not an option for me.
the release notes for 0.11 say "142 - riak-admin leave restored" which im
guessing means that 0.10 isn't supposed to have that functionality

so because im using innostore at the moment, i figure i can update to v0.11
without changing any config files and then when the node is at the correct
version i can then hit the "riak-admin leave" button, switch the backend
over to bitcask and then rejoin the cluster.

does that sound correct?

cheers,
gareth stokes
