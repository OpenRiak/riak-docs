Hi all,



While testing a simple go / protobuf driver I encountered
following behaviour:

After deleting an object and creating a new one with the same
key immediately afterwards Riak creates a sibling of the new
object. Trying to fetch an object with the key directly before
creating the new one fails.



If the timespan between delete and create is greater than ~3
seconds everything works as expected.



Is this behaviour documented somewhere? Does the required
minimal timespan depend on the cluster setup or is it
configurable?

I'm currently using Riak v2.0.0 on OS X locally, allow\_mult is
set to true.



Best regards,

Tilo Soenke
