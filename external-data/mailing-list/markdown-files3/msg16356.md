Hello,

I have been working in a extension to riak\_pb, but every time that I try to use 
my new message in my extension of riak\_erlang\_client I obtain this message:

"Socket error while sending riakc request: einval. Bad value on output port 
'tcp\_inet'”. 

I put this question in the channel of riak at https://webchat.freenode.net, 
but any answer. I also put replicate my error and put a post in GisHub with all 
the files:
https://gist.github.com/rhumbertgz/4881014e921572e7bca4  


Maybe I forgot to set some setting :(

Any suggestion?

Thanks in advance!
Humberto
