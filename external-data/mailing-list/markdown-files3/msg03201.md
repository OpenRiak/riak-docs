When you bring a cluster together using data copied from a different set of 
nodes you need to re-ip the first node you plan to start but you also have to 
change the ring manually on that node so when the subsequent nodes join 
everything works properly.

You can use DNS (public or private) or host file entries that reference the 
private IP of the node if you choose to use hostname.

We haven't outlined any best practices ourselves, but I tend to believe using a 
hostname that you can change the IP for via DNS or a hosts file is a more 
flexible way of approaching the problem.
