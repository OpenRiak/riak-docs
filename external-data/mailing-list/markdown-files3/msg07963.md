You did nothing wrong, this is a bug.There seems to be an issue with the start 
order of riak apps in master. I'm working on a fix (in fact, I have one, just 
need to raise the PR.)

Basically riak\_api is starting before riak\_core, but it depends on riak\_core 
for the stat cache. I've seen this with erlang r14b0\* but not with r15b0\*.

Will have a fix really soon.

Cheers
