I don't contribute to this list as much as I lurk in #riak (craque), but
it's really great to see this kind of community support somewhere,
especially at a large place that is heavily invested in riak itself.

I have considered posting some of the operational lessons I've learned over
the past five years on riak-based systems. If there will be an organized
effort around these types of things, I'm here to help and would love to be
involved as well.
