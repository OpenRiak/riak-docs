Hi Dmitri, this thread is old, but I read this part of your answer
carefully:

You can use the following strategies to prevent stale values, in increasing

I decided on strategy #2. What I am hoping for is some validation that the
code we use to "get", "put", and "delete" is correct in that context, or if
it could be simplified in some cases. Not we are using delete-mode
"immediate" and no duplicates.

In their shortest possible forms, here are the three methods I'd like some
feedback on (note, they're being used in production and haven't caused any
problems yet, however we have very few writes in production so the lack of
problems doesn't support the conclusion that the implementation is
correct.) Note all argument-checking, exception-handling, and logging
removed for clarity. \*I'm mostly concerned about correct use of causal
context and response.isNotFound and response.hasValues. \*Is there anything
I could/should have left out?

 public RiakClient(String name, com.basho.riak.client.api.RiakClient
client)
 {
 this.name = name;
 this.namespace = new Namespace(name);
 this.client = client;
 }

 public byte[] get(String key) throws ExecutionException,
InterruptedException {

 FetchValue.Response response = fetchValue(key);
 if (!response.isNotFound())
 {
 RiakObject riakObject = response.getValue(RiakObject.class);
 return riakObject.getValue().getValue();
 }
 return null;
 }

 public void put(String key, byte[] value) throws ExecutionException,
InterruptedException {

 // fetch in order to get the causal context
 FetchValue.Response response = fetchValue(key);
 RiakObject storeObject = new

RiakObject().setValue(BinaryValue.create(value)).setContentType("binary/octet-stream");
 StoreValue.Builder builder =
 new StoreValue.Builder(storeObject).withLocation(new
Location(namespace, key));
 if (response.getVectorClock() != null) {
 builder = builder.withVectorClock(response.getVectorClock());
 }
 StoreValue storeValue = builder.build();
 client.execute(storeValue);
 }

 public boolean delete(String key) throws ExecutionException,
InterruptedException {

 // fetch in order to get the causal context
 FetchValue.Response response = fetchValue(key);
 if (!response.isNotFound())
 {
 DeleteValue deleteValue = new DeleteValue.Builder(new
Location(namespace, key)).build();
 client.execute(deleteValue);
 }
 return !response.isNotFound() || !response.hasValues();
 }


Any comments much appreciated. I want to provide a minimally correct
example of simple client code somewhere (GitHub, blog post, something...)
so I don't want to post this without review.

Thanks,
