Following up on this issue from last October which bit me again with
1.1.1. Does anyone know why my deps/protobuffs/ebin/protobuffs.beam 
includes the function next\_field\_num function, but my
rel/riak/lib/protobuffs-0/ebin/protobuffs.beam (and 
dev/dev\*/riak/lib/protobuffs-0/ebin/protobuffs.beam) are smaller
and do not include the next\_field\_num function?
