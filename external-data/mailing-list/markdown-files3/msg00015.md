Thanks for the info. This is what I understood from the doc, the
examples and the tests I did. I was wondering if there was something I
was missing to be able to traverse a complete graph using a simple
call.

I don't know how the mapreduce link query is actually executed in the
mapreduce engine, if its distributed (i think not) but, AFAIK a
function cannot be defined, only patterns. Only the map and reduce
queries can have functions. Unless we can find a way to daisychain
mapreduce jobs for each link step? Otherwise, traversal can be done at
the application level I guess, requiring new mapreduce for each "next"
link.

But it would be really nice to be able to run a mapreduce job over a
complete graph defined with links.

Thanks,
Colin
