Dear list,

Does anyone have an opinion on the concept of putting a Riak cluster behind
a load balancer?

We wish to be able to automatically add/remove nodes from the cluster, so
adding an extra layer at the front is desirable. We should also benefit for
incoming requests behind shared across all nodes.

Can anyone see any drawbacks / problems with doing this?

Thanks
Matt
