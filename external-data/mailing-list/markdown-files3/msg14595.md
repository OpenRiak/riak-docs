Hi Guido

For Sydney hosting, I would recommend either Equinix or Global Switch. There 
is also another NextDC datacenter in Melbourne.

For larger installations, deal with the datacenters themselves. If you are 
looking for smaller installations, Servers Australia resells partial rack colo 
space. https://www.serversaustralia.com.au/colocation-servers-australia.php

I haven't personally used Servers Australia, so I can't vouch for them, but I 
have dealt with both Equinix and Global Switch, and the datacenters themselves 
are very impressive.

Hope this helps,
Jason

Hi Guido

How much are you looking to co-locate? Typically the best combo of service 
quality and value are in Sydney as there are more DCs down there (I'm in 
Brisbane) and most providers have their cores there as well. 

We co-Lo a full 42 RU rack in Brisbane for around $2400/month AUD but NextDC 
(in any of their facilities around the country) are closer to $1200/month with 
15A power (if I remember correctly) and you can buy more as you grow. 

NextDC tends to have tons of connectivity options to transit providers. Let me 
know if you'd like more info


Thanks
Dave
