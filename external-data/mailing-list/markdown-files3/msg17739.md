Hi,

When I try to simply test the throughput of Risk in the setting that
just start a single node and utilize two clients to issue requests, I
got connection refused after the client's thread of sending GET
request overcome about 400. Actually the server crashed. Why is it and
how can I fix?

Thanks
J.
