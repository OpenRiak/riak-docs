Hi all,

We led some tests with basho\_bench and we got some results here :
http://erralt.wordpress.com/2010/06/18/benching-riak-with-basho\_bench/

I put inside the pictures the content of each configuration file we used 
to launch the benchmarks (easier to compare).
When looking at the last benchmark and after 3000 seconds elapsed, can 
we considered that more than 2500 operations are done in one second ? On 
each second can we expect to get the same quantity of read and write 
requests throughout the benchmark ?


Regards,
Germain
