Hi Luna,

VNode puts and gets are registered each time a VNode performs an operation.
Any time a Node coordinates a client operation, there will be `n\_val` VNode
operations. However, not all VNode operations occur as a result of
client-side operations. In particular AAE tree rebuilds, AAE repairs and
realtime or fullsync MDC replication are counted at the VNode level, but
don't register at the node level.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
