Hi,

first, thank you for this nice piece of software, it really looks
carefully designed and that means a lot when it comes to data storage.

I'd have two questions regarding security :

 - does node communication is plain erlang node interprocesses
 communication as described in
 http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference\_manual/distributed.html#id2280311 ?
 So what is the correct way to allow nodes to join the ring, and how
 to encrypt data transfert ? Do you consider that Riak should stay
 away from that, and for example, rely on a VPN ?

 - do you plan to provide some kind of access control, at the
 bucket-level for example, with credentials or anything else ? Or do
 you consider that Riak should stay away from that, and rely on a http
 reverse proxy doing authentication and access control ?

regards
