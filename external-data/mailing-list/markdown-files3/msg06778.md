If you want to avoid overwhelming the cluster, there's an easy trick you can 
try.

In the RDBMS world, we frequently batch requests and issue 5,000 or 10,000 
updates at once. We then put a delay in the code of a second or so after the 
commit so that the transaction log has a second to catch up. This is really so 
that the checkpoint flushing dirty pages from memory doesn't run into I/O 
contention with the log writer.

Updating by time instead of key will have a double I/O hit for the lookup, but 
you can easily control the order of updates. I say go for it.
