Hi All,

With another RICON put to rest we're already busy scheming up how we can
improve the content and experience next year. In that vein, if you attended
RICON West in person or watched the talks over the live stream we'd greatly
appreciate your feedback.

We've created a survey [0] which shouldn't take more than 5 minutes of your
time to complete. Your input is important, and will help craft the future
of the RICON conference series. Please tell us what you liked, what you
loved and where we can do better.

Furthermore, we consolidated all 4 live stream feeds onto a single page
[1], where you can go watch/rewatch the talks while we edit the recordings
over the next few weeks. Enjoy.

Many thanks all; without you RICON would not be possible.

-Tom
