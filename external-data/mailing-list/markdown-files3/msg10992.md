Thanks Russell for quick reply

Regarding intermediate upgrade
I was under the impression that Riak upgrades are supported from one
version behind so 1.0 -> 1.1, 1.1 -> 1.2
1.2 -> 1.3.x are allowed but 1.1 -> 1.3 is not
Am I wrong here?
I could not find relevant info in Rolling Upgrades doc, I think I've read
it somewhere on mailing list.

Daniel
