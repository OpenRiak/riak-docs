Hey Alexander,

We find most people's needs are covered with Ansible, Puppet and Chef
for management purposes. I'm not sure if each of the cases you outline
are broken out as idempotent scripts you can run right this instant.

A recent curiosity of mine: I'd like to spin up environments using
Terraform from Hashicorp [1] since it supports both local and remote
deployments with ease.

Thinking through the other parts:

> run commands
I use ad hoc commands in Ansible for that

> Apply config
Any of the three of these

> Restart nodes
Same as running commands

> monitor clusters
Great question: I'm curious what others use here

> Audit all action
Another great question I'm not familiar with

> Collect logs
Another good question


I hope that gets this conversation started.
