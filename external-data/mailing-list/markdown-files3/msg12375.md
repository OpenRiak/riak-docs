I know it's a few extra steps, but I've had success using node.js and 
riak-js(http://riakjs.com) to debug MapReduce

I'm actually working on a new app called Refraction that will be a Futon 
(CouchDB) like interface for Riak. I hope to have that available as open source 
in the next few weeks.

There is also a thread started by Adron Hall on Github discussing similar needs
