Hi Bryan,

Yeah, 2.0.1 is an old one. I normally use 2.1.1 on my own developments but
this exact one was for an in-house company competition they run last august
so I was not able to touch the implementation until the competition was
over last month (of course, my solution kicked everybody's else asses and
won!... lol)

Is also funny that after months of testing and competition the indexes had
to crash exactly when the competition was over! I remember about all issues
with AAE so I first upgraded to 2.1.1 to see if it would be fixed but
continued crashing; so as final resort I decided to delete the AAE folders
and it was back to normal (so far it didn't crash again until now)

However I was wondering why happened; seems clear now! and good to know I
don't have to worry about it in future releases : )

Thanks again for your help!
Alex
