Dear All,
Just a brief update to say that rc6 packages are available for most of the 
usual operating systems at https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.9/2.9.0rc6/

I will restate that all the usual caveats apply. This is a release candidate 
intended for testing and non-production environments only. Please report any 
bugs found via GitHub https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0rc6

Best regards,

Nicholas

Subject: [ANN] Riak 2.9.0 - Release Candidate 6 Available


Release Candidate 6 for 2.9.0 is now available on github. It is available

to build from source here - https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0rc6.



Apologies for the churn of release candidates on 2.9.0. As part of the move to 
2.9 there has been a big update to the mochiweb/webmachine code, getting that 
more in line with current upstream - and this has thrown up some issues.



All usual caveats arise. This is a release intended for testing in

non-production environments.



Apologies for the ongoing delays getting this release through the test

process. I'm hopeful this will be the last candidate before we release 2.9.0.



Regards



Martin
