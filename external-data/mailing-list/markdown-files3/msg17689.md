Hello all -

I was wondering if it is possible to use RiakTS with a multi-backend 
configuration. 

I have an existing set of applications using RiakKV and Bitcask, but we're now 
wanting to start using some of the TS features on a new project. Setting up the 
multi-backend configuration with TS seems to work fine (our app existing app 
reads the Bitcask buckets and SOLR indices without issue), and we can even 
create a TS schema. We have LevelDB as the default backend, so presumably this 
is what was used during the "create table" query.

When trying to query the TS table, we're seeing:

2016-10-12 10:02:41.372 [error] <0.1410.0> gen\_fsm <0.1410.0> in state active 
terminated with reason: call to undefined function 
riak\_kv\_multi\_backend:range\_scan/4 from riak\_kv\_vnode:list/7 line 1875

And then in the client code, no return until finally an Exception (Riak Java 
Client).


Thanks for any assistance!
