If you want to perform some kind of ad hoc querying, your only real option is 
Map Reduce. Fun fact: you can perform Riak Search queries through Map Reduce.

You can also do this with HTPP requests for Riak Search or indexes (either HTTP 
or Protocol Buffers), but you'll probably end up doing something that looks 
like this:

Query objects from Riak Search
Collect relationship IDs from Riak Search results
Query objects from Riak or Riak Search by ID
Repeat

Depending on your application patterns, it's possible to save the complete 
object graph in Riak. Riak is ill-suited to ad hoc querying patterns like you 
can perform on an RDBMS.

A good pattern for this comes from orders. In an RDBMS you might have tables to 
define OrderHeaders, LineItems, Customers, and Addresses. With riak you could 
easily save this as an object graph that looks like this:

{ order\_header: { blah blah blah },
 line\_items: [],
 customer: { blah blah blah },
 shipping\_address: { blah blah blah },
 billing\_address: { blah blah blah }
}

Data modeling in Riak typically requires that you flatten your data model when 
you save it: optimize for reads, not writes. 

If you have a predictable key name format, you can use key filters to perform 
an in-memory query on key names before performing your MR queries on the 
results of the key filter. 

Without knowing more about what you're actually trying to accomplish, it's not 
possible to provide you with an accurate and detailed answer; I can only give 
you generalities and hand waving. It may be that you aren't able to give that 
info out on a mailing list, and I completely understand that.
