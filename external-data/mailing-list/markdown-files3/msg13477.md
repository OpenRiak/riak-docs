Ajit,

 Riak Search doesn't exactly support nested fields. The default extractor
will flatten the fields in the input by joining the field and subfield names
with underscore. (example below)

I'm not totally clear on what you are trying to accomplish, so I'll run
through an example and hope it clears up some confusion.

The data as pasted in the original email confuses the extractor since the
same fields are duplicated with the object:
```
root@sitea2:~# search-cmd install testbucket

 :: Installing Riak Search <--> KV hook on bucket 'testbucket'.

root@sitea2:~# curl http://sitea2:8098/buckets/testbucket/keys/emp1 -XPUT -H
"content-type: application/json" -d '

 }'

Adding them separately allows each to be indexed:


```
root@sitea2:~# curl http://sitea2:8098/buckets/testbucket/keys/emp1 -XPUT -H
"content-type: application/json" -d '{
"employee":{
 "employee\_name":"Raghav Maitra",
 "employee\_id":"1001",
 "designation":"Technical Analyst",
 "emp\_contract\_no":"1987-XXVI",
 "department":
 {"dept\_name":"ADW",
 "sub\_dept\_name":"A1",
 "dept\_id":"A1-2001",
 "dept\_description":"Analysis and Devlopement Wing",
 "dept\_site\_name":"Diego Gracia"
 },
 }
}'

root@sitea2:~# curl http://sitea2:8098/buckets/testbucket/keys/emp2 -XPUT -H
"content-type: application/json" -d '{
"employee":{
 "employee\_name":"Ajit",
 "employee\_id":"1002",
 "designation":"Technical Analyst",
 "emp\_contract\_no":"1987-XXVI",
 "department":
 {"dept\_name":"ADW",
 "sub\_dept\_name":"A1",
 "dept\_id":"A1-2001",
 "dept\_description":"Analysis and Devlopement Wing",
 "dept\_site\_name":"Diego Gracia"
 },
 }
}'
```


After these puts, the following terms exist in the search index:


```
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_department\_dept\_description">>,<<"Analysis"
>>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_department\_dept\_description">>,<<"and">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_department\_dept\_description">>,<<"Devlopeme
nt">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_department\_dept\_description">>,<<"Wing">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_department\_dept\_id">>,<<"A1-2001">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_department\_dept\_name">>,<<"ADW">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_department\_dept\_site\_name">>,<<"Diego">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_department\_dept\_site\_name">>,<<"Gracia">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_department\_sub\_dept\_name">>,<<"A1">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_designation">>,<<"Analyst">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_designation">>,<<"Technical">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_emp\_contract\_no">>,<<"1987-XXVI">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_employee\_id">>,<<"1001">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_employee\_id">>,<<"1002">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_employee\_name">>,<<"Ajit">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_employee\_name">>,<<"Maitra">>}}
 {{<<"testbucket">>,{<<"employee\_employee\_name">>,<<"Raghav">>}}
```

And search-cmd can query as expected:

```
root@sitea2:~# search-cmd search testbucket
employee\_department\_dept\_id:A1-2001

 :: Searching for 'employee\_department\_dept\_id:A1-2001' / '' in

Subject: Search is not working in RIAK

Hi,
Search doesnÂ¹t seem to work on a normal JSON file. Have created index on
JSON file and installed the search on the bucket also.
$search-cmd search out2\_buk "employee\_name:\"Ajit\""
:: Searching for 'employee\_name:"Ajit"' / '' in out2\_buk...
------------------------------
:: Found 0 results.
 
File content is pasted below :
"employee":{
 "employee\_name":"Raghav Maitra",

 "emp\_contract\_no":"1987-XXVI",
 "department":
 {"dept\_name":"ADW",
 "sub\_dept\_name":"A1",
 "dept\_id":"A1-2001",
 "dept\_description":"Analysis and Devlopement Wing",
 "dept\_site\_name":"Diego Gracia"
 }
 "employee\_name":"Ajit",
