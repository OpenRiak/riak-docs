Hi Andre,

The blocks are going to be spread across some subset of that 100 servers.
Since Riak CS stores the chunks inside Riak they are hashed based on
primary key. Currently there is no way to co-locate chunks in Riak CS. You
can read more about How riak manages storage here:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/theory/concepts/Clusters/let

While it is possible to change the n\_val (number of times an object is
replicated) on buckets inside Riak, it is not easy or advisable to do so
with Riak CS. Additionally, even if Riak CS allowed you to set the n\_val
for individual CS buckets Riak itself does not support changing the n\_nval.
Riak CS generates block keys and prefixes bucket names, and is generally in
charge of how it chunks and stores your data inside Riak.

-Andrew
