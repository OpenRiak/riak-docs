We have a 5 node cluster running 2.0.0beta1. Our 2i indexes seem to return
different responses depending on which node you hit, so I'm trying to
rebuild them.

I'm trying to run riak-admin repair-2i and it fails with Error:
index\_scan\_timeout

An example:
# riak-admin repair-2i 0
Will repair 2i on these partitions:
0
Watch the logs for 2i repair progress reports

I found a previous post about this:
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2014-August/015655.html

I tried to set the aae\_2i\_batch\_size, 10 in the advanced.conf, the server
started, but I'm not sure how to confirm this setting took.
If it did take It didn't seem to help.

Any other suggestions?
Let me know if you need more details.
