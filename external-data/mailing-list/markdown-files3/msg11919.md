Deyan,

What Riak version are you running? There was a corruption issue discovered
and fixed in the 1.4.0 release.

https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/riak-1.4.0/RELEASE-NOTES.md#issues--prs-resolved
https://github.com/basho/merge\_index/pull/30

As for fixing, you'll want to delete the buffer files for the partitions
which are having issues. E.g. if you look in crash.log you'll see
partition numbers for the crashing vnodes.

> \*\* Data ==
{state,685078892498860742907977265335757665463718379520,riak\_search\_vnode,undefined,undefined,none,undefined,undefined,undefined,undefined,0}

In the
/storage/riak/merge\_index/685078892498860742907977265335757665463718379520
you'll see buffer files. You'll want to delete those. After deleting all
these bad buffers Riak Search should start fine. You'll then want to
upgrade to 1.4.1 to avoid corruption in the future. Finally, since you
have to delete the buffers you'll have missing indexes and you'll want to
re-index your data.

Since only one of your nodes experience corruption you can use the built-in
repair functionality to re-index only data for those partitions. First
you'll want to attach to one of your nodes. Then for each partition run
the following.

> riak\_search\_vnode:repair(P)

Make sure to run repair for only one partition at a time to avoid
overloading anything.

To determine when a repair is finished you can periodically call the
following. Once it returns 'no\_repair' that indicates it has finished.

> riak\_search\_vnode:repair\_status(P)

Here is more information on the repair command.
