Hi everyone,

I am new to NOSQL and have chosen RIAK for my application. I am using \*
Riak-Java-Client\*.
I have already created the schema to use but, I am having a few doubts to
start with the next step.
\*
for ex.\*

 - I need to update values of keys in a bucket. Values are JSON objects.
 Do I have to query the whole JSON object to update a field in it.
 - Also what are the methods for implementing \*where\* clause in it.

I didn't found much \*examples with codes written in JAVA.\*\* \*If someone
knows any sources for the same please let me know.

Thank you.
