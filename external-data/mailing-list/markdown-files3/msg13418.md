Hi All,

I am using Amazon's S3 SDK to upload a file to RiakCS. The use case is to
upload a file from browser. I have noticed that MultiPartUpload API needs
Content-Length before starting upload to RiakCS. So, I am first uploading a
file to Webserver's disk and then uploading the file to Riak CS. Is there
anyway I can skip the additional step of uploading the file to disk and
directly stream to Riak CS? Any help is appreciated.
