I'm going to take a punt that you're using the wrong domain name.
Eg. you've told riak to use, say, s3.internal as the base, but you're
actually sending queries to s3.example.com (or if you are using
default settings on some tools, s3.amazonaws.com)

If you're using a reverse proxy in front, check that you're passing
the Host: header back.

The falcon cannot hear the falconer
Things fall apart; the center cannot hold
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world
