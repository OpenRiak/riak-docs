Hi,
The other day I was concerned when I discovered the riak-cs console.log
contained the following:
```
2016-11-17 16:36:10.639 [warning]
<0.155.0>@riak\_cs\_app:check\_admin\_creds:76 The admin user's secret is
specified. Ignoring.
2016-11-17 16:36:10.680 [info]
<0.155.0>@riak\_cs\_app:fetch\_and\_cache\_admin\_creds:93 setting admin secret
as XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX==
```

Except that the long string of XXXXXX was our real admin secret!

I saw the warning in the previous line, and wondered if perhaps something
had changed, and we shouldn't be specifying the admin details any longer?

But according to this, yes we should:
https://docs.basho.com/riak/cs/2.1.1/cookbooks/configuration/riak-cs/#specifying-the-admin-user

So.. what's the deal? What is this warning message about, and how can we
stop it logging out secret keys?

Cheers
Toby
