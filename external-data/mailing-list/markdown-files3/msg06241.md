Yes, but it makes it unusable for anything that requires atomic
operations. A group here just went with elasticsearch - partly
because of the full lucene indexer and range queries, but mostly
because they wanted redundant data feeds and an atomic operation to
reject duplicates. And as a nice side effect, you can run a
client-only node that doesn't store data on the same box with the
application so you don't need to go through a separate load balancer
to deal with failures of the node the app is configured to use.
