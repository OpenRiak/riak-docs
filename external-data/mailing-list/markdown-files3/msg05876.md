Hi everyone,
A kind of silly question perhaps but here we go.
I am following the tutorials at the basho site and when I get to the part
where I want to add Links to the metadata in the object , I am having some
difficulties with the binary <<"Links">>.
When you create a riakc\_object is that particular binary(<<"Links">>) there
automatically or does it have to be inserted?
I am trying to create functions that insert the value(<<"Links">>,[]) in
the object after it has been created but it doesn't feel right.
Why I am mostly confused is that if you use dict:fetch or dict:find on an
object without any links it throws an exception which I can't handle in a
case statement.

Please let me know if anything is unclear and I would appreciate any
feedback.

Kind Regards,
Can
