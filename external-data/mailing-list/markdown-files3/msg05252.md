Thanks for the pointers guys:

@eric - Am not sure the python library lets me do that - looking at the docs
and playing with the object this morning. I probably can't query by that
header at a later stage though can I?

@siculars - Thanks for that - I think that's the option I'm going to go for
- is it a bit weird to be creating another set that just holds pointers to
another object for the sake of a date? Is there a more "riakful" way of
achieving what I'm setting out to do?

Cheers
Andrew
