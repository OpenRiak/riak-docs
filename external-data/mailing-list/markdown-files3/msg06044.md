Nice!

I had actually done the same thing using DrSlump's protobuf library and
found that it worked quite well and was about 40% faster than HTTP.

I'm curious what your results might be performance-wise comparing what you
have written to DrSlumps (I noticed there is a commit comment about
comparing to DrSlumps).
