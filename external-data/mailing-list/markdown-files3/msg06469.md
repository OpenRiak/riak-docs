As I understand, overhead of Erlangs' fully connected node network is in
TCP pings or heartbeats that nodes send to each other. Each node pings
every other node that it is connected to. So that ping overhead grows
quadratically with node count.

Frequency of those heartbeats can be set with -kernel net\_ticktime
parameter.

I wonder did you tweak that parameter in some way with Riak? Perhaps some
other tweaks?

Sharas
