Five is the minimum number of nodes required to guarantee each copy of each 
object is not stored on the same physical machine. With three this can not be 
guaranteed, so you might have two copies (out of three) for a given object on 
the same machine.

It’s an optimization problem computed during node membership referred to as 
“claim.”
