Riak Recap for March 30 - 31

this position)

\* ---> http://www.idealab.com/about\_idealab/position/Data\_Engineer

2) Q --- Anyone experienced using #riak as a #linkeddata store? URI
naming scheme & linking seems perfectly suit. (from @jonzo1 via
twitter)

 A --- Check oiut http://ow.ly/4rclW and http://ow.ly/4rcnN Both
show #riak as a store for semweb-like stuff. (h/t to @seancribbs)

3) seancribbs and TB123 had a quick chat about benchmarking with basho\_bench.

\* Gist here ---> https://gist.github.com/899066

4) roidrage, seancribbs and beat had a convo in #riak that started
with, "is it possible to link walk on a defined set of keys? Without
doing iteration over the keys on the application-side?"

\* Resulting Gist here ---> https://gist.github.com/899074

5) By all accounts the inaugural Riak Meetup in Stockholm was a huge hit.

\* @martengustafson posted the slides from the meetup here --->

\* He is also looking for suggestions on date and location for the next
meetup from interested parties --->

Thanks again to Marten and the rest of the organizers for putting on
this event. Looking forward to seeing it flourish!
