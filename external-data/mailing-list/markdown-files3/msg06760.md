Hi,
I'm preparing a talk on conflict/sibling resolution, and I was hoping to gather 
some real world examples.

Most people know the shopping cart example from the dynamo paper, but not \*all\* 
Riak apps are shopping carts.

If you can provide any information about how you resolve siblings, and what you 
might have learnt along the way, I'd really appreciate it. If you want to 
provide information off list that's cool too.

Cheers

Russell
