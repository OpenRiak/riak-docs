Howdy Alex!

It's not ludicrous at all since changes in Riak 2.0 should reduce that
overhead to about 13 bytes per key, IIRC.

In these situations, you could always use an external identity generation
process. Here's where I plug Rustflakes [1] which can generate unsigned
64-bit, decimal, or BigInteger numbers based on a combination of time since
an epoch, a machine identifier, and an internally cycling identifier that
resets every millisecond.

I can't lay claim to the idea, but I can lay claim to writing parts of it
in C#.
