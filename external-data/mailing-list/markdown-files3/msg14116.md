Hi guys!

I searched the docs and the source code but wasn't able to find any info
about using edismax.

I have 2 questions:

1. How to set edismax parser?

2. Why are "start" and "rows" not working properly?

I have 4 records in riak bucket:

 B
 C
 A
 D


{sort, <<"field asc">>} returns correctly sorted records (A,B,C,D).

But [{sort, <<"field asc">>},{start,0},{rows,2}] is returning (C,D) while
I'm expecting (A,B).

Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Any hints?


Thanks,
-- Buriwoy
