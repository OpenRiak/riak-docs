Hi Sargun,

I installed it from source on Ubuntu14.04 LTS.

I'll take a look at kerl as well; right now this issue more academic 
than anything else.


Sincerely,

Robert

How did you install OTP18? When dealing with Erlang, and multiple
installs of it, I might suggest using kerl
(https://github.com/kerl/kerl). It's an excellent tool for dealing
with the problem.

Hi all,

Quick question:

I have an instance with OTP18 and I want to make it a Riak Node. I
DL/install the OTP16 patch 8 for Riak 2.1.4. How then do I use make rel to
use OTP16 instead of the default OTP18??


Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

Robert
