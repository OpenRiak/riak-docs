This is only an idea:

You could mark your related objects with a 2i, when you need them 
retrieve the list of IDs from that 2i, fetch them concurrently into some 
local memory cache, and then navigate through your object graph by 
fetching them one by one from your local cache. It will be hard to find 
something that beats fetching the keys concurrently.

Hello guys,

I have some question about using a links.
In our data model each object A has a lot of links to other objects and we are 
doing a lot of queries to fetch all objects that linked with A.
Could it be a performance issue?
Will it be more faster to store list of ids of related objects and fetch them 
by ids?

Thank you.
