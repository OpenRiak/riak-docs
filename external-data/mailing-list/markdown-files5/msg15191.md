Hi,

Can anyone please suggest what will be the best setup of Yokozuna (I mean
indexing/search performance) if I have many buckets of the same bucket-type:

1. having 1 yokozuna index associated with a bucket-type (e.g. with all
buckets)
2. having separate yokozuna index created and associated with each bucket

In my setup I will always have to search within a single (specified) bucket
only so that search results from other buckets do not mix together.

Thanks!
