Hey guys,

 

I've found that with CouchDB an interface like Futon is extremely
helpful. I understand that Riak Control was going to have
object-browsing features, but they have been pushed-back and/or
abandoned. Is there a data browser out there that is easy to use and
provides features similar to Futon? I've looked at Rekon, and it just
isn't very useful IMO.

 

Any pointers would be appreciated.

 

Thanks,
