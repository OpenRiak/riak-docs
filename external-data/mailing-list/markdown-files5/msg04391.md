This begs the question, is there much efficiency to gain by creating a true
multi-get? It seems like a number of people are trying to get the most
efficient multi-get possible.

If I remember, it was closed as a wontfix a couple years ago. Did you guys
at Basho find that it just didn't have that much impact on performance?

Thanks,
Jacques

&gt; As Matt and Jacques noted, M/R is really not intended to be used in
&gt; this manner (i.e. for multi-get), particularly if you're interested in
&gt; latency. Generally, you will wind up involving more nodes on a M/R
&gt; request and shipping the "get" results across those nodes as the
&gt; system tries to distribute M/R.
