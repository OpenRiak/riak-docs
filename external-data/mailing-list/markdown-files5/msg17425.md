reiterating my last email

&gt; theres no guarantee vnodes are assigned to unique servers..

referencing the docs

&gt; Nodes \\*attempt\\* to claim their partitions at intervals around the ring
such that there is an even distribution amongst the member nodes and that
no node is responsible for more than one replica of a key.

&gt; the third is on a second node. That runs contrary to my understanding (link
&gt; here: http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/learn/concepts/clusters/) that
&gt; the data is spread out across partitions in such a way that the partitions
&gt; are on different servers. Is there something I'm missing here please in
&gt; terms of how Riak works? Thanks...
