Riak 0.10 Release Notes
-----------------------

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading an earlier version of Riak, please read
 the TRANSITION file in the directory above this
 (http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/src/55a7f83c2ae2/TRANSITION)

Riak 0.10 brings many new features and improvements.

In addition to the existing HTTP interface, Riak 0.10 exposes a
protocol buffers interface. This interface allows for basic put/get
operations, and has client libraries in Python and Erlang. Support
for map/reduce operations, and additional language libraries will be
added soon. Read more about the interface on the wiki:
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/PBC+API

Riak 0.10 exposes the ability to tie into an object's update
lifecycle, via pre-commit and post-commit hooks. Hook functions can
be implemented in Erlang or Javascript. More detail on the wiki:
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Pre-+and+Post-Commit+Hooks

Listing the keys stored in a bucket is faster an more reliable in 0.10.

The "eventer" subsystem has been removed from Riak. It was found to
be a bottleneck, as well as the main source of non-modularity in the
code. This should not affect client code, unless it was explicitly
calling 'riak\\_eventer:add\\_handler' function.

Chunks of Riak have been rearranged for cleanliness and modularity.
If you are upgrading an existing cluster to 0.10, please carefully
read and follow the instructions in the TRANSITION file, referenced at
the top of these release notes. Some filenames and app.config
settings have changed, which you will want to account for in your
installation.

Erlang applications that Riak depends on (webmachine, erlang\\_js, etc.)
have been moved out of the Riak repository, and into their own
repositories. If you install a prebuilt Riak, this change will not
affect you. If you build Riak from the source tarball, this change
will not affect you. If you build Riak by cloning from the Bitbucket
repository, your first "make" will download the additional source
needed from Bitbucket.

Client libraries have been moved into their own repositories. Instead
of finding them under the client\\_lib subdirectory, please visit the
appropriate repo:
 - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-javascript-client
 - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-python-client
 - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-ruby-client
 (same as) http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/
 - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-java-client
 - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-php-client
 - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-erlang-client
 (using protocol buffers instead of distributed Erlang)

Riak 0.10 also includes a number of minor improvements and bug fixes:
 - multipart/mixed responses from the HTTP interface now use proper
 line termination (\\r\\n, instead of just \\n)
 - fixed the "fold" functionality (used during handoff) for the
 multi-backend.
 - improvements to gossip corner cases
 - improvements to shell scripts for cross-platform compatibility
 - improvements for running map/reduce jobs on a degraded cluster
