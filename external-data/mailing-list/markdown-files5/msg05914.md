Greetings, all.

I was combing Bugzilla and release notes this weekend to find out whether the 
search-indices-not-so-fault-tolerant has been fixed yet. Nothing I found seemed 
to match exactly. Is the issue still present?

If so I think I'll go open a bug for itâ€”I just didn't want to create a 
duplicate if it's already been done.

Thanks much,

-Markus S

&gt; 1. For performance reasons Search only ever reads from 1 node (R=1)

&gt; I realize this sucks and isn't in line with Riak's more fault tolerant 
&gt; behavior. It does suck. I hate the fact that I have to write this email 
&gt; basically telling you this part of Search is broken, IMO. I want to see it 
&gt; addressed and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Right now our internal ticket 
&gt; board is buzzing in anticipation for the new release. After that there is a 
&gt; lot of love I want to give Search, this particular issue included. I'd say 
&gt; it's only a matter of time.
