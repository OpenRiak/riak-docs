Suppose I have come to the conclusion each of my LevelDB backed Riak nodes 
needs to hold 2TB of data. 

Also suppose I have the ability to store data on more expensive SSD drives, and 
less expensive magnetic drives. 

My question: What should leveldb.tiered be set to in /etc/riak/riak.conf? 

I know from the LevelDB docs on the Basho Riak site 
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/), each level 
holds 10x the data the level above it holds, starting at level 1 with 10MB. 

If this is correct, the data capacities of each level should be: 

Level 1: 10MB 
Level 2: 100 MB 
Level 3: 1 GB 
Level 4: 10 GB 
Level 5: 100 GB 
Level 6: 1 TB 

If this is this case, I would assume using leveldb.tiered = 5 (100GB) or 
leveldb.tiered = 6 (1 TB) of SSD capacity needed. The remainder (either 1.9 TB 
or 1 TB) will be stored on the magnetic drives on a different mount point. 

Am I reasoning this out correctly? 

If so, will my SSD drives ever \\*exceed\\* 100GB or 1TB of data? Not that I'd just 
it that close, anyway....
