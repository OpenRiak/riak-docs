How so? My understanding is that Lucene's index looks pretty much like a
LSM-tree, and that any delete (instead of an index drop), will result in
the writing a of a tombstone into a new segment, which eventually will have
to merged. So a delete is as costly as a write plus the attendant costs of
merging.

Even if that is solved, Riak Search will have other tradeoffs such
&gt; as substantially reduced feature support compared to Yokozuna as well as
&gt; reduced performance for many types of queries. But I do agree many indexes
&gt; (thus cores) could pose a problem for Yokozuna.

Agreed. I think Yokozuna is a great step forward and I am looking forward
to it. I just wanted to point out this scaling limitation that results
from the every index on every node architecture.
