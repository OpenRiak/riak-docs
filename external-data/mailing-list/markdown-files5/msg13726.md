Overloaded cluster and get/puts timing out due to this.

We got nailed by this earlier this week.

We now have some corrupt bitcask files and merge issues we are trying to sort 
out. My suspicions they are somehow related to 1.4.8 and/or the AAE overload. 
We did not have issues with 1.4.7 or prior in many many months of smooth Riak 
operation.

That extension to the read me file over deleting the AAE trees prior would have 
been nice to know prior.

&gt; On the Release notes, theres a new section recommending the deletion of all
&gt; previous AAE info before upgrading to 1.4.8.
&gt; 
&gt; What are the risks (if any) of not doing this (the deletion) beside the
&gt; wasting resources?
