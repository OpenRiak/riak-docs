Hi,

TL:DR - https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak/tree/rdb/nhs-riak-2.2.5 is the 
fork/branch that I’ve been making progress on.

&gt;From my understanding of what we discussed, or at least my view: in order that 
&gt;we generate momentum and show signs of life, the best thing to do is release a 
&gt;new Riak, but a low risk Riak. Based on that, we (NHS) thought take the last 
&gt;known good release (riak-2.2.3) and branch of that. Use it as a basis for some 
&gt;low risk features/fixes and release it soon. The aim was this year, or at 
&gt;latest January 2018. That release would contain some NHS features, a fix for 
&gt;claim, G-Sets, and maybe some AAE fullsync repl fixes. I have been working on 
&gt;the NHS fork for this for a while. My initial aim has been so that a developer 
&gt;can clone Riak, and run `make test`, and it will pass. Next is to make 
&gt;riak-test pass. Set up CI. Then add in the new features already fixed, and 
&gt;finally build and release. Then there should be a reasonably low-risk, 
&gt;community Riak-2.2.5 for us to deploy. After, we build on that for the more 
&gt;risky work (OTP20, etc etc.)

The fork I’ve been working off is https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak. The branch 
that one should be able to build is nhs-riak-2.2.5 
(https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak/tree/rdb/nhs-riak-2.2.5). Cloning 
https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak.git and then `git checkout nhs-riak-2.2.5` and 
then `make test` should work. Though I have one or two test failures still on 
linux (not on OS X afaict.)

Each of the deps that I had to change in order to get the build working is also 
forked in the https://github.com/nhs-riak/ organisation. Each dependancy's 
branch is named after the last released tag + “nhs-2.2.5”. For example, 
https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak\\_kv has branch 2.1.7-nhs-2.2.5 (since 2.1.7 was 
the last released tag.) When it all works the plan was to push each new branch 
to the canonical basho organisation and name it develop-2.2.5 (or something) 
and from there we can work towards the next release (and the one after, maybe a 
develop-3.0 branch based off 2.2.5.) We also sidestep the issue of reviewing 
and fixing up all of the basho unreleased dev code, which we can cherry-pick as 
we need.

I don’t know if this is the best idea, but it seems like a pragmatic approach 
to building momentum and getting something of value released, as well as 
setting us up for longer term improvements.

It is sort of what we agreed at the meet-up, but I’d love to hear views from 
the wider community.

Cheers

Russell

&gt; Hi Andrew, all,
&gt; IIRC, we have mentioned an important step to bootstrap the community is to 
&gt; identify baselines.
&gt; Can anyone confirm that contributions should be based on NHS branch (which 
&gt; one ?) ? In particular, I'm interested in contributing to OTP19/20 upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, I've mentioned OW2 organization would be glad to provide the 
&gt; community with infrastructure: gitlab, CI (tools + servers), etc.
&gt; Are you interested in it ? Just let me know if it is the case or have a look 
&gt; at the project submission 
&gt; page:https://projects.ow2.org/bin/view/wiki/submission#
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; Jean
