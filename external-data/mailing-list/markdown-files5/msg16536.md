Hi,

Please read the following configuration of /etc/riak-cs/riak-cs.conf:

listener = 10.0.2.10:8080
riak\\_host = 10.0.2.10:8087
stanchion\\_host = 10.0.2.10:8085

as:

listener = 0.0.0.0:8080
riak\\_host = 10.0.2.10:8087
stanchion\\_host = 10.0.2.10:8085

This quick fix will have Riak CS listen on all interfaces and allow you to
continue with its installation.

I'll work with the documentation team to have this fix considered ASAP.
This issue is now tracked at https://github.com/basho/basho\\_docs/issues/1830


Thank you,
Ciprian

&gt; Is there a different set of documentation out there for installing,
&gt; primarily
&gt; configuring RIAK-CS, RIAK, and Stanchion? Basically - there are typos here
&gt; and there, and the information is confusing, why don't they simply provide
&gt; the configuration files for people to download and simply ask them to
&gt; change
&gt; the IP address?
&gt;
&gt; Examples of typos:
&gt;
&gt; They ask to replace everywhere the IP addresses from 127.0.0.1 to your
&gt; own
&gt; IP... cool, then they ask you to test things like:
&gt;
&gt; "curl http://localhost:8080/riak-cs/ping" ....but wait, didn't you just
&gt; say to change all the 127.0.0.1 IPs to your own??? localhost is not binding
&gt; to 8080... so it will not work (yes, yes - maybe all they want is for
&gt; people
&gt; to buy their enterprise....)
&gt;
&gt; Here is another one among the same lines:
&gt;
&gt; curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/riak-cs/user \\
&gt; -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
&gt; -d '{"email":"ad...@admin.com", "name":"admin"}'
&gt;
&gt; Again 8080 on localhost... well - is anyone testing this stuff???? do
&gt; they even care to grow their user base...?
&gt;
&gt; It is rather frustrating... I also tried to install using the vagrant
&gt; one... yes - it almost seemed perfect... since they did all the work...
&gt; but... they forgot to mention that s3cmd assumes that authentication is
&gt; being done with new AWS API so we need to force V2 (signature\\_v2 = True) -
&gt; also they forgot to mention that HTTPS is not enabled in the vagrant
&gt; fasttrack RIAK-CS - why make the user have to troubleshoot more? Well -
&gt; that's one way to get them to learn a bit or waste their time Googling for
&gt; the answer...
&gt;
&gt; Despite of all of this - I haven't been able to install successfully on
&gt; my own on real servers (single server in the worse case) - correction, I
&gt; was
&gt; able to install, start everything, but I can not create an admin user... so
&gt; now I am going to copy whatever is in the vagrant files and pull them over
&gt; to my physical systems...
&gt;
&gt; Yes - this is not a question - just hoping these guys can rectify the
&gt; doc
&gt; issues - obviously not much QA going on their documentation - the stuff
&gt; does
&gt; not work, that's a fact.
&gt;
&gt; Regards.
