Hi,

Actually the Riak defaults will suit you fine for n\\_val and other
bucket properties. You may want to reduce ring size from 64 to 16
since it'll be a small cluster. If you reduce ring size, you'll want
to execute the "rm" command I provided to clear out data and
configuration, then re-start your nodes and re-build your cluster.

Have fun with your project.

&gt; Hello Luke, I've been reading some documentation and now I have a greater
&gt; clue. I want to set a 3-node cluster, according to what I read I have to set
&gt; the target\\_n\\_val = 3 and then, from the app that I have to develop, create
&gt; buckets with an n\\_val = 3 as well, so data can be replicated on the 3 nodes.
&gt; My question is, is there anything else I need to know? Maybe about the
&gt; hashing function? This is just a college project, the amount of data that is
&gt; going to be processed is everything but BIG haha.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance :)
