Thanks very much for your prompt replies. I am using the bitcask backend.
For now I am just trying to use /home/nabil/riak as the directory as I test
this out on my development machine, although naturally that is not the
ultimate destination we have in mind for our production servers.

I have changed all of the paths quite similarly to the linked gist. There
are indeed errors in the Riak logs; I've pasted them here:
http://pastebin.com/tQer69eJ

As you can see many of them appear to related to file permissions, but like
I said I've chowned the directory to the riak user and group:

[nabil@localhost riak]$ pwd
/home/nabil/riak
[nabil@localhost riak]$ ls -latrR .
.:
total 8
drwxrwxr-x. 2 riak riak 4096 Apr 4 11:59 .
drwx------. 62 nabil nabil 4096 Apr 4 15:51 ..


Any additional advice you can give would be much appreciated. Thanks again
for what you've already told me.

Nabil

&gt; start w/ "/data/riak". If you're still having issues, or you have changed
&gt; all the paths: are there any errors in the Riak logs?

&gt;&gt; Hello all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to change /etc/riak/app.config to store data in a directory of
&gt;&gt; my choosing rather than the default one. Simply changing platform\\_data\\_dir
&gt;&gt; to another directory yields errors, even after a `chown -R riak:riak` of
&gt;&gt; the relevant directory; the service starts but any attempts to use the REST
&gt;&gt; API yield 500 Internal Server Errors. Trying to change other things, such
&gt;&gt; as the ring\\_state\\_dir, generally results in riak failing to start at all.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does anyone have an example configuration where data is stored in a
&gt;&gt; different directory to the defaults, or advice about where I might be going
&gt;&gt; wrong?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm using a binary install of riak 1.4.8 on CentOS, if that's relevant.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Nabil
