I'm happy to finally launch "A Little Riak Book"[1] to the public. Sure, it's 
been available on github for a while now, but there was no website. Now it's an 
Official Thing. It's also totally, unregrettably, free (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0).

This is not meant to be an advanced or comprehensive book, just rather a short 
(60 pages or so) introduction to Riak. It's currently available in HTML, PDF, 
ePub and mobi (Kindle) formats. Soon there will also be a dead-tree version 
(about 95 pages), but you'll have to show up to a Basho event[2] to get one, 
whenever we get around to printing them which is entirely up to Tom Santero (so 
go ahead and bother him: tsant...@basho.com or @tsantero or by phone).

If you run into any problems, please feel free to log an issue on the book's 
github repo[3]. Or better yet, make, a pull request. Please don't respond to 
this announcement with issues, I may miss it.

Thanks to many people who have helped, and continue to help keep me honest, 
especially:

John Daily
Bob Ippolito
Ricardo Tomé Gonçalves
Macneil Shonle
And everyone else who submitted an issue, patch, or constructive comments.

Thanks,
Eric Redmond
