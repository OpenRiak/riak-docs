I accidentally emailed him directly and didn't include the list asking the
same thing, and he responded that he is using Riak on Suse according to
http://wiki.basho.com/Installing-on-SUSE.html so it is outside of our
package builds. Unfortunately I don't know how the Suse builds work at the
moment, so I'll have to look into them a bit more.

If anyone else on the list has knowledge of running Riak 0.14.2 on Suse
using the community packages, feel free to chime in with your experiences.

&gt; &gt; &gt; At this time there are no plans for a 0.14.3 release.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just to be clear: are there any plans to cut a release with the 14B03
&gt; &gt; fixes in it anytime soon (perhaps 0.15, etc..I don't care if it is
&gt; &gt; literally another 0.14 point release per se). FWIW, I am dead in the
&gt; &gt; water w.r.t. Riak until this is fixed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; The prebuilt riak binaries shouldn't use the system erlang install, the
&gt; binary includes its own copy of the erlang VM. The R14B03
&gt; incompatability will manifest as a compile time issue too, not a runtime
&gt; one. I suspect something else is wrong.
