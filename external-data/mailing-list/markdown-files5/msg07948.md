Hi Basho and Riak Users,

I am in the process of evaluating Riak for commercial usage here at
Playmesh. Riak seems great and has a lot of features we like but I am
running into some difficulties in my initial testing.

I am attempting to hit the database at 100 rps on a single machine (aka one
node). In doing so, I run into a number of problems (tcp sockets closing
being the primary one). I am using the Erlang client and have tried talking
to Riak through a single client process and also by spawning a new
concurrent process for every request.

I suspect that Riak is throttling the number of allowable concurrent
connections. Also, I suspect that my understanding about how to properly
utilize the Erlang client is underwhelming at best.

Any suggestions on how to properly set up a local test bed for Riak and
communicating to Riak?

Thanks,
Jeremy
