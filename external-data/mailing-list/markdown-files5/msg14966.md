I have map bucket with some data( with neseted maps )
aprox structure( don't know does it matter or not ):
{
"update": {
"some\\_register": "value",
"some\\_flag": "disable",
"nested\\_map": {
"update": {
"nested1\\_map": {
"update": {
"some\\_register": "value",
"some\\_flag": "disable",
}
},
"nested1\\_map": {
"update": {
"some\\_register": "value",
"some\\_flag": "disable",
}
}
}
},
"some\\_counter": 13,
}
}


Updates works fine. Even simultaneous
But Sometimes I need recreate entire value, so I Delete it using
curl -XDELETE http://host:8098/types/maps/buckets/mybucket/keys/some

After that sometimes siblings appears.


curl -H "Accept: multipart/mixed"
http://host:8098/types/maps/buckets/mybucket/keys/some

show that confict with delete

Further updates to datatype using
http://host:8098/types/maps/buckets/mybucket/datatypes/some NOT create new
sibling. It is replace previous one.

Problems:

1. I should remove datatype with different method? Or how to resolve such
conflicts? probably
Data I receive is binary, and query like
curl -H "Accept: multipart/mixed"
http://host:8098/types/maps/buckets/mybucket/datatypes/some
to get json data not works.Should I post it as binary back?


2. I have also search index on this bucket.
 each further updates to this datatype before resolution creates new
records in solr because
\\_yz\\_id includes sibling id:
1\\*maps\\*mybucket\\*some\\*34\\*46hGXxyhuW3yn3L8bRHIml

good news that when I delete record again all entries in solr deleted too.
