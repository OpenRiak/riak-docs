Hi José,

Other than links, what object metadata are you trying to access or modify?

Thanks -

&gt; Thanks Brian for your reply and trying to work out the links part. I
&gt; took a look at the RiakObject and could see how to manipulate it with
&gt; FetchValue and the Secondary Index. However, I failed to figure out
&gt; how to access the meta while reading an object. Just as an example,
&gt; when you're updating an object you could be using some meta data, and
&gt; some of them come from a prior read.
&gt;
&gt; If you could just share some examples with code that'd be very helpful.
