Hey all,

 I've been bashing my head against the wall most of the day trying to
figure this out. I can't get search to return me any results even when it
should have some positives -&gt; http://pastebin.com/Tu6F2FEG.

I've just upgraded my Riak install from v0.14 -&gt; v1.0. I wasn't using Riak
Search previously but have just decided to turn it on and try to get it
working with the latest release. I actually need to analyze some data
sitting in there via search (needless to say I'm very behind on jamming out
a report). I tried to track down an answer on IRC earlier today with no luck
in finding a result.

Here's the steps I've gone through today:

 - Flipped the search configuration to true in the app.config file
 - Added the precommit hook to the bucket (lets call it "my\\_bucket" for
 the time being) and verified them via cURL
 - Setup a script to GET and rePUT all of the KV's in the my\\_bucket and
 have verified this works
 - Checked the logs folder for any error/warning messages (crash.log,
 error.log, console.log, erlang.log, sasl.log, etc)
 - Tested search via the commandline (e.g. search-cmd search my\\_bucket
 attribute\\_name:term\\_that\\_should\\_be\\_here)
 - Tested search via browser -&gt;
 
http://my.awesome.site:8098/solr/my\\_bucket/select?q=attribute\\_name:term\\_that\\_should\\_be\\_here

I'm not really sure what else I can do to fix the issue. Any suggestions on
what else I should check/verify/double check/triple check? Thanks in
advance!
