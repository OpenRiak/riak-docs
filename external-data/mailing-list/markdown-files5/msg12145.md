Hi all,

we have a riak cluster up on AWS ec2 that we like to do daily backups
of. Since we use the leveldb backend the backup routine is to stop a
node, make a snapshot of the ebs volume and then start the node again.
The node is down just a couple of seconds.

What we noticed is that we get a lot of hinted handoffs between the
nodes and although we've raised the transfer limit during the backup
it still takes a lot of time.

Is there any danger of not waiting for handoffs between taking down
nodes for backups?

How do you do backups?

Thanks
David Jensen
