Hi Daniel,

How many nodes?
-You should be using 5 minimum if you using the default config. There
are reasons.

How much ram per node?
-As you noted, in Riak CS, 1MB file chunks are stored in bitcask.
Their key names and some overhead consume memory.

How many objects (files)? What is the average file size?
-If your size distribution significantly skews &lt; 1MB that means you
will have a bunch of files in bitcask eating up ram.

Kota was a former Basho engineer who worked on CS... That said, Basho
may not support a non standard deployment.

&gt; experience with using leveldb backend instead of the mutli backend for CS?

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have a Riak CS cluster up and running, and am anticipating exponential
&gt;&gt; growth in the number of key/value pairs over the next few years. From
&gt;&gt; reading the documentation and experience, I've concluded that the default
&gt;&gt; configuration of CS (with riak\\_cs\\_kv\\_multi\\_backend) keeps all keys in RAM.
&gt;&gt; The OOM killer strikes when Riak uses too much RAM, which is not good for my
&gt;&gt; sanity or sleep. Because of the amount of growth I am anticipating, it seems
&gt;&gt; unlikely that I can allocate enough RAM to keep up with the load. Disk, on
&gt;&gt; the other hand, is less constrained.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A little background on the data set: I have a sparsely accessed key set.
&gt;&gt; By that I mean after a key is written, the more time passes with that key
&gt;&gt; not being accessed, the less likely it is to be accessed any time soon. At
&gt;&gt; any given time, most keys will be dormant. However, any given key \\_could\\_ be
&gt;&gt; accessed at any time, so should be possible to retrieve it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am currently running a smaller cluster (with smaller nodes: less RAM,
&gt;&gt; smaller disks) than I expect to use eventually. I am starting to hit some
&gt;&gt; growth-related issues that are prompting me to explore more options before
&gt;&gt; it becomes a dire situation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My question: Are there ways to tune Riak (CS) to support this scenario
&gt;&gt; gracefully? That is, are there ways to make Riak not load all keys into RAM?
&gt;&gt; It looks like leveldb is just what I want, but I'm a little nervous
&gt;&gt; switching over to only leveldb when the default/recommended config uses the
&gt;&gt; multi backend.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As a stop-gap measure, I enabled swap (with swappiness = 0), which I
&gt;&gt; anticipated would kill performance, but was pleasantly surprised to see it
&gt;&gt; return to effectively no-swap performance levels after a short period of
&gt;&gt; lower performance. I'm guessing this is not a good long-term solution as my
&gt;&gt; dataset grows. The problem with using large amounts of swap is that each
&gt;&gt; time Riak starts it needs to read all keys into RAM. Long term, as our
&gt;&gt; dataset grows, the amount of time needed to read keys into RAM will cause a
&gt;&gt; very long restart time (and thus period of unavailability), which could
&gt;&gt; endanger availability for a prolonged period if multiple nodes go down at
&gt;&gt; once.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
