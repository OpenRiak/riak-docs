Hi Shimon,

As noted in the README, the new version of the Java client (v2.0) is a
work in progress and not yet usable; while the core is mostly complete
there's currently no user API. Work on that is progressing, and we
hope to have a release candidate available at the end of the month.

The current 1.4.2 version of the client will work with Riak 2.0
preview, but unfortunately does not support the new features in Riak
2.0

Thanks,
- Roach

&gt; Hi Riak users,
&gt;
&gt; I want to start checking out Riak 2 and for that I need the new Java client
&gt;
&gt; I downloaded it from Git but it will not build.
&gt; It seems to be missing a few dependencies (One of them was protobuf which I
&gt; actually downloaded and built but it did not sync)
&gt;
&gt; Is there anywhere I can download the Jar or get detailed instructions of how
&gt; to build the project?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
