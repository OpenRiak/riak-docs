Hi,

I have a question regarding the most efficient way to perform a search / lookup 
for something. This isn't a typical range lookup (where you want to find all 
objects given a specific range). In this case I want to find
a specific object where a lookup value falls within that objects range.

My use case is as follows.... I have the following domain object:

MyObj
startVal (long / number)
endVal (long / number)
..... (other data)

I need to perform many lookups where I need to find a specific domain object 
given a long value that falls within startVal & endVal (inclusive).

What would be the most efficient way to do this in Riak? I can't think of a way 
I could do this via directly lookup, so that only leaves me with 2i and search 
as possible options.Â 
They seem a bit like overkill, since in this case I am only interested in 
getting back a single object... but there doesn't see to be any other way to do 
this.

Would 2i or search be the most efficient / least impactful way to perform this 
type of search?


Thanks.
