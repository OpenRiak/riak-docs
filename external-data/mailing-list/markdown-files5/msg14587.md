Hi,

I'm looking at using a Riak backend in a new component.

My current client is a Spring shop. I'm not all that knowledgable about the 
intricaies of Spring , so this question many not make sense, but I am hoping to 
integrate Riak in a Spring friendly way.

I was looking at the 
spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue
 project, but that's been deprecated in favour of 
spring-projects/spring-data-riak
 which is empty.

Does anyone know of a Spring-Riak integration project that is high quality and 
currently active - preferably with excellent documentation and examples ;)

Thanks,

Simon.
