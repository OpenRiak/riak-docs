workshop he delivered last week at OSCON. Thanks, Jeff!

2) Francisco Treacy spun up a new repo on GitHub called
"Connect-Riak," a Riak Session Store for Connect backed by riak-js.

4) We put some office hours on the calendar at BashoWest. These will
be happening on Wednesday in San Francisco. Hope to see some of you
there.

5) A few very cool jobs to pass along (courtesy of a recent Hacker
News poll). H/T to Jared Morrow for bringing these to my attention.

and Riak experience. Read more here ---&gt;

\\* Pixfizz in Barcelona is looking for Riak, Node.js, and Rails
hackers. Some details here ---&gt;

(Also, if anyone from Adcloud or Pixfiizz is on the list, I would love
to hear more about how you're using Riak...)
