Hi,

I am a PhD student working on distributed key-value storage systems like Riak. 
Recently we have built an adaptive middleware framework which can continuously 
tune kv store configurations (e.g., via existing tuning knobs, and newly 
added/proposed knobs) to meet consistency/availability service level agreements 
under changing network conditions. We have deployed our system on top of Riak 
via a small amount of code change in Riak (which could be submitted as a 
patch), so that kv store developers can automatically tune the system to meet 
SLAs. Now we are interested to contribute to the Riak community by adding our 
code to the Riak code base via a patch.

Can anyone kindly suggest how to go about this? Any suggestions would be highly 
appreciated.

Thanks
Muntasir.
