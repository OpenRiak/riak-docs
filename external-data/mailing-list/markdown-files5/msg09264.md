Agreed that I would not try this in production. If possible I would still like 
to see if CI has a way to do this before I go and implement a custom web 
request to do this.

&gt; This is well-documented in our docs [0]. Please note that this is
&gt; \\*not\\* recommended for production use (as the page states). I took a
&gt; quick look at the CorrugatedIron docs [1] and didn't find any details
&gt; on how to do this which means that either a) I missed it or b) OJ and
&gt; Jeremiah saved you a lot of production pain by not implementing it. :)
