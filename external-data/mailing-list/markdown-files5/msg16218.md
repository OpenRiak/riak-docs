&gt; c: +1 617.817.3195 Here's The Recap up to the end of May:
&gt;
&gt; ## Honest aside
&gt; The deltas on recaps are getting a little long this time of year with
&gt; all the conferences. I'm working on getting back down to minimum of 1
&gt; every 2 weeks.
&gt;
&gt; ## Bringing back Community Release Notes
&gt; Have you brought Riak into production at a new place?
&gt; Did you find a blog or presentation helpful?
&gt; Good! Share it in our release notes. This is important enough to link
&gt; out of order:
&gt;

Additionally, I'd like to thank Mark Steele for a number of
contributions to Riak PG over the past couple weeks.
