Hi,My question is simple, but really I cannot find a clear answer anywhere in the documentation. I understand how a cluster works, and how a hook works, but if you have a hook on a certain bucket and commit to a node on that bucket, is the hook triggered only on that node, on all the nodes, or only on the nodes that will actually host that key?I ask this because I deployed my pre-commit hook to one node only, and then sometimes the insert failed telling me my precommit hook was "undef", and it was fixed by deploying the hook to all vnodes.Thanks!
