Hi,

We currently using riak java client 0.15.0-SNAPSHOT, but there is no better 
interface for RiakSearch at the moment. We are trying to fetch data from a 
bucket with million rows, here is a gist of issues we are facing with different 
approaches:

 \\* MapReduce:
 \\* Using mapreduce, the data response is just too slow due to the fact 
that this is a O(N) operation of going through the keys list.
 \\* Solr Client:
 \\* Using Solr Client, we are able to query but the response takes a long 
time about 4seconds to return a nominal result is still slow. [I heard the 
normal response time is approx 200ms]

Is there a way in the current java client to fetch large amount of data in 
nominal time.

What is the recommended approach of saving / retrieving / querying this data in 
the fastest possible way?

Thanks
Harshal
