Hello Bryce,

&gt; Hey Hector,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for looking into this, here is the response to 'java -version'
&gt; on my machine:
&gt; java -version
&gt; java version "1.7.0\\_51"
&gt; OpenJDK Runtime Environment (fedora-2.4.5.0.fc19-x86\\_64 u51-b31)
&gt; OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)
&gt;
&gt; I've been meaning to try buiding from source to see if the problem cropped
&gt; up again, just haven't had the time yet. (I noticed that I didn't have the
&gt; same issue when I built from source on my archLinux desktop --2.0pre14 --.
&gt; Not sure if its related, but I just wanted to make sure).

solr stdout/err: Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
com/basho/yokozuna/monitor/Monitor : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0

This is saying that com.basho.yokozuna.monitor.Monitor was compiled
with J2SE1.8. That will not work with your 1.7 JRE. If you compile
from source then you won't have this issue.

The problem is that Yokozuna has some custom Solr handlers and they
are compiled independently for each separate official Riak builder we
have. In this case our Fedora builder has "javac 1.8.0-internal".

This is my fault. The importance of the compiling JDK and our builders
totally slipped my mind. Yokozuna needs to be changed so that we just
compile the JAR once and include it as part of the official build
process.
