&gt; Obviously, I'm sort of stumbling around here, and I didn't realize
&gt; that there was a dependency on protobuffs within erlang.
&gt;

You don't need to have protobuffs installed on the Erlang VM. I'm saying
that you \\_shouldn't\\_ have a protobuffs version globally installed as my
guess is that could be picked up by reltool which is responsible for
building the Riak release. You will want to uninstall erlang-protobuffs.

 code:which(protobuffs).
&gt; I get
&gt; non\\_existing
&gt;
&gt;
This is good, that's what you want in this case.


&gt; After I ran "yum install erlang-protobuffs", I now get:
&gt;
&gt; "/usr/lib/erlang/lib/protobuffs-0/ebin/protobuffs.beam"
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; That sounded promising, but even after "make distclean" and "make rel"
&gt; the file "./rel/riak/lib/protobuffs-0/ebin/protobuffs.beam" is still
&gt; the smaller size and does not include the symbol next\\_field\\_num
&gt;

I'm not sure how but when you run `make rel` it is picking up a different
protobuffs version from somewhere in your environment. Try doing something
like `sudo find / -name 'protobuffs.beam'` and see what turns up.
