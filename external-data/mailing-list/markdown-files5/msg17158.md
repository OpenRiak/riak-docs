Hi Oleksiy,

As Russel pointed out, 2i queries, including $bucket queries, are only
supported when the backend supports ordered keys. This is currently not the
case with bitcask.

It appears, though, that you have discovered a bug where the multi-backend
module accepts the query despite the fact that the actually configured
backend for the bucket(-type) cannot support the query. I'll make the
engineering team aware of this.

At this point in time I can only recommend that you do not use the $bucket
query with your configuration and use an alternative, such as Solr-based
search instead.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
