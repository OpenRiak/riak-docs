Soren,
Thanks for the response. The information is useful, however I tried using
DROP in place of REJECT and the result is much the same: activity stops for
two minutes and then resumes.
Regards,
Malcolm

&gt; &gt; During the run, I use iptables to simulate a network partition in which
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; node in the cluster is disconnected from the other four (but all five
&gt; remain
&gt; &gt; connected to the client). To disconnect from node A, for example, I run:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; sudo /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -s  -j REJECT
&gt; &gt; sudo /sbin/iptables -A OUTPUT -d  -j REJECT
&gt;
&gt; This will not simulate a network partition. It will simulate Riak not
&gt; running on the given node. REJECT means a response is "sent back" to
&gt; the requestor, saying that the connection was rejected. Using DROP as
&gt; your target would more closely mimick a network partition as any
&gt; attempts to contact the node in question will be met with silence.
