&gt; 1) Which version of riak are you running? I think there are more
&gt; messages in the mailing list about people who have had nodes get stuck
&gt; leaving (it's worth also searching for "handoff" as that's the part of
&gt; the vnode lifecycle which is the important one in a node leaving
&gt; manoeuvre).

Riak 0.14.2. and most of the email list mailings were about issues
with 1.0 or greater.

&gt; 2) I think to play it safe, it's probably best to have the nodes leave
&gt; one by one. I don't know exactly how riak keeps track of network
&gt; partitions, but I could imagine it seeing 3 nodes dropping off as some
&gt; kind of network partition rather than those 3 nodes wanting to leave.

Yeah, I kind of figured this, however, as it stands now, even if I fully
wait for one to leave I can only ever have one node leave. Any subsequent
node seems to just ignore the leave command.
