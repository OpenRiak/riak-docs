Would you mind sharing that app? If you have time since I am not familiar
with Node.js would you mind showing me how you ran it as well as the source.
Thank you.

Subject: Re: Import tables/data from Microsoft SQL Server

 

There is nothing that I have come across. What I did in the past was run a
quick Node.js app that pulled data out of SQL Server using one of the
available drivers and serialize and write to Riak. It is not perfect, and
may be slow depending on the amount of data but it does work.

I would like some scripts or programming tools that I could use to transfer
existing data held in Microsoft SQL Server databases into Riak. Do such
tools exist?
