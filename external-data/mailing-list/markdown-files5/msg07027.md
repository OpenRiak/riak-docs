Hi there -

Nice to e-meet you! I recently joined Basho and hope to have the chance to
talk with more of you soon.

Sending a note because we've been thinking a lot about how we can provide a
better dev experience for Riak users, specifically on http://wiki.basho.com/ -
we have a bunch of ideas (interactive tools, a revamped Fast Track, more
extensive client library documentation...) but we are also looking for more
ideas and a special someone who could work with us on the docs, design,
information structure, and basically anything we need to make getting up
and running with Riak beautiful. It's a contract, PT position for now but
we'd love to learn and grow with someone who already loves Riak and has
some great ideas to make it more lovable. You'd be working with me, Mark
Phillips, and lots of other Basho people (we've got a great team!) Location
not an issue.

Description here:
http://bashojobs.theresumator.com/apply/bE6g35/Technical-Writer-Parttime-Temporary.html

Let us know if you're interested or know anyone who would be a great fit.
And in the meantime, please feel free to send any feedback on our docs and
overall developer experience to me!

Cheers,
Shanley
