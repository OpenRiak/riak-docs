Having hunted through the docs and the sources for the ruby client, I cannot 
see how one should delete a CRDT object.

I have a bucket of CRDT maps, created using a bucket type which specifies the 
correct type to use. All operations with these CRDT objects appear to working 
properly, and they are being indexed in SOLR correctly, so all is well. 
However, the only available delete method I can find is via the bucket. This 
method does not take a bucket-type parameter, so a call to the bucket to delete 
a given key is actually operating in the wrong namespace - the default one, 
rather than the bucket-typed one.

Can anyone advise?

Thanks,

Paul
