Hey everyone,

I'm beginning to experiment with Riak and I'm trying to better
understand how to model my data. One question I have at the moment is
how to evolve my data with a data store such as Riak? I know that
it's schema-less and that I can add new fields as needed but I'm
thinking more about the existing documents.

For example, say hypothetically, that I have a fairly successful
riak-based app. As the application code continues to evolve over
several versions I begin to find a "better" way to model my data. By
this time I have already stored many, many documents. What is the
appropriate path here? Do I version my documents with metadata and
rely on my application code to continue to deal with old-style
documents -- or do I perform some sort of bulk transformation on these
existing documents?

Thanks,
Allen
