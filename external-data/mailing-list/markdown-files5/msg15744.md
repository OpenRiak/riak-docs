Hello Cezary,

Firstly, are you able to retrieve your search result consistently when not 
using doing a mapreduce job? 

To better help out, can you send a gist of the mapreduce code youâ€™re running? 
Thanks.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a search index, and I'd like to run mapred job against that index. 
&gt; The thing is, for a search query that should return exactly one result, I 
&gt; sometimes (not always, yet not rarely) get none, i.e. the mapred job returns 
&gt; an empty list instead of, say, a list containing a single object. Did this 
&gt; only happen some time after uploading the data and then was consistently 
&gt; giving the right results, I wouldn't object. However, it's kind of an 
&gt; on-and-off situation - I get proper results, but then for a brief period of 
&gt; time I don't and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; I've read on a solr doc page that specifying a timeAllowed parameter in the 
&gt; query can give it longer to gather results and help, but that can't be 
&gt; specified in a mapred definition, or can it?
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anything else I can look for?
&gt; 
&gt; The data I'm querying is of the CRDT map-of-sets type, should that be of any 
&gt; relevance.
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; Cezary
