And you pass the vclock back after a GET with the next POST? Unless we get a 
look at the vclocks then it's hard to say why or where you have concurrency. 
But since concurrency is ultimately unavoidable using riak, why the concern? 
Can your application/data model handle it is the main question?

&gt; Thanks, Russell! I do a GET immediately after a POST is done. I use apache 
&gt; httpclient, which handles requests synchronously. On the client, POSTs and 
&gt; GETs are sent out sequentially.

&gt; &gt; Just curious. The POSTs are sent out sequentially and a quorum is set up on 
&gt; &gt; Riak. I wonder how would it happen that Riak still considers the POST 
&gt; &gt; requests concurrent?
&gt; Did you read the result of POST 1 before sending POST 2? If not, and you 
&gt; donâ€™t send the causal context, Riak has to view them as concurrent.
&gt; 
&gt; How does the quorum work here?
