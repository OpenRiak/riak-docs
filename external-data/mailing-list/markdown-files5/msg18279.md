I haven't used bucket types that much so have no real idea of why it
thinks that a bucket type is deleted.

If you read the error log it seem like {name
{&lt;&lt;"commercial"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"commercial\\_systest"&gt;&gt;}}. As I said I'm not that
familiar wit bucket types but having a tuple as name feels odd. What
bucket types do you have and how did they get created.

Regarding the cluster how many nodes are there, what happened to the
node that went away, was it gone for long before being removed. I'm
poking since as far as I can read there is no way of removing a bucket
type so it could be something internal that has gone wrong. How did
you deploy the new node, was it installed using script could it be
that you created the bucket type once more before joining the new
node. did you force-remove and then add a new one or did you do force
replace?

I'm in way over my head with bucket types but maybe someone else can
jump in once they get online.

&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure but looking at the exception and the code you get function
&gt; clause error because you have the first argument being '$deleted' and the
&gt; function guard expects lists as arguments
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\\_core/blob/master/src/riak\\_core\\_bucket\\_props.erl#L129
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The reason for it being '$deleted' I don't know, have you done anything to
&gt; bucket properties or is it just replacing a node?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards
