&gt; I've just tried to put an object without a key as described in the docs, but
&gt; this feature doesn't seem to work (sasl-error.log attached):

I'm assuming both the client and server are running latest from git,
right? The server needs to be updated to support this as well. This
feature is not present in any stable release at the moment.
