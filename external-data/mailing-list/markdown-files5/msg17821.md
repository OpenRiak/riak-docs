Greetings,

I am not able to answer your tombstone questions. That question needs a better 
expert.

Just wanted to point out that Riak now has global expiry in both the leveldb 
and bitcask backends. That might be a quicker solution for your frequent 
delete operations:

Technical details for the leveldb expiry are found here:

&gt; Hello Riakers
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if there is anyway to delete all tombstones that were left behind 
&gt; when delete\\_mode was set to 'keep'
&gt; 
&gt; Also how do I estimate how much space the tombstones take ? We have a ton of 
&gt; large scale and frequent delete operations and I suspect some space is used 
&gt; by Tombstones. I would like to find out if it is significant enough to 
&gt; warrant some cleanup. If it does, how do I remove them?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks and wish you all Happy, Peaceful and Prosperous 2017 !
