&gt; Thank you. That worked. I think that the rolling upgrade page needs to be 
&gt; changed to mention that. Step 6 does mention the add\\_paths, but it is not 
&gt; clear what needs to be changed. It mentions .beam files, but I had no idea 
&gt; what that is, if I am using them or what I should be changing.
