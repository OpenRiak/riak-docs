Hi Jared, 


I don't see these patches, which I have applied to our installation of 1.3, 
explicitly mentioned in the Release Notes: 


Fix bug where stats endpoints were calculating \\_all\\_ riak\\_kv stats: 
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/blob/9be3405e53acf680928faa6c70d265e86c75a22c/src/riak\\_kv\\_stat\\_bc.erl
 



Every read triggers a read-repair when Last-write-wins=true 
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/pull/334 


Can you confirm whether or not they made it into 1.3.1, please?

I hesitate to reply to my own email, but just wanted to point out that this 
issue https://github.com/basho/riak\\_core/pull/281 listed in the release notes 
should help all of you who had issues with slow bitcask startup times in 1.3.0. 
If you see or don't see improvements let us know. 


Thanks, 
Jared
