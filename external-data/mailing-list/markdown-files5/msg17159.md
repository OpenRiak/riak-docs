Hi Magnus,

Yes, thank you. Though I'm stuck a bit. When I experienced recursive
behaviour with paginated $bucket query I tried to create Yokozuna Solr
index with an empty schema (just \\_yz\\_\\* fields). Unfortunately querying
Yokozuna gives me inconsistent number of results as described in my another
email in this mailing list. Hopefully it will be solved as well :)

&gt; As Russel pointed out, 2i queries, including $bucket queries, are only
&gt; supported when the backend supports ordered keys. This is currently not the
&gt; case with bitcask.
&gt;
&gt; It appears, though, that you have discovered a bug where the multi-backend
&gt; module accepts the query despite the fact that the actually configured
&gt; backend for the bucket(-type) cannot support the query. I'll make the
&gt; engineering team aware of this.
&gt;
&gt; At this point in time I can only recommend that you do not use the $bucket
&gt; query with your configuration and use an alternative, such as Solr-based
&gt; search instead.
&gt;
&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt;
