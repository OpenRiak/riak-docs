Paul, if you're still debating your options...

It's difficult to know without testing, but I suspect Bitcask plus the disk 
cache on HDDs will make it possible to achieve your performance numbers, given 
the high percentage of reads on a relatively small number of queues.

The tool basho\\_bench[1,2] is designed to help evaluate performance of a Riak 
environment, and combined with something like baremetalcloud[3] you may be able 
to verify for yourself without much investment.

(Be careful with billing, however; baremetalcloud will charge in advance for 2 
weeks of use of the hardware currently in your account if you're not careful.)
