Vamsi,

It's hard to say without more information. Is the 200% being used by
`beam.smp`? Do you see anything in console.log, error.log or crash.log
that would indicate something odd is happening? Are there clients
communicating with the cluster at the time? If so what client/protocol are
they using and what types of operations are being performed (e.g.
get/put/map reduce/etc)?

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; I was setting up Riak server on a server and it doesn't have more than 5k
&gt; instances of data too. I have a very basic 2-Node cluster setup. But, some
&gt; times when i check my cpu usage on server it is going for more than &gt;200%
&gt; and the node is getting terminated because of that. What might be the
&gt; issues for causing this kind of problems? When I don't have any data on my
&gt; riak node then it was working perfectly fine.
&gt;
&gt; Any insights are much appreciated.
