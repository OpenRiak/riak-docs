Ok, so now I can see in the "leaving" node logs:
2012-01-26 19:18:23.015 [info]

r...@ec2-othernode.compute-1.amazonaws.com' completed: sent 5110665 objects
in 3905.97 seconds

so things \\*are\\* moving but at a rate of 1308 records per second.
This sounds very slow to me, accounting for the small record size, the high
bw rate inside ec2 and practically 0% load on the servers

any thoughts?

&gt; Hi all
&gt;
&gt; I have a 6 server cluster running on ec2 (m1.large) - this is an
&gt; evaluation environment, so practically no load besides the existing data
&gt; (~200 million records, ~1k each)
&gt;
&gt; after running "riak-admin leave" on one of the node, I noticed that for
&gt; more than 3 hours
&gt; 1 - member\\_status showed that there is one "leaving" node and pending data
&gt; to handoff on the rest but the numbers never changed
&gt; 2 - riak-admin transfers - showed handoffs waiting, but nothing changed
&gt;
&gt; at this point, I restarted the "leaving" node, so now the status is
&gt; 1 - member\\_status - still stuck with the same numbers
&gt; 2 - transfers - are slowly changing
&gt;
&gt; The leaving server's logs are showing that a single handoff started after
&gt; the restart,but nothing since (roughly an hour ago)
&gt;
&gt; Interestingly, the leaving server is pretty idle while the remaining
&gt; servers are working hard at 50%-60% cpu
&gt;
&gt; so, the question now is where should I dig around to try and understand
&gt; what's going on. Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Gal
