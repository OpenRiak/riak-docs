I found that the items which have been deleted, or updated are not 
updating in the search index.


There is a key value pair like this,

"1131" =&gt;
{
 "titlename": "title",
 "description": "desc",
 "tags": "magazine english"
}


Then it is deleted using curl -XDELETE 
http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/bucket/1131


Searching for tags:magazine using solr interface still finds this item. 
But it is hidden from the results.


Now I update the item with some garbage value like "1131" =&gt; "blah blah"

Searching for tags:magazine again finds this item and it shows up in 
results like this


1131 =&gt;
{
 "titlename": "blah blah"
}

It is very inconsistent. Please help me fix the issue.

Thanks

Hi,

I did a search query using riak search solr interface requesting 20 
rows starting from 0. The results page shows numFound to be 278 but 
returning items count is 18.


I'm curious to know under what circumstances can this happen.
