Small correction to today's recap: I was, in fact, working on persisting Rabbit 
queues in Riak using Rabbit's pluggable queue provider API. I never did get 
that far due to lack of time but it seems quite possible.

&gt; 
&gt; Riak Recap 9/13 - 9/14
&gt; 
&gt; 1) You may remember a few weeks back on the list I asked "Who is Using
&gt; Riak" --- 
&gt; http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\\_lists.basho.com/2010-August/001869.html
&gt; . The resulting page went live yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; Check it out here ---&gt;
&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1802621
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to everyone who stepped up to offer information on their Riak
&gt; usage. And, of course, it's never to late to be a part of the page.
&gt; Let me know if you and yours have something that should be added.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Sean Cribbs presented Riak at the KC Ruby meetup last night. As
&gt; usual his slides are exceptional.
&gt; 
&gt; Check them out here ---&gt;
&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/seancribbs/introduction-to-riak-and-ripple-kcrb
&gt; 
&gt; Also, based on this tweet, it would appear that things went well ---&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; For those of you who haven't seen yakriak, it's really something
&gt; special. Check it out here ---&gt; http://github.com/seancribbs/yakriak
&gt; 
&gt; 3) grantr kicked off a lengthy chat in #riak with seancribbs,
&gt; benblack, and jdmaturen when he asked "Anyone working on a riak
&gt; storage driver for rabbitmq?"
&gt; 
&gt; Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/581081
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Q --- Any word on future riak core posts from kevin smith? (from
&gt; technoweenie via #riak)
&gt; 
&gt; A --- More posts are planned but, sadly, there is no specific
&gt; date for their release.
&gt; 
&gt; For those of you who haven't had a chance to read it, here is the
&gt; first Riak Core post ---&gt; http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/?p=539
&gt; 
&gt; 5) Q --- On the Links and Link Walking page it says Riak can
&gt; substitute for a graph DB "as long as the number of links is kept
&gt; reasonably low." What "number of links" does this refer to? The total
&gt; number of links in the whole Riak cluster? or the number of outgoing
&gt; links on any given document? (from pjstadig via #riak)
&gt; 
&gt; A -- The number of links on any given document. (I've updated the
&gt; wiki to clarify that.)
&gt; 
&gt; 6) j2043 kicked off a brief but valuable conversation with bingledac
&gt; and benblask when he asked "With Riak 0.12 Is there an upper limit on
&gt; the number of keys in a bucket? "
&gt; 
&gt; Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/581141
&gt; 
&gt; 7) Q --- Anyone have a link for the memory usage formula based on
&gt; number keys? (via wrecked)
&gt; 
&gt; A --- A while back Jeremy Hinegardner (know on IRC as "copius")
&gt; offered up a capacity planning document that he put together. We
&gt; tweaked it to reflect the recent memory usage enhancements to bitcask.
&gt; Here it is ---&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Jeremy!
