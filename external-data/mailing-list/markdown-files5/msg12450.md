Could you do it? Sure.

Should you do it? No.

An advantage of Riak is that you can avoid the cost of SAN storage by getting 
duplication at the machine level rather than rely on your storage vendor to 
provide it.

Running Riak on a SAN also exposes you to the SAN becoming your bottleneck; you 
only have so many fiber/iSCSI ports and a fixed number of disks. The risk of 
storage contention is high, too, so you can run into latency issues that are 
difficult to diagnose without looking into both Riak as well as the storage 
system.

Keeping cost in mind, too, SAN storage is about 10x the cost of consumer grade 
SSDs. Not to mention feature licensing and support... The cost comparison isn't 
favorable.

Please note: Even though your vendor calls it a SAN, that doesn't mean it's a 
SAN.
