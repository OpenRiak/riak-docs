Hi Tilman,

We have worked on some prototypes of server-side CRDTs, but those
prototypes have stalled. We intend to pick them up again soon. I assure you
-- especially in light of our recent presentations about them -- that
implementing CRDTs is high on our priority list for upcoming release
cycles. When we have more to talk about, we'd be happy to discuss it with
you.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; In Bob Ippolito's talk at InfoQ about Statebox Andy says in the end "not
&gt; to be surprised" to see something similar to Statebox in Riak (as higher
&gt; level API or something). I'm sure there are efforts to offer CRDTs as part
&gt; of Riak. I know there is also Eric Moritz's projects. I'm wondering what
&gt; the situation currently looks like, what to expect or not to. I'm
&gt; particularly interested in the Erlang side of things.
