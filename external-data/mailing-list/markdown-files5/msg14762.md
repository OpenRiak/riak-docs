Any thoughts about this?

One thing it worries me about Riak Search is that if one index has several
millions of object to search for maybe it becomes slow? 2i might be faster
then?

Thanks!

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; I had been seeing lately Riak Search as an ultimate way to query Riak...
&gt; and it seems recommended to use over MapReduce and even 2i... said so...
&gt; should we try to always use Riak Search over the other systems?
&gt;
&gt; Is there any situation in which MapReduce could be a better approach than
&gt; Riak Search?
&gt;
&gt; Same goes for 2i... I believe 2i is an optimal approach if you just want
&gt; keys and know very well what are you looking for, but out of that, should
&gt; Riak Search try to replace all 2i uses?
&gt;
&gt; Practical example: If you are twitter and want to get twits for the
&gt; hashtag #Riak, what would be the best approach? 2i? Riak Search? MapReduce?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
