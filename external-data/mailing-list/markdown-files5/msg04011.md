Hi, Maria.

In addition to what others have said, I would note that (at least) the
following issues matter quite a bit for such planning:

- how many items the data is broken up into
- how large the keys will be (especially if they are very large due to
embedded structure)
- what storage engine ("backend") is in use
- how many machines are in the cluster
- the N-val, or how many replicas are being stored (default is 3)

If you know those things, then you can make a more meaningful estimation.

I hope that this helps.

-Justin
