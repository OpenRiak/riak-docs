Guys,

Just released a new 0.3 version of Raiku; a non-blocking performance focused 
Riak client for Scala.
 
0.3 is a major release, featuring a large amount of new features:

- The IO layer is upgraded to Akka 2.2, delivering more performance and 
stability;
- Connection are now begin handled by a configurable amount of actors, 
supervised for reconnection and error recovery;
- Streaming MapReduce support is added to the client, using the Play Iteratee 
library;
- MapReduce jobs / sockets are handled by a different actors pool: longer 
MapReduce won't directly consume performance and sockets from the normal 
functionality; 
- A unique MapReduce DSL, offering deterministic phase retrieval through tuples 
with either result lists as result enumerators;
- A naive reactive bucket, making it able to use Riak in a reactive data flow 
through (for example) the Play Framework;
- Several bug fixes and performance improvements.

Cheers,

Gideon
