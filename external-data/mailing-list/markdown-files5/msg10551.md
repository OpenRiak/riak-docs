Hi. I'm looking for alternative to postgresql in my project.
I have two problems with postgres:
1) if master goes down, problem must be resolved manually and very quickly
2) I want cross datacenter replication

Here is my schema: http://pastie.org/7058511

In short: client is a user that is logging in on my server and he has many
sub-users and many servers.

I need to make lookups like "give me all sub-users of this client" and
"give me all servers of this client".

Also, there is going to be a huge traffic to update "users" table:
aggregated statistics about their usage.

Is riak ok for it? Will secondary index help me with it?




I have already looked at Couchbase. It has wonderful admin console, but it
failed to launch when my IP address has changed and it has no erlang API.
