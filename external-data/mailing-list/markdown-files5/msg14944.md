This issue was related to
http://riak-users.197444.n3.nabble.com/HTTP-Access-Log-Performance-Log-issues-td4031830.html#a4031849.

Basically, when HTTP logging was enabled, memory usage started to gradually
increase until the Riak cluster ran out of memory.

It looks like after Riak attempts to roll the log file, all subsequent logs
get buffered rather than written to disk, which eventually causes it to fall
over.

Basho, are there any plans to fix this?
