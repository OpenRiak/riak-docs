Indeed, the problem is harmless, other than generating log spam.
Unfortunately, while the patches that Jared mentioned address similar
errors, the specific "exit with reason noproc in context
shutdown\\_error" might still happen on 1.3.2 and 1.4.x. It's a race in
the shutdown monitoring logic of Erlang/OTP's 'supervisor' module (see
my last comment on riak\\_pipe issue #49 [1]). The fix requires more
restructuring than we had time to do for the 1.4 release. Despite the
'error' level of the log (which is set by code we don't control), the
race is harmless, and the correct logical thing (making sure the
process is dead) is happening.
