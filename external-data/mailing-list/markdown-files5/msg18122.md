Batching parameters only affect the update operations, so while deletes are 
relevant, none of the batching parameters will affect the issue you are seeing 
with TTLs that are only implemented in the back end.

One thing that might help, in the future, is the sweeper functionality, which 
is currently on the develop branch. This allows you do do deletes in a way 
that all Riak subsystems are notified. I don't have a timeline for the release 
of the next version of Riak that includes this functionality, but I can say 
that "it passes all the tests", FWIW.
