Hi Paul,

I just wanted to let you know that I'm currently investigating this and
will get back to you shortly.

I've opened the following issue for tracking it:

https://github.com/basho/riak\\_control/issues/128

In addition, in retrospect I've realized that using the "incompatible"
language is a bit misleading -- only a subset of functionality becomes
unavailable when Control detects a possible incompatibility, and this is
usually limited to display a node's memory utilization (leaving management
commands unaffected.)

I've opened the following issue for tracking updating the language to
provide a less ambiguous, more concrete, display of what is actually
happening within the cluster:

https://github.com/basho/riak\\_control/issues/127

Thanks for being so patient and diligent with testing our latest releases!

- Chris

&gt; I upgraded my cluster to 1.4.1 in hopes the levelDB changes may help. The
&gt; cluster is now up and running, however Riak Control is complaining:
&gt;
&gt; The following nodes are currently incompatible with Riak Control:

&gt;
&gt; I googled around and saw this had something to do with the RPC calls
&gt; failing, but I can't find any logs on the server that give me a hint where
&gt; to go next.
&gt;
&gt; When I rebuilt from source, my rel directory was nuked, so I needed to
&gt; regenerate my certs. Would this screw things up?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
