Hi Riakators,

Here's your regular Recap of what's been happening in the last two weeks.

\\*Recently answered\\*

 - John Daily gives a definitive answer
 

 to whether the riak-erlang-client can see update events
 - Cosmin is pointed in the right direction
 

 for the use of RiakLinks with POJOs in the Java Client
 - There's an interesting discussion on whether Riak offers a Redis style
 LTRIM
 

 which Alexander clarifies quite well here
 

 - There are a few great threads
 

starting
 from a conversation about increasing cluster size in production

\\*Still open\\*

 - Roman could use some help understanding node relation on a new cluster
 

 - Michael has a question about the Erlang client
 

 that's unanswered
 - Zsolt has a great question about detecting that a strong consistency
 bucket is ready for use
 

 in the Erlang client



\\*Event news\\*

 - Our co-hosting of the New Stack Meetup
 

 on March 3rd is just around the corner. We'll see you in Seattle then!
 - We have multiple Basho engineers speaking at Erlang Factory
 

 on 26-27 March
 - We're still planning Meetup events in San Francisco and New York City
 in the next few weeks. Join any of these groups 
 to keep up with the news

\\*For the weekend\\*

 - There is a ton of documentation updates
  that are well worth
 a review
 - If you haven't seen these yet, our own Christopher Meiklejohn
  posted some incredible slides
 including an introduction to Riak
  and an
 introduction to webmachine
 
 that are well worth your time

\\*Your turn\\*

 - What did I miss? What are you up to? Sharing is caring and you can
 always share here

Thanks for reading,
