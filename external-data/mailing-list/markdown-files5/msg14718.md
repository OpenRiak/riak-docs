We have a 5 node riak cluster.
Two nodes in this cluster, had to be removed because they are no longer
available (since a half year).
So a force remove was done.

After this, the 3 remaining nodes began to transfer all data. So we ended up
with a complete unresponsive system. The iowait is blocking us now.
So we are hoping that this will settle today, the next transaction was
actually adding two new nodes.

And yes this is production, Is there any chance we lost data?
