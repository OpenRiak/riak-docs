Riak users subscribers -

I would like to add the caveat that this workaround indicates an
environment-specific issue and not (at this point) a bug in Riak. I am
working to get to the root cause (pun intended)

Thanks,
Luke

&gt; All, the issue is fixed now - the problem is that Riak precommit and
postcommit hooks seem to work only in root user mode. On AWS, switching
from ec2-user to root user fixed the precommit trigger issue.

user account. For example, Postgresql runs fine as non-root user.
