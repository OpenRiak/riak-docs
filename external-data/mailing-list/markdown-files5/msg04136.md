MapReduce ( or a simply Map ) gets really slow when database has a
significant amount of data ( or distributed over several servers ). Get
instead is always faster as Riak doesn't have to search for the key (
you tell Riak exactly where to GET the data in your url )

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; (I
looked at various places for the information, however I could not
&gt; find
anything that would answer the question. It's not completely ruled
&gt; out
that not all places were checked though :))
&gt; 
&gt; I use PB erlang
interface to access the database. Given a bucket name
&gt; and a key, the
value can easily be extracted using:
&gt; 
&gt; {ok, Object} =
riakc\\_pb\\_socket:get(Conn, Bucket, Key),
&gt; Value =
riakc\\_obj:get\\_value(Object)
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, a mapred (actually, just
map) request could be issued:
&gt; 
&gt; {ok, [{\\_, Value}]} =
riakc\\_pb\\_socket:mapred(Conn, [
&gt; {Bucket, Key}
&gt; ], [
&gt; {map, {modfun,
riak\\_kv, map\\_object\\_value}, none, true}
&gt; ])
&gt; 
&gt; I would expect that
the result is the same while in the second case, the
&gt; amount of data
transferred to the client is smaller (which might be good
&gt; for certain
situations).
&gt; 
&gt; So the [open] question is: are there any reasons for
using the first
&gt; approach over the second?
