Hristo,

How are you communicating with Riak? Which client library is being used?

&gt; Hello,

&gt; I am using a strongly consistent bucket type. I need to simulate instances

&gt; disconnect and destroy the memory (through a signal handler).
&gt;
&gt; Sometimes, when process recovery occurs, performing a get on an object is 
&gt; successful, however a subsequent set with the Vector Clock from the previous 
&gt; get results in the error “Cannot send another request while one is in 
&gt; progress”. I found the error in riak\\_api project, file 
&gt; riak\\_api\\_pb\\_server.erl, but don’t really understand why the error gets 
&gt; thrown. Would someone be able to instruct me as to the cause of the error? I 
&gt; am using the current riak version from the main repository.
