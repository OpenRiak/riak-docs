Hey,

I'm specifically concerned about connection reading, data sending,
data encoding and decoding. Is that done by a single process, a
fixed-size process pool or does Riak spawns a new process for every
incoming request/connection?

Thanks very much !
Jing

&gt; Hi Jing,
&gt;
&gt; Depending on what you're looking it, it might be handled differently.
&gt; Typically, a process pool is used to handle incoming requests, but
&gt; processing of the request itself is handled by several processes that
&gt; operate concurrently.
&gt;
&gt; What specific operation are you referring to?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
