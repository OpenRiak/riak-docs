Hi

I have Riak servers A, B and C.
As I know, assume I put my data into Riak server A via HTTP interface,
I will hashed and determined to be stored in some other servers. May be
finally stored into B and C.

What I want is listen to the upload event.
And one and only one of them A, B, C kick off some external process.

Any API for that ?
Or I should have watching processes in all A, B, C servers (will have race
condition and locking problem)?

Sorry, I am new to Riak. I may miss some important components.
Please point that out to me.

Thanks
