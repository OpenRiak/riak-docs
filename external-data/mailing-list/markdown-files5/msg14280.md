Hi all,

In the beginning we were running four nodes with n-value of 2. The partitions 
were distributed 25% for each node. Now when we added fifth node (still having 
n-value of 2), the partitions are distributed in following way: 25%, 19%, 19%, 
19% and 19%. The ring size in use is 64. Is this normal behavior? The cluster 
seems to be working correctly. However I was expecting each node to have 20% of 
the partitions.


Best regards,
Manu Mäki
