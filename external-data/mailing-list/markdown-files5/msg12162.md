Hi.

I'm creating Puppet configs for a Riak/Riak-CS/Stanchion stack. Ideally I want 
the stack to come up with some predefined users and buckets already created. 
This is all predicated on having an admin user created in Riak-CS which is 
problematic in the Puppet automation realm given this value has to be generate 
via a POST to a running Riak-CS application and then set in the app.config file.

Is it possible to bootstrap Riak-CS with an admin user some other way than 
POST'ing to a running app?

Thanks,
Dan
