Riak Recap for October 31 - November 1
==============================

1) Clint Shryock has a new project on GitHub called "sinatra-riak," a
data-browser of sorts that runs as a Sinatra app.

2) We merged another sizable contribution from Greg Stein to the
Python Client. Thanks, Greg!

3) Ian Plosker put together a great piece of documentation about when
to use MapReduce, Search, and Secondary Indexes in Riak.

6) The team at Bump Technologies gave a great presentation last night
about how and why they are using Riak and Haskell. Will Moss and the
team were kind enough to pass along the slides.

7) Riak (Search) 1.0 has some new admin commands and we finally got
around to adding then to the wiki.

\\* Search ---&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/Command-Line-Tools---search-cmd.html

8) The video from Russell Brown's "Handling Conflicts in an Eventually
Consistent System" talk is online.

9) Julio Capote is working on a "disk backed, fast k/v cache" powered
by Webmachine and Bitcask.

\\* Code here ---&gt; https://github.com/capotej/nolimit
\\* Also, I heard a rumor that his library was named after No Limit
Records, you should probably listen to this track while reading the
source code [Somewhat SFW] ---&gt;
