I tried lmdb in an iOS project recently and while it is indeed fast i also

did run into several issues. I needed something seriously faster than SQLite
and after some experimentation ended up embedding leveldb in stead.


1. When storing objects larger than the page size (default is 4k) then
those

pages are not taken from the free list (since they need to be consecutive) but
always adds to the file size. This means you can easily run out of space.

That restriction was removed a few months ago. (December 2012)


2. The fact that it can only have one write transaction open means that
you

have to be very careful in not causing serious lock congestion.


So in my experience it only makes sense to use in a read-heavy application with 
mostly small values.


Yes, LMDB is designed for read-heavy applications.
