We're working on a test where we want to add batches of keys to Riak. We're 
using the LevelDB backend with 1.0. One suggestion we heard was to take down a 
node, batch insert directly into the backing store, and then bring the node up 
again.

Could someone give us some more details on this? How would Riak know which keys 
in LevelDB had not yet been redistributed to the rest of the cluster?

Thanks,
Nate
