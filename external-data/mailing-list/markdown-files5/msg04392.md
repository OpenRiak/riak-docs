this is certainly a tricky problem for us, because there are times we need
to perform 9 to 100 GETs on per page render basis. some bullt-in
support would certainly be useful

&gt; This begs the question, is there much efficiency to gain by creating a true

&gt; efficient multi-get possible.
&gt; If I remember, it was closed as a wontfix a couple years ago.  Did you guys
&gt; at Basho find that it just didn't have that much impact on performance?

&gt;&gt; As Matt and Jacques noted, M/R is really not intended to be used in
&gt;&gt; this manner (i.e. for multi-get), particularly if you're interested in
&gt;&gt; latency. Generally, you will wind up involving more nodes on a M/R
&gt;&gt; request and shipping the "get" results across those nodes as the
&gt;&gt; system tries to distribute M/R.
