Is anyone doing Change Capture (like the Databus project from LinkedIn)
directly out of Riak? Right now I have something hacked up using
Ripple+ActiveModel::Dirty, but I'd like to divorce it from our app
completely if possible. Was thinking a post-commit hook might work? End
goal is to feed it to a logging backend (in the Kafka sense of the word)
for other systems to feed off of.

I'd love any pointers you might have to past posts I've missed (tried
searching the archive but came up dry), code, ideas, "tried it and it was a
pain", "that's a stupid idea", etc.

Thanks!
