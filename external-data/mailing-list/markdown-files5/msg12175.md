Good morning!

For Riak 2.0, we're no longer supporting HTTP in official clients. This 
cuts down on the implementation size substantially[1] and means we can get 
client versions supporting new server features in your hands faster.

Unfortunately, there are a few features that don't have protocol buffers
implementations. For example, Luwak support is already gone from the next
version of the client.

Link Walking[2] is another feature that's not implemented in protocol 
buffers. For the uninitiated, link walking is similar to a SQL JOIN, but
implemented with map-reduce jobs.

If you currently use link walking, would it be problematic to have it 
implemented in a separate riak-client-linkwalking client-side gem 
instead of on the Riak server?
