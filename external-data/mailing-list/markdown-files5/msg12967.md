I would like to start up riak with it's config, data, and log files in a 
specific location that is not the default. I know that this can be accomplished 
via symlinks, but I would like to do this by passing run-time params or setting 
environment variables.

Are there any specific changes that I could make to lib/env.sh that would 
accomplish this without introducing other issues? Or is there any other way to 
do this?

Thanks,
Jeff
