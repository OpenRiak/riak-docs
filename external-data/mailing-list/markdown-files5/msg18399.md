&gt; I've been actively trying to migrate over to Minio for S3 storage, instead.
&gt; Worth a look, and unlike riak CS, has had lots of active development in recent
&gt; times.

Regarding minio, we had a look a few months ago when deciding about object 
storage. We discarded it mainly because at that time there was no way to 
replace a damaged disk. That is, if you got 4 disk and 1 breaks, you will keep 
with 3 disks. Self-healing was close to beta stage, but the fact that it 
weren't considered a zero-day feature discouraged me a bit. It was also unclear 
about growing capabilities respect to the allocated storage size. Actually, I 
was told on the slack channel that it wasn't possible.
The other primary alternative we evaluate was swift, but discarded because it 
seemed too big for our current needs & infrastructure.
