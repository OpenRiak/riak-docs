CRDT deletion is handled through the `RObject`:

```
bucket = client.bucket 'maps'
robject = bucket.get 'my\\_crdt\\_name'
robject.delete type: 'maps'
```

I agree that the Ruby client interface for bucket types needs some work: it's 
functional right now, but not great. Once the push for 2.0 is done, I'd like to 
make it a bit more monadic \\*\\\\*dodges thrown burrito\\\\*\\*.
