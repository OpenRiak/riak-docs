However, since you've mentioned copying from cluster to cluster, 
expect a sales call any minute…to preempt that, let me tell you about 
a wonderful piece of software we sell at Basho that could solve this 
very problem for you…http://basho.com/riak-enterprise/ Cheers Russell 


Preempting that call, we're already happy customers of Basho, and so 
could use riak-enterprise. We're using this method for low-level dev 
copy of the cluster, rather than real-time inter-DC for production data, 
and it suits us to have simple control of how & when this happens.
