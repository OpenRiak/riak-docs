Thanks for the feedback! I've added an issue[0] to our basho\\_docs

Thanks Brian. I keep forgetting about the docs repository. I'll use that 
in future.



I think the `riak-admin aae-status` command that provides the kind of
information you need in your second request , and there is also some
documentation currently available for its use[2].


Yes, I'm aware of the aae-status command. I'm after more of a node total 
of AAE repairs rather than per vnode. I could write a script to total 
all the vnode stats. How lightweight is the aae-status command? Is it OK 
to run once per minute?
