Hello everyone,

I've put together an ODM [1] for Riak and Node.js. I tried a few of the
the available packages, but none were to my liking. I wanted something
that used protocol buffers, json schemas, and promises. So I made one.
 It's here:

https://github.com/natural/zukai

Feedback, bug reports, general comments and criticisms are always welcome.
 Best,

troy


[1] I think "ODM" is a little silly and wouldn't the term if there were
something better.
