Hey,

I found some time today to play around with Riak. Nice work guys,
seems like a great product so far.

I downloaded the OSX distro, and started the node but the web
address/port was not bound. It turned out that I had to remove the
comments in the app.config in order for the configuration to work
properly. Wondered if this was a general issue or a local problem.

Cheers,
