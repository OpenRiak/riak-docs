3) Q --- Anyone have a good set of munin plugins for Riak? (from
chip\\_\\_\\_ via #riak)

 A --- Nothing I know of. Anyone have anything they can share?

4) Q --- Is it possible to delete data in a bucket from inside a
map/reduce job? (from http402 via #riak)

 A --- Yes. Using an Erlang MapReduce Function. Start with this:
 http://contrib.basho.com/save\\_reduce.html
 and modify accordingly.

5) jtuple and rando had a short convo in #riak that started with "is
`riak-admin join` idempotent?"
