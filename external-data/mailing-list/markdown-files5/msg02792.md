ring\\_creation\\_size is the key setting. Once you set it for a cluster it is a 
lock. Check the deets on the wiki. 

cookie : erlang clusters share a cookie that they all need to have in the 
config. Make it sUp3rSp3c!aL!.

name : each host needs its own unique name. Something like riak@private-ip-addr 
will work. 

That's about all you need to keep in mind.

Yes, the question is, what would you need to change in that initial setup to 
have something that would migrate, still running to some larger number of nodes 
on other machines? A larger number of partitions?

&gt;&gt;&gt; For the general and common cases of testing - ie development,
&gt;&gt;&gt; verifying application and cluster behavior in case of failures etc a
&gt;&gt;&gt; simple "make devrel" works fine for me. I run Riak directly on my MBP.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; As others have pointed out - load testing and tuning for production is
&gt;&gt;&gt; another story.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What would have to be changed from the devrel version to get something where
&gt;&gt; you could simply add other nodes to migrate to production - and maybe
&gt;&gt; eventually remove the originals?
