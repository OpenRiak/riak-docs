Ah, excellent news then! It would be great to have our platform on Riak 1.0
prior to our own 1.0 release, which is looking to be sometime during
September/November, so that's good to hear :-)

Is a roadmap available, or will one be available in the near future?

&gt; Jonathan,

&gt; We're planning to ship 1.0 at the end of September. A couple of the items
&gt; that are planned for this release:
&gt;
&gt; \\* Secondary indicies
&gt; \\* Improved MapReduce system (based on riak\\_pipe)
&gt; \\* riak\\_search merged into base product (versus a separate download)
&gt; \\* Logging system overhaul
&gt;
&gt; There are (a few) other major features cooking on the branches, but they
&gt; could float in/out of the release depending on a number of internal and
&gt; external factors.
&gt;
&gt; Hope that helps,
&gt;
&gt; D.
