&gt; Awesome. Grats on the release and all the hard work that went into it.

&gt; 1. I heard differing things when I asked in other forums but I wanted to get 
&gt; an answer here, does Riak CS support range requests? Aka give me bytes 
&gt; 100-200 from this 3MB file. 

As Reid Draper said on HN, yes it does support range queries.

&gt; 2. Pricing. Is Riak CS priced like S3 in terms of storage volume, bandwidth 
&gt; and lookups?

Pricing is per-node. I believe you can cram as many CPUs, drives and RAM
info a node as you want and pay the same flat per-node price.
