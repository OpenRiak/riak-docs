n\\_val is 3 for us and we have 3 nodes

&gt; Hello everyone,

&gt; I've just joined the list, and am a bit late to the party. Sorry about
&gt; that. Thought I would contribute an answer anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Santi, what is you n\\_val?
&gt;
&gt; I observed the behavior you are describing on Riak 2.0.0 with n\\_val=3 in
&gt; two cases:
&gt;
&gt; 1. One of the nodes was not part of the cluster although the cluster was
&gt; thinking it was. Don't ask me how that happened. Obviously, when a request
&gt; hit that node part of the entries could not be found there.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Look for indexing errors in Solr console and Riak logs. Each Riak node
&gt; has its own Solr "repository", so if an entry fails to be indexed on any of
&gt; them, search results will be inconsistent depending on which set of nodes
&gt; returns it. Let's say you have replicas on nodes A, B, and C. Entry X
&gt; failed to be indexed on A, entry Y failed to be indexed on A and B, and
&gt; entry Z was indexed OK on all nodes. Then you may get {X,Y,Z}, {X,Z}, or
&gt; {Z} as your search results.
&gt;
&gt; In our case the indexing failures were caused by disk/filesystem errors.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Vitaly
