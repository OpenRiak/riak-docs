Apologies for the bump!

Basho guys, can I get a confirmation on the uniqueness of links between two
objects please? (Before I go an modify the code in my app to suit)

Thanks
Matt

&gt; Hello list,
&gt;
&gt; Once upon a time, a link from one object to another was unique - you
&gt; couldn't add two links from object A onto object B. I know this as I had to
&gt; code around it in our app.
&gt;
&gt; At some stage that limitation has been removed - in either the Python
&gt; bindings or Riak itself.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone else confirm this? Basho peeps, are non-unique links the
&gt; intended behaviour?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
