Hi,
I seem to be getting significantly slower performance out of Riak CS 
than I expect to see, and I wondered if I could get some advice about 
where I might be going wrong.


I have a cluster of six nodes, with fairly good sequential-write disk 
performance, for eg:

# dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=1M count=500 conv=fsync
524288000 bytes (524 MB) copied, 1.27205 s, 412 MB/s

The riak partition is formatted as ext4, with data=writeback and 
barriers disabled.


So given n\\_val=3, and six nodes with ~400MB/s transfer rates, you'd 
expect to see some pretty fast transfers, right?


However the actual performance I'm getting is reliably a mere 9MB/s for 
a single client writing to the cluster. (On a 500M transfer)



Is this kind of performance normal for this hardware?
If not, could you give me some pointers about what to check?

Thanks,
Toby
