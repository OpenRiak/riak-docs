I guess the fundamental question is: In new clusters unaffected by pre-1.0
shenanigans, should we \\*ever\\* be using client-provided ClientIds in our
vector clocks, or is this method deprecated?

I ask because I was deep into figuring out how to do this efficiently with
the Riak PBC API for PUT requests, when I realized that the documentation
for HTTP PUT no longer even mentions
it
.

If client-id isn't totally deprecated, I will probably start finding a way
to shoehorn it into individual PBC PUT requests, as keeping a
per-connection client id is very onwieldy. Please advise. :)
