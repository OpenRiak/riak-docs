Hi Yan,

Sorry about being late to the game here, but, to paraphrase the great
Brian Sparrow [0], if you bring up the node with the same ip and node
name, "force remove" isn't your best option here. You'll want to do a
riak\\_kv repair [1] on the partitions that node owns.

Hope that helps.

Mark

&gt; I know it's not good to use RIAK in VMs, but even so I would like to get
&gt; some support in one scenario:
&gt;
&gt; We have a 4 node RIAK cluster, each one in different VMs. In case one of the
&gt; VMs goes down and needs to be restarted in a different machine (so it won't
&gt; have the same data as the node it's replacing), what's the best strategy to
&gt; add the new node in the cluster? It may possibly have the same IP as the
&gt; node that went down. What I thought was:
&gt;
&gt; 1. force remove the node down from the cluster;
&gt;
&gt; 2. bring up new VM with the new node;
&gt;
&gt; 3. cluster join the new node.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a better way to do this, especially because the new node have the
&gt; same IP as the old one. Also, is it possible to do something like a
&gt; riak-admin cluster join from one of the clients or it's from the CLI only?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
