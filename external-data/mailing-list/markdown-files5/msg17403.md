Hi Luke,

Cool, understood :) then is not as troublesome as I thought.

Thanks,
Alex

&gt;
&gt; Yes. There is no concept of "master" or "slave" with Stanchion, since
&gt; only one Stanchion process should ever be running at a time and
&gt; servicing requests.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, you said that if Stanchion is down it can not create users and
&gt; &gt; buckets... but can it still create keys inside the existing buckets? and
&gt; &gt; also read data from the nodes?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, since these operations do not involve Stanchion.
