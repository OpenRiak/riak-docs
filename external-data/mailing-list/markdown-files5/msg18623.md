Good job on finding and fixing so fast.

I have to ask. What's with the naming scheme? Why not 2.9.2 instead of 
2.9.0p2?


Cheers

Bryan,

We saw that Riak was using much more memory than was expected at the 
end of the handoffs.  Using `riak-admin top` we could see that this 
wasn't process memory, but binaries. Firstly did some work via attach 
looping over processes and running GC to confirm that this wasn't a 
failure to collect garbage - the references to memory were real.  Then 
did a bit of work in attach writing some functions to analyse 
process\\_info/2 for each process (looking at binary and memory), and 
discovered that there were penciller processes that had lots of 
references to lots of large binaries (and this accounted for all the 
unexpected memory use), and where the penciller was the only process 
with a reference to the binary.  This made no sense initially as the 
penciller should only have small binaries (metadata).  Then looked at 
the running state of the penciller processes and could see no large 
binaries in the state, but could see that a lot of the active keys in 
the penciller were keys that were known to have large object values 
(but small amounts of metadata) - and that the size of the object 
values were the same as the size of the binary references found on the 
penciller process via process\\_info/2..


I then recalled the first part of this: 
https://dieswaytoofast.blogspot.com/2012/12/erlang-binaries-and-garbage-collection.html. 
It was obvious that in extracting the metadata the beam was naturally 
retaining a reference to the whole binary, as long as the sub-binary 
was retained by the a process (the Penciller).  Forcing a binary copy 
resolved this referencing issue.  It was nice that the same tools used 
to detect the issue, made it quite easy to write a test to confirm 
resolution - 
https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/blob/master/test/end\\_to\\_end/riak\\_SUITE.erl#L1214-L1239.


The memory leak section of Fred Herbert's 
http://www.erlang-in-anger.com/ is great reading for helping with 
these types of issues.


Thanks

Martin

 Nice work - I've read issue / PR - how did you discover / track it
 down - tools or just reading the code ?

 There is now a second update available for 2.9.0:
 https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0p2.

 This patch, like the patch before, resolves a memory
 management issue in leveled, which this time could be
 triggered by sending many large objects in a short period of
 time.  The underlying problem is described a bit further here
 https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/issues/285, and is
 resolved by leveled working more sympathetically with the beam
 binary memory management.

 Switching to the patched version is not urgent unless you are
 using the leveled backend, and may send a large number of
 large objects in a burst.

 Updated packages are available (thanks to Nick Adams at TI
 Tokyo) - https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.9/2.9.0p2/

 Thanks again to the testing team at the NHS Spine project,
 Aaron Gibbon (BJSS) and Ramen Sen, who discovered the
 problem.  The issue was discovered in a handoff scenario where
 there were a tens of thousands of 2MB objects stored in a
 portion of the keyspace at the end of the handoff - which led
 to memory issues until either more PUTs were received (to
 force a persist to disk) or a restart occurred..

 Unfortunately, Riak 2.9.0 was released with an issue
 whereby a race condition in heavy-PUT scenarios (e.g.
 handoffs), could cause a leak of file descriptors.

 The issue is described here -
 https://github.com/basho/riak\\_kv/issues/1699, and the
 underlying issue here -
 https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/issues/278.

 There is a new patched version of the release available
 (2.9.0p1) at
 https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0p1. This
 should be used in preference to the original release of 2.9.0.

 Updated packages are available (thanks to Nick Adams at TI
