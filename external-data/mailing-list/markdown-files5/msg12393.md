&gt; Timo,

&gt; Your email again brought up the topic of fixing this issue within Basho's 
&gt; leveldb. Previously there had always been a "bigger problem" and we did not 
&gt; worry about tombstone (delete) purging. Today, we have all but one of the 
&gt; "bigger problems" coded. I therefore have created a plan to track tombstones 
&gt; and automatically perform background compactions to purge the old data and 
&gt; the tombstone. 
&gt; 
&gt; This tombstone initiated, background compaction will occur at a lower 
&gt; priority than ingest and directory size compactions.
&gt; 
&gt; The current plan would only "know about" tombstones created after the new 
&gt; code is released. It will not magically search your entire data set to find 
&gt; existing tombstones. But over time, any prior tombstones found in a regular 
&gt; compaction will lead to a grooming compaction of those tombstones.
