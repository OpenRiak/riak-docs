Hey Chris, thanks for the heads up.

We’re looking into issues #2 and #4, but we went ahead and fixed #1 and #3 
here. Let us know if 
anything else comes up!

We ran this rolling upgrade yesterday and it seemed to mostly work!

A couple problems we encountered:

1. The command under item 6 on this page 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/ts/1.4.0/setup/upgrading/ did not work for us. We 
had to replace “riak\\_ts” with “riak\\_kv”.

2. There were some transient errors from our clients about the server not 
supporting CRDTs (specifically sets):

a. Riak::ProtobuffsErrorResponse: Expected success from Riak but received 
0. `set` is not a supported type

3. The upgrade instructions weren’t clear about the fact that you need to 
update your riak.conf if you have any non-default settings before doing the 
“riak start” step.

4. There was a unit change for riak\\_kv.query.timeseries.timeout 
(previously timeseries\\_query\\_timeout\\_ms) in riak.conf that wasn’t clear to us 
from the upgrade instructions. We were under the impression that only the names 
had changed.

Subject: [ANN] Riak TS v1.4 is released


Dear Riak users,


Earlier today we have released Riak TS v1.4. This is well-rounded release, 
combining several new features, number of incremental improvements and bug 
fixes. Please upgrade your Riak TS clusters or if you still did not, take it 
for the spin. Any feedback, good or bad, is welcome. We do listen.



Release notes: http://docs.basho.com/riak/ts/1.4.0/releasenotes/


The new and improved features are:

• (NEW) GROUP BY statement can be used in SELECT queries. This allows to 
condense the result set using one of Riak TS aggregation functions. [1]

• (NEW) Users can now use textual date/time representations (per ISO 8601) in 
Riak TS SQL statements, without the need to translate to milliseconds before 
issuing the commands. [2]

• (NEW) Global object expiration (a.k.a. TTL - time to leave) at the backend 
(LevelDB) level allows efficiently remove aged data from Riak TS. [3]

• (NEW) Added SHOW TABLES command to list Riak TS tables from Riak Shell. This 
is in addition to riak-admin ‘bucket-type list’, which also works. [4]

• (NEW) Added official support for Debian 8 Jessie, dropped Debian 6. [6]

• (IMPROVED) DESCRIBE 

 command now returns quantum information, in 
addition to the columns names, types and primary key. [5]

• (IMPROVED) Fine grained security using Riak TS specific permissions. [7]

• (IMPROVED) Rolling upgrade and downgrade to and from Riak TS 1.3.1. [8]

• … many documentation and performance improvements.
