Hi, Age.

The Link header in HTTP as used by Riak is defined by RFC 5988. In the Link 
Relation Type registry (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-6.2.2) you 
can see that the relation type "up" refers to a parent document in a hierarchy 
of documents. In Riak, this means the bucket a key is in.

These are not Riak's own links, but rather an additional use of the Link header 
form which may be useful to some clients.

I hope that this helps.

-Justin

&gt; I've been looking at links and link walking and I noticed that Riak very 
&gt; often returns a special type of link with rel="up" instead of a riaktag, 
&gt; which is illegal for users to create.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the purpose of this link? (beyond the reasonably obvious "this key 
&gt; belongs to bucket X). Why was it added?
&gt; Are there other "rels" than "up"? 
&gt; Can they be followed through link walking?
&gt; 
&gt; This behavior is not documented anywhere that I (or Google) could find.
