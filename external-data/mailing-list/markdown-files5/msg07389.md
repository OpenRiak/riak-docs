&gt; Hey guys,

&gt; Still a relative newbie here.

&gt; I was hoping to be able to setup a MapReduce job that I could feed 1000 keys
&gt; to, and have it tell me of the 1000, which keys exist in the bucket. Â I was
&gt; hoping this could use the key index (such a thing exists right?) without
&gt; having to read the objects.

I can't help with the question but I have some that are related...
Assuming you store things with discrete keys that can be computed,
like a prefix and a per-second timestamp, is there a rule of thumb
about how big a range would be more efficient to retrieve by asking
for all possible keys vs. a map-reduce? Or is there a way to write a
map-reduce so that it computes the possible keys in a range and
returns any matching values instead of scanning the keyspace for them?
