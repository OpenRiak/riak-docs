Also I just realized I gave the wrong platform\\_data\\_dir in the
config-files.zip I sent yesterday. The correct path is shown in
riak-env.txt as well as generated.configs.tbz attachments sent later.

&gt;&gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Two questions:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; \\* Do you happen to have an /etc/riak/app.config file present?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; No.
&gt;
&gt; Not sure if relevant, but I did notice that /etc/riak-cs/advanced.config
&gt; does exist, which contradicts with what I said earlier. This is surprising
&gt; to me because I did not create this file. Maybe it was created by the riak
&gt; installer? Anyway, the content is:
&gt;
&gt; $ cat /etc/riak-cs/advanced.config
&gt; [
&gt; {riak\\_cs,
&gt; [
&gt; ]}
&gt; ].
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; \\* On one of your Riak nodes, could you please execute the following
&gt;&gt; commands:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; riak attach
&gt;&gt; rp(application:get\\_all\\_env(riak\\_kv)).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Copy the output of the previous command and attach as a separate file
&gt;&gt; to your response. Please note that the period is significant. Use
&gt;&gt; CTRL-C CTRL-C to exit the "riak attach" session.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Attached.
