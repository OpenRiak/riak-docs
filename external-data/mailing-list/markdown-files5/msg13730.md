Is it possible to turn anti entropy on and off without stopping riak entirely? 

Especially with the upgrade to 1.4.8 where it is recommended to delete the 
existing anti\\_entropy directory it seems that after the upgrade Riak is reading 
data continuously. Since it is not possible to limit the I/O used for AAE it 
would be nice if the anti entropy can be run only during off peak hours, at 
least until all have been rebuild.

Thanks,
Timo
