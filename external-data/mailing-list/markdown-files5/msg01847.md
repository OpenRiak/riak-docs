Morning, Evening, Afternoon to All,

Hope everyone had an enjoyable weekend. We have a great Recap for
today: new code for Ripple, a C client for Riak, a Riak-backed Tomcat
session manager, and a whole bunch of other goodies.

Enjoy.

Riak Recap for Dec 22 - 26

1) Sean Cribbs merged a piece of code from flippingbits that added
observers to Ripple.

Details here ---&gt; https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/compare/baa7fec...e11b0fe

2) The ever-active Jon Brisbin has a new project up on GitHub called
"riak-session-manager." It's the beginning of a Tomcat Session Manager
backed by Riak.

Repo ---&gt; https://github.com/jbrisbin/riak-session-manager

3) Chris Umbel has the beginnings of a C client for Riak available on GitHub.

4) I'm not sure if there are any Web.py fans out there, but it looks
like David Hollander is going to start working on a Riak-based
"skeleton user auth system."

Details here for anyone who is interested/might want to get involved
---&gt; http://groups.google.com/group/webpy/browse\\_thread/thread/7baad3a15882db0b

5) seancribbs and toflames had a short convo in #riak that started
with "I would like to know if it is possible to run a mapreduce query
on the results of another mapreduce query in riak."

Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/756228

6) Q --- If I use the value "quorum" as symbolic consistency for both
read and writes, will I get strong consistency? (from toflames via
#riak)

 A ---If by strong consistency, you mean "read your writes", then yes.

"Quorum" is talked about in several places on the Riak Wiki:

 
http://wiki.basho.com/dosearchsite.action?searchQuery.queryString=ancestorIds%3A1802841+AND+Quorum&searchQuery.spaceKey=RIAK

7) Q --- Does riak have a \\_changes feed like couchdb? (from hackeron via #riak)

 A --- No.

8) Q --- In regards to riak\\_kv\\_cache\\_backend, is the max\\_ttl a hard
cap? i.e., if there is an access at second 3599 will the object still
be evicted right afterwards or will it be extended for another 600s?
(from progski via #riak)

 A --- TTL is relative to last access so accessing at 3599s would
extend the lease.
