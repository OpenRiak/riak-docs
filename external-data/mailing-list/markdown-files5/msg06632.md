&gt; But there are other ways. Consider if you can define your key in a way, so 
&gt; you get the right resultset from doing a range-search from key1 to key2. You 
&gt; can also consider storing your data with secondary indeces for looking up on. 
&gt; It is my understanding, that riak does not (yet) support queries combining 
&gt; multiple secondary indeces in AND or OR searches.

You may not be able to do composite queries like AND or OR via the secondary 
index feature (2i) but you can do it via standard search. Check:
