Hi there,

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I read somewhere that custom
data-types can be created through schemas or something like that. So, apart
from COUNTERS, SETS and MAPS we could have some custom defined ones.

I would love to have a STACKS data-type that would work like a FIFO stack,
so I could save the last 100 objects for some action. Imagine we are
building Twitter where millions of tweets are sent all the time, but we
want to quickly know the last 100 tweets for a user. Imagine something like:

obj.stacks['last\\_tweets'].add(id\\_of\\_last\\_tweet)

IN: last\\_tweet ---&gt; STACK\\_OF\\_100\\_TWEETS ---&gt; OUT: older than the 100th goes
out

Is this possible? If so, how to do it?

Thanks and Best Regards,
Alex
