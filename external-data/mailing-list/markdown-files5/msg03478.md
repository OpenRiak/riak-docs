Put a proxy in front, block that request url.



Thanks Jonathan. Yep, that would work, but it adds another otherwise 
unnecessary component to my deployment, which I would like to keep as 
simple as possible. That is why I was hoping there would be some easy 
change that I could make to the app.config file.

&gt; I would like to use a "capability security" approach where all the keys
&gt; are unguessable random strings, such that possession of a key gives a
&gt; client authorization to fetch the data for that key, and a client who
&gt; does not have the key cannot fetch the data.
&gt;
&gt; However, the ability to list all the keys in a bucket defeats that
&gt; security model.
