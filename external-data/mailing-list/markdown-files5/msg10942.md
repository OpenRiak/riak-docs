Hello, and welcome to the latest (and regrettably late) Riak Recap.

Don't forget, RICON East is fast approaching. Smart people talking
about big ideas, at least until the alcohol flows too freely, at which
point all bets are off.
 http://ricon.io/east.html


This Recap introduces a new section, "Basho on the Road," where we
highlight opportunities to catch Basho engineers and other malcontents
out and about in the community. If you find one of these rare,
beautiful creatures in your neck of the woods, please introduce
yourself.
