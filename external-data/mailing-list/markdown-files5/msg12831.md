Hi,
I have around 5000 keys which just won't die.
No matter how many times I delete them, they still show up in the 2i
$bucket=\\_ index.

Actually attempting to retrieve the keys results in a not-found - even
if I've requested that tombstones be returned.

I'm interested to know what is going on here?


Anyone?

Should I report this as a bug against 1.4.2?
