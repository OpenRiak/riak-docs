At least on two-phase commit enabled environment you can implement the 
rollback to "undo" your action, you expect things to go right and a very 
small % to go wrong, so implementing a rollback policy isn't such a bad 
idea, I had to do the same years ago for a payment client, when things 
went wrong on our DB, we send a revert payment, since once the payment 
was gone, it had no transactional behaviour so we had to implement a 
rollback policy.


Hope that helps,

Guido.

Brisa,

You cannot simulate transactions, really (see also
http://aphyr.com/posts/254-burn-the-library). However, if you want to
receive notifications and take action when something happens, you can
add a postcommit hook (see
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/appendices/concepts/Commit-Hooks/).
In the past, developers have added hooks that push updates into a
RabbitMQ broker or ZeroMQ channel.

Hi,
I want to simulate a transaction.
I want to know when a riak operation happens.
I know that riak isn't a relational database, but it is important for me in
particular cases to undo operations when something goes wrong.
Any have any suggestion for me about I want to do?
Thank you very much.
