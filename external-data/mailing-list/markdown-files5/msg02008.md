Yes, it's best to wait until handoff is done. In the described setup, however, 
it was a "developer" setup on a single machine, probably without any data in it.

&gt;&gt; with dev1's yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Even regardless of existing active handoff transfers?
&gt; I mean should I wait for the end of existing transfers before join next new 
&gt; node to cluster or not?
