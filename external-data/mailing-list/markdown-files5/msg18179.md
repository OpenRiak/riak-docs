&gt; According to the docs 2.14 there is an issue executing the riak-admin

&gt; performance impacted when access stats via the HTTP interface /stats more
&gt; than once a minute?

Hi Travis,

Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. It appears that the
warning in the documentation is a left-over from a much earlier version of
Riak. The paragraph following the warning is correct; you can call
`riak-admin status` and access the HTTP `/stats` endpoint more than once a
minute without negative effects. We will correct this on the documentation
site soon.

Please be aware, though, that many of the properties returned are
accumulated over a floating one minute window. We therefore still advise to
gather the stats not more often than about once a minute, as more frequent
access will not generate more meaningful fine grained values.

Kind Regards

Magnus
