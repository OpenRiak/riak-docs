Sometimes I get siblings like this
- original object
- object modified from machine1
- object modified from machine2
- deleted object

4 siblings for one object. Delete happens only if both machines made
modifications to the object, so clearly object was deleted but not removed
from Riak db.
In my log I see that during delete new vclock is used (the one returned
during store in return body phase) which I think is correct behaviour.

I thought with that vclock Riak should figure it out that delete was latest
operation?

What is the best way of handling those scenarios? Should I fetch it and
delete it again?

Regards
Daniel
