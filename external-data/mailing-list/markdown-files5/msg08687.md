Hi,

I've been reading up on Riak search and am very pleased to see the new
index repair command in 1.2. However, it seems that in order to use it you
must be able to somehow detect when there are inconsistencies in your
search indexes across vnodes. While it's likely the inconsistencies would
be spotted by a user, it certainly wouldn't be good to wait for that before
trying to correct the issue. Is there any technique that can be used to
automatically detect replica loss?

Thanks,
Andrew
