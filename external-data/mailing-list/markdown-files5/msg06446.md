All, and especially Basho folks, what is the Right client to use from Erlang? 
I've been using the PB client, but dealing with the strange difference between 
riakc\\_obj and riak\\_object is making me question that choice. Is there a better 
answer?

If not, is there a recommended practice for dealing with the results of 
map\\_identity in clients using PB?

It seems like the distributed erlang client isn't really intended to be used as 
a "client library," given that it's buried inside riak\\_kv.

Any advice would be welcome, I don't really see a lot of documentation on best 
practices.

Regards,
Jeremey.
