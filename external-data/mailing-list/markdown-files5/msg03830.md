I've noticed that when I run the link function, it automatically
orders the links based on Id. Is there a way to tell it not to sort
the links? In other words, I want the links in the order in which
they were put in the list (most recent at the head of the list) and I
see from Rekon that that is how they are being stored. Basically, I'm
running a reduce\\_slice on the result of the link phase so that Riak
doesn't load up all the objects with which the links are pointing. If
the answer is no, I cannot control the order of the links, is the only
option to prepend something like the time (e.g. millis since
1-1-1970)?

Thanks,

Andrew
