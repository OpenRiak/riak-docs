If your writes and reads are written with PR+PW &gt; N (note PR/PW and not R/W), 
then you should get read-your-writes consistency. There is unfortunately a bug 
with PR/PW [1] that means this is not a 100% guarantee at the moment. I'm 
hoping for it to be fixed by Riak 1.4, if not earlier. I don't have JavaDoc 
handy, but setting PR and PW should be the same as setting any other 
per-request parameter. For an N value of 3 (the default), I'd likely recommend 
setting PR and PW to 2. You can get around the aforementioned bug by setting 
PR=PW=N, which will lower your availability, but gaurantee read-your-writes 
consistency.

Note that read-your-writes is slightly different than just monotonic read 
consistency, but I'm guessing it's closer to what you had in mind.

&gt; Hi there,
&gt; 
&gt; We're trying to implement monotonic read consistency at the client side using 
&gt; Riak's Java client. We're kind of stumped on how to do vector clock 
&gt; comparison so we can ensure that we're always getting the latest version.
&gt; 
&gt; Any tips would be appreciated.
&gt;
