The new sets aren't sorted, they're just proper sets.

Riak isn't fundamentally changing from a key value store, the values of the new 
data types are just convergent. So you still retrieve the whole value at a 
time, no partial values (eg. subsets).

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; there was a thread on the Google's Titan group about using Riak with Titan. 
&gt; Matthias (one of the lead developers) initial response was that Riak's data 
&gt; model was difficult to work with for their use case.
&gt; When I asked him about the new 2.0 data types he answered the following
&gt; 
&gt; "Sets seem close to what we need. At least that will allow us to do atomic 
&gt; edge operations. Is it possible to specify a sort order on those sets and 
&gt; retrieve subsets or can I only retrieve the set as a whole?"
&gt; 
&gt; Since I could not find the information, I am hoping somebody here will be 
&gt; able to help out.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Bernie
