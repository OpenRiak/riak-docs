Also, while LevelDB appears to be largely an append only format, the
documentation currently does not recommend live backups, presumably because
there are some issues that can crop up if restoring a DB that was not
cleanly shutdown.

I am guessing those issues are the ones documented as edge cases here:
https://github.com/basho/leveldb/wiki/repair-notes

That said, it looks like as of 1.4 those are largely cleared up, at least
from what I gather from that page, and that one must only ensure that data
is copied in a certain order and that you run the LevelDB repair algorithm
when retiring the files.

So is the backup documentation on LevelDB still correct? Will Basho will
enable hot backups on LevelDB backends any time soon?

&gt; The Riak documentation backup page is completely silent on Riak Search and

&gt; And looking forward, what is the backup strategy for Yokozuna? Will it
&gt; make use of Solr's Replication Handler, or something more lower level?
&gt; Will the node need to be offline to backup it up?
