As we've mentioned earlier, the 1.0.2 release of Riak is coming soon.
Like we did with Riak 1.0.0, we are provided a release candidate for test
before we release 1.0.2 final.

You can find the packages here:
http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-1.0.2rc1/

The release notes have been updated and can be found here:
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.0/RELEASE-NOTES.org

Thank you, as always, for continuing to provide bug reports and feedback.

-Jared
