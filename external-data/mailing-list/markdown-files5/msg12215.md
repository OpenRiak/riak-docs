Hello,

We are trying to deploy Riak software for testing purposes, with Java
client; however after compilation riak return following massage. 

Java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused

Operations system is CentOS, riak is installed with yum, and for now I'm
trying to run single node (so I'm starting it by /etc/init.d/riak
start). I've tried to check riak activity with Netstat, but didn't found
any application using port 8098, which I believe is supposed to belong
to riak when it's running. 

 

Thanks you,

Victor
