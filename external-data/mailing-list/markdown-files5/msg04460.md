&gt; Well i don't really care if it opens in a browser properly or not. The python
&gt; Riak client is returning this error so something is wrong. When I run it in
&gt; the command line it returns a json object but im still getting that error.

I would play around with this using the python interpreter. Instead of calling 
my\\_bucket.get(key), I would use my\\_bucket.get\\_binary(key). This will give you 
the raw string stored in Riak instead of auto-decoding it. Inspect the result; 
make sure it does indeed look like valid json. If it does, I'd run it through 
the stdlib json.loads and see what happens.

&gt; Where do you set the application type header, are you talking about the
&gt; bucket object, the object itself or is it something that is set on the riak
&gt; server itself?

It's an attribute of the object itself. It's set by default to 
"application/json" as long as you are creating standard Riak objects and not 
Riak binaries. See 
http://basho.github.com/riak-python-client/tutorial.html#storing-keys-values 
for more detail.
