Hi,

We are having problems with the io on one of our amazon instances being
very slow for short periods of time. When this happens we get some put
timeouts even though all the other amazon instances seems to be fine. I
have done some investigations here: https://gist.github.com/anha0825/5866757.
Could anyone confirm this or point me in a better direction?

Thanks!
Andreas
