Hi Julio,

Thanks for reaching out.


Can you please let us know a bit more about your use case? For example, how
many nodes in your Riak cluster and what is your total data size? How many
Spark workers you launch? What is your results size? We can probably
provide better answer given this info.

About timing - we have Riak Spark Connector almost ready. It will arrive
initially as part of commercial offering, a bit later we plan to release it
as open source (without enterprise-only features). Commercial version
should be released in coming week or two, open-source should happen pretty
soon after that, but can not commit on the date.

Is your project for your company or it is for personal/noncommercial use?

Thanks,
Pavel
