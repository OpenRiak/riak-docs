I've now finished the tutorial. It's here: 
https://github.com/lenary/riak\\_crdt\\_cookbook/blob/master/counters/README.md

Thank you to everyone who helped out with testing it as I went along, and to 
Russell Brown and Sean Cribbs for their help with writing it.

There is also a Reference of the HTTP Counters API here: 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/apis/http/HTTP-Counters/
