Hello Ghouls and Gals,

This weekend I offer you a bit of light reading from our Riak Users email
archive (always available, rarely deletable!) Also, between raiding the
kids’ M&M’s and Skittles, make time to bone up on your Riak skills with
some new courses at the Basho Academy [0]. For those not in the know, we’re
continuously adding quick, self paced tutorials on various Riak related
topics to the Basho Academy. If there is something you think could use some
extra attention let us know and we’ll make it happen.

Are you working on something Riak related? Reply to this missive and I’ll
get your talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap. Perhaps you’re
interested in penning a guest post on the Basho blog? [1]


## Announcements


 -

 Introducing two new training modules on Basho Academy:
 -

 Riak KV: Operations Intro [2]
 -

 Riak TS: Spark Riak Connector [3]



## Basho for Business

Let’s assume you use Riak. We want to help you get the most out of it. The
Basho for Business section of the Riak Recap will highlight ways that Basho
can help you do just that.

Did you know that Basho offers Open Source support [4] and professional
services [5] such as developer and operations training? We do, it’s true.
If you've been considering licensing Riak, our sales staff are great people
to work with and can help you get the licenses you need at a price that
works. For example, we offer reduced pricing for startups. If you're
interested in hearing more, with no pressure or obligation, drop us your
details [6] and we'll have someone reach out to answer your questions. Hey,
you might get to talk to me!


## Jobs at Basho

our community with theirs? We’re hiring, here are a few of our open
positions. Check out the rest [7].

 -

 Developer Advocate EMEA (London) [9].
 -

 Developer Advocate (US) [10].
 -

(Yes, we are remote friendly.)


## Recently Answered


 -

 Brandon Martin is interested in figuring out how to use map/reduce in
 the Erlang client when using bucket types [12]. Basho engineer Luke Bakken
 replies with some recommendations and examples! [13]
 -

 Damion Junk is looking for guidance on running KV use cases alongside TS
 use cases in Riak TS cluster [14]. The official party line from Basho's
 John Daily at this time is that although you can do it, Basho does not
 currently support it and recommends you split the functionality into two
 clusters, KV and TS [15][16]. Damien Krotkine joins the conversation to
 report his experience in when doubling up use cases in Riak TS [17]. And I
 find it interesting that the Dami{o|e}n's have a Levenshtein distance [18]
 of 1.
 -

 Travis Kirstine has a question on whether or not the Riak claimant node
 has higher load than its peers [19]. Magnus Kessler informs us that it does
 not [20].
 -

 AJAX DoneBy Jack (who does AJAX) is interested in knowing how to specify
 query fields (qf) in a Solr query via the Riak Java Client. Basho's Magnus
 Kessler [21] and Fred Dushin [22] let us know that when communicating with
 Riak over protobuf there is no easy way to add certain Solr parameters.
 Nevertheless Alex Moore [23] shows us a way to do this by piggybacking the
 qf param in the {!dismax} block.
 -

 Joe Olson brings us a question on max quantum[24] range when querying in
 Riak TS [25]. John Daily adds some clarity [26]. For the uninitiated, Riak
 TS will execute a range query against a maximum number of quanta
 (configurable) [27][28].
 -

 In answering Rohit Sanbhadti question [29] on webmachine/mochiweb
 sockets, Luke Bakken lets us know that there is currently no way to
 dynamically modify mochiwebs max connections [30]. An increasing listen()
 backlog is generally symptomatic of not being able to handle increased load.
 -

 AJAX DoneBy Jack is back with a question [31] on Riak Explorer [32] and
 SSL. Magnus Kessler lets us know that Riak Explorer hasn't quite figured
 out how to speak SSL yet [33].



## Open Discussions


 -

 Ricardo Mayerhofer is experiencing node crashes [34] in his cluster.
 Ricardo, any update?
 -

 Lingesh is getting an error when starting Riak and enabling AAE due to
 100% i/o utilization [35].
 -

 Following up on previous Solr query, cursor mark and coverage plan
 discussions, Guillaume Boddaert opens a new line of questioning around
 tuning the coverage plan itself [36].



Have a spooktacular weekend,
