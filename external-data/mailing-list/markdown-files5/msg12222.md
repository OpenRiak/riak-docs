Recently my Riak nodes started returning errors local\\_put\\_failed. It
happens on many nodes.

Half of my nodes are Riak 1.3.1, half upgraded 1.3.2 (this setup worked for
more than a month without any problems).

I found in
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/recovery/errors/
that this can be somehow related to LevelDB memory and node restart is
recommended.

The problem is that it happens on many nodes. Should I restart all of them
and will it actually solve the problem (I'm afraid it will just appear
again later)?

I've run risk-admin diag -- nothing. Looked at the riak logs on all nodes
-- nothing except ALIVE.

Why this error happens and how to solve this issue?
