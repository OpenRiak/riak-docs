Hi All,

join a new host C to the cluster but here is the problem..
 Host C has huge data which is not part of any cluster...I populated
its data by taking backup from basho bitcask backups...It
 worked fine with ut any problem...now I want to join this host C to
my cluster with out losing the data from Host C....

 Please help me on the above..

Thanks,
