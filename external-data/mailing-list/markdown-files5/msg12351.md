Hi Matt,

I've asked around and there doesn't seem to be much of a performance
difference between the two. Unix timestamps were recommended due to
the simplicity of doing range queries (like Matthew Dawson suggested)
as well as storage size. Just use UTC and you'll be set.

&gt; Hey list.

&gt; A quick question on best practices really:
&gt;
&gt; Should I use a bin index with ISO8601 format?
&gt; Or should I use an Unix timestamp as an integer index?
&gt; Is there likely to be a performance difference? (There will certainly be
&gt; storage size difference).
&gt; Has anyone had an specific success with either approach?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
