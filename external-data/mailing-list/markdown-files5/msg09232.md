I apologize for the confusion here(shouldn't hit listserves at 6am). I'm
talking about the python client for riak and refering to the to methods
populate and set\\_sublings found
https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/blob/master/riak/riak\\_object.py#L526and
https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/blob/master/riak/riak\\_object.py#L621
A note to non-python people when I say private I don't mean actually
private, its simply a convention the community uses to denote that its
either likely to change version to version or if handled improperly can
easily cause the class to behave improperly.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I've noticed afew questions on the list serve over the past year. Allot
&gt; of people have asked questions about how/why they should use populate.
&gt; Mostly its because its exposed in the docs without much explanation. Along
&gt; with set\\_siblings and some other number of methods in riak\\_objects.py, many
&gt; methods which are likely to be only used internally to the class and not
&gt; marked with a preceding \\_ which is part of pep 8 here
&gt; http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#method-names-and-instance-variables
&gt; Sphinx(http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html) should handle this
&gt; properly and hide the methods from users who will not need to look that
&gt; deeply.
&gt; Its a quick sed command for me to fix and fork this, is there a specific
&gt; reason why these are not made "private" and if not what other methods do
&gt; you all think should be included in this off the RiakObject itself?
