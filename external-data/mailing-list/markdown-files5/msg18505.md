It \\_really\\_ needs doing. And a whole host of people have said theyâ€™re keen to 
work on it.

Ted Burghart did a lot of work on this at Basho (talk here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcUTsYjEon4) and of course Heinz Gies has made 
riak\\_core\\_ng available for some time.

At least 3 organisations have expressed a willingness to do the work, and as 
much as I hate meetings, I think we need to talk to get organised to get this 
done, rather than each org/individual attacking alone.

I hate Wednesdays almost as much as I hate meetings, so how does 1700 GMT, 
Wednesday 7th February sound?

Cheers

Russell
