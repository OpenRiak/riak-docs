The setup/installation doesn't seem to survive a reboot or restart. What
needs to be added so that I have a "permanent" cluster that restarts riak
with the OS restarts and reforms the cluster when any node of the cluster
finally comes up?

 

 

Thanks again.

If this request for clarification falls on the right ears I have two more
requests:

 

Could some clarification in the instructions be made for the statement:

 

riak-admin cluster plan

If this looks good:

 

It is unclear to me and maybe other beginners what 'good' looks like.

 

Also:

 

Load test data

Execute on any one of the nodes:

curl -s http://rekon.basho.com | sh

Visit DNS address listed on the dashboard, at the port we opened as an
endpoint:

http://testlinuxvm.cloudapp.net:8098/riak/rekon/go

 

We just loaded test data onto one of the Azure nodes. Was this necessary?
What did it do? What "tests" does the web page run? Is this kind of a
'ping'?

 

Thank you for your patience.
