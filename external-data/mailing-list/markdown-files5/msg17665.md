Hello Gang,


For your perusing this weekend we’ve got a few announcements along with the
always informative mailing list recap. New bits to download while you enjoy
fall weather (not if you live in Texas though…)


As always, let us know your thoughts: If you’re working on or speaking
about something Riak related and would like a mention, let me know. I’ll
get your talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap. I know a guy.


## Announcements

 Conference [6] entitled “From NoSQL to Mo' SQL - Adding Structure and

 Ricardo Mayerhofer want to process data from Riak KV with Amazon ML by

 us that Riak KV does not support full bucket scan natively but recommends
 Riak TS or a 2i index in KV [25].
 -

 Sean McEvoy is interested in searching strings with spaces in them [26].
 Not entirely as trivial as one would hope [27] [28].

 Weixi Yen writes in with an issue with multiple copies of an object
 getting returned in Solr queries [31]. This is what happens when you query
 the Solr nodes directly [32]. Don’t do that :(

 limit Erlangs dist ports is in riak.conf [39].
 -

 coverage plan to a query [41].
