Hi Russel,

No, it doesn't depend. It's always a new value.

Best regards

&gt; If I guarantee that the same key is only written with a 5 second interval,
&gt; is last\\_write\\_wins=true profitable?

&gt;
&gt; It depends. Does the value you write depend in anyway on the value you
&gt; read, or is it always that you are just getting a totally new value that
&gt; replaces what is in Riak (regardless what is in Riak)?

&gt;&gt; Hi there everyone!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would like to know, if my current application is a good use case to set
&gt;&gt; last\\_write\\_wins to true.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Basically I have a cluster of node.js workers reading and writing to
&gt;&gt; riak. Each node.js worker is responsible for a set of keys, so I can
&gt;&gt; guarantee some kind of non distributed cache...
&gt;&gt; The real deal here is that the writing operation is not run evertime an
&gt;&gt; object is changed but each 5 seconds in a "batch insertion/update" style.
&gt;&gt; This brings the guarantee that the same object cannot be write to riak at
&gt;&gt; the same time, not event at the same seconds, there's always a 5 second
&gt;&gt; window between each insertion/update.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That said, is it profitable to me if I set last\\_write\\_wins to true? I've
&gt;&gt; been facing some massive writting delays under high loads and it would be
&gt;&gt; nice if I have some kind of way to tune riak.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot and keep up the good work!
&gt;&gt;
