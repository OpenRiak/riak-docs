Maybe what you are looking for is a combination of both, say, your KV 
data in Riak with a combination of background processes able to build 
the necessary searching graphs in Neo4J, in such way your data is secure 
in a Riak cluster and searchable on several Neo4J servers.


That's just an idea which might be not do-able, hope it helps,

Guido.

Hi there,

For some time already I have in mind building a kind of social network 
myself. Is pretty ambitious project although it doesn't have in mind 
to be a new facebook; but still data will be quite big and complex.


I like Riak and I had been following since version 0.14, and new 
additions in Riak 2.0 seem to help a lot in how to model the data; 
although relationships will be unavoidable.


Some friends suggested me to use Graph Databases instead. How would 
Riak compare to Graph Databases for this use case? Is it doable to 
create a social network entirely from Riak? Or may not be recommended?


Thanks!
Alex
