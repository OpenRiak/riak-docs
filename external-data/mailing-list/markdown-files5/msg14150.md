Hi all,

It would be good to see the state of JavaScript MapReduce on Riak improve.

erlang\\_js [1], which is used for JavaScript MapReduce, is using
an antiquated version of SpiderMonkey that is missing tens of features and
significant performance improvements. E.g., Object.getOwnPropertyNames(),
Function.bind().

There is a pull request to attempt to update it to a more recent old
version [2].

I think it would be interesting to get Google's V8 [3] running as a Riak
MapReduce back-end. Some Erlang wrappers for v8 already exist [4].

Does anyone have any guidance or insight how one would go about writing a
v8 Riak MapReduce backend ?

Thanks!

Isaac
