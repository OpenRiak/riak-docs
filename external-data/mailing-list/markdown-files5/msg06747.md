&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not convinced that a CAS operation is inevitably subject to data races.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are proven techniques for avoiding races at the cost of latency,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which is acceptable in certain situations.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct, but as far as I know, there is no way to build a CAS system
&gt;&gt;&gt; on top of the primitives provided by the Riak public API. You need
&gt;&gt;&gt; a point of serialization amongst all of the replicas (for a particular key),
&gt;&gt;&gt; which Riak does not provide, for availability reasons.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think a point of serialization is not needed here. It should be sufficient
&gt;&gt; to add a new internal API for nodes to handle a two-phase commit, and
&gt;&gt; then the transaction coordinator (running on whatever node you make
&gt;&gt; the request to) can contain the logic to carry out the transaction.
&gt; If I understand you correctly, the "transaction coordinator" would
&gt; be a point of serialization.

Not a global point of serialization, other transactions would be unaffected.
It is my understanding that there is a new transaction coordinator for
each client request. So it is already always "serial" in a sense.
