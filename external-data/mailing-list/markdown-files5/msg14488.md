I thought the general idea floating in my ignorant mind can help. We have
other storage systems apart from S3 like FTPS, HTTPS etc. I thought the
task of crawling remote storage systems and processing files naturally lent
itself to distributed MR jobs and a DFS.

That is when I came across Riak CS.

Thanks,
Mohan

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I came across the storage system discussion thread. We have a
&gt; requirement to download thousands of files from S3 for processing. Ours is
&gt; not a cloud storage system but a cloud access system.
&gt;
&gt; Are there qualities of Riak CS that can help us ? We want to download
&gt; part of a huge file and checkpoint if the connection breaks. File downloads
&gt; should be fault-tolerant when nodes go down.
&gt;
&gt; Please bear with me if my question is basic. I don't work with distributed
&gt; cloud storage systems.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
