&gt; If you've installed from the apt/yum repository you've installed a single

&gt; going to write to a different server via hinted handoff[1]. Since you are 
&gt; only running one node, that single node receives all copies of your data in 
&gt; the hopes that some day the other Riak servers in the cluster will come back 
&gt; for their data.

This isn't quite true. A single node cluster is just going to simply store 
three copies on 3 of its local vnodes. No hinted handoff is involved. If you 
add nodes to the cluster, as Evan said, data will be distributed amongst them.

Ben,

tl;dr, Riak will store three copies on your data, by default, even if you're 
using a single server.
