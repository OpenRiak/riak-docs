Hello, I'm trying to do some test with a riak consist of 8 nodes. I tried
to leave a node from the cluster, and I can see the ownership handoff
through ring-status.But when I tried to remove a node, such process didn't
occur.I have several questions about node-leaving and node-removing.Please
tell me the answers if U know, thanks a lot!
1. After I leave a node from the cluster, it takes several hours before the
ownership handoff finishes, and another hours before the nodes repartition
finishes.During this time, is the cluster available for reading and writing?
2. I saw nothing like repartition happened between nodes still in the
cluster through ring-status command after a node removed, what will happen
to make the ring works well (I mean, operations like filling the lost
copies on the removed node) , if there are such processes, how can I
observe them? Is the cluster available for reading and writing before they
finish?
