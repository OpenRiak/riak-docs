Never mind. I found the archive search page and this same question posted 
earlier here:

Subject: mapreduce with non-existent keys

I’ve got a set of bucket/key pairs that may contain items that no longer exist 
in riak. Is it possible to pass that to map/reduce and explicitly tell riak to 
ignore any pairs which aren’t current, ie: which aren’t found? For example, if 
I have compiled a list of pairs but before passing the list, one or more of 
those items was removed from the database, then my map/reduce appears to fail 
since it doesn’t find the referenced item. Can riak be told to ignore such 
missing items if they are incurred?

Thanks.

Mark
