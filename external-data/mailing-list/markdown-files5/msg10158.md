Hi all,

I'm writing a new Scala (http) client library for Riak [1] and I ran into some 
trouble with special characters while implementing 2i. 

Reading through the docs, all the 2i examples are for simple one-word index 
names but I have not been able to find any rules about index names and values 
containing spaces, commas, and other special characters and how the HTTP api 
deals with encoding and decoding these?

My unit tests use the following troublesome corner cases:

- index values containing spaces
- index names containing spaces
- index values containing commas

I tried a number of approaches and none of them work for all three:

1) Don't encode the index names or the values when creating "x-riak-index-" 
http headers but encode both the name and the value in the URL used to fetch by 
an index

This works fine for values containing spaces but creates illegal headers for 
index names containing spaces and breaks for values containing commas (the 
values get split into two).

2) Encode everything

This creates valid headers and storing index values containing commas now works 
fine. The only trouble is that index fetching fails whenever there are spaces, 
commas or other encoded characters involved.

Could anyone enlighten me about the correct way to deal with these cases?

Regards,
Age
