There was also a discussion not too long ago about using SSDs with Riak on this 
mailing list. I remember they talked about how to choose your SSDs wisely among 
other things.

Now you know,

Ämne: mixing SSD and regular drives a/k/a mixing slower and faster nodes

Hi all,

we just had a client ask for SSD drives - we're wondering if there are issues 
mixing riak nodes for a while - 3 nodes w/regular drives, 1 w/SSD - the 1 w/SSD 
will be significantly faster I have no doubt - has anyone had issues with doing 
this? I don't want to migrate all nodes at once for stability/uptime reasons... 
but i don't want to create a stability problem trying to avoid one : )

Best,
