Hi Jeff,

You can modify the location of the data and log files by editing the
appropriate entries in app.config

Changing the location of app.config and vm.args would involve modifying the
lib/env.sh file to change the value of RUNNER\\_ETC\\_DIR.

As you said, this may introduce other issues since it's untested and
unsupported, but there's no harm in trying it out to see for yourself.

&gt; Are there any specific changes that I could make to lib/env.sh that would
