I have filed to find code that would create a bucket. It must be in the past
I have just put objects into a bucket and Riak must construct the bucket if
it does not exist. Now I would like to create the bucket and set some
properties on that bucket. But I don't know how to create the bucket.

 

So I have code like:

 

 BuildProduct(source, destination);

 RiakObject value = new RiakObject("products",
keySku, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(destination))

 {

 ContentType = "application/json"

 };

 

 RiakResult response =
client.Put(value, new RiakPutOptions { W = 2 });

 

But I would like to create the bucket and set properties on the bucket
before I put things into the bucket. Like:

 

 RiakResult riakBuckpropertiesResult =
client.GetBucketProperties("products", true);

 if (riakBuckpropertiesResult.IsSuccess)

 {

 riakBuckpropertiesResult.Value

 .SetNVal(4)

 .SetAllowMultiple(true)

 .SetWVal("all")

 .SetRVal("quorum");

 client.SetBucketProperties("products",
riakBuckpropertiesResult.Value);

 }

 

The problem is that the properties that I want to set are for a bucket that
doesn't exist yet so the "get" fails.
