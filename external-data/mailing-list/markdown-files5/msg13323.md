Hello,

Have been using Riak in our current project, one of the things that I felt
missing while debugging was a good command line tool to quickly query riak
(other than using CURL with all those REST APIs).

So, thought will give it a shot to simplify the querying usage a bit using
a command line tool
(https://github.com/katta/riakcli
)

Its just a basic version of it, lots more could be added to this tool. Just
thought will get some suggestions or ideas from this group.

Let me know if you have any suggestions.
