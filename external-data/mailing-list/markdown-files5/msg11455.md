Riak Users,

As was somewhat hinted at by the apt/yum repo update, we are happy to
announce the release of Riak 1.4.0.

A blog post giving a high level overview of the release can be found here:
http://basho.com/basho-announces-availability-of-riak-1-4/

Does that mention counters? I believe it does Bob.

The complete release notes can be found here:
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.4/RELEASE-NOTES.md

Lastly, the downloads can be found on our docs page:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/downloads/

Thanks so much to everyone in the community who use our product, give us
feedback, and also help other users on this mailing list.

-Team Basho
