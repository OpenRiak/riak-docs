If you're running a single-node Riak instance to start with (such as a
prototype web app), but there's the possibility of expanding the cluster
and adding other nodes, you should run with n\\_val=3. (It's not recommended
to change the ring size in mid-stream).

If you're only running a single node, and don't plan on adding other nodes
ever, then yes, set the n\\_val=1.
Tom is right, though, a single node Riak instance does remove any fault
tolerance and high availability advantages that Riak gives.
(Oh, the other value to change, if you -know- you're going to be running 1
node only, is go with a smaller ring size. I'd go with 8 or 16, depending
on how beefy your server is).

&gt; Is there anything that speaks against doing so? I'm thinking that in
&gt; such a setup, nVal should be set to 1 - everything else makes no
&gt; sense, right? Would you also set the ring-size to 1?
