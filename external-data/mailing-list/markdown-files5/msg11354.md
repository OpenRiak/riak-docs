Hi all,

I have been using Riak now for about 5 months and I have really been
enjoying it. However there is one thing that has been kind of bothering me
and I was hoping to hear from others on how they handle this.

As my system continues to grow in both scale and complexity, documentation
is becoming an even greater necessity. I have been wondering if anyone had
any best practices or examples for diagramming and documenting a NoSQL
based solution (specifically Riak)?

In my project I am making use of Secondary Indexes(SI) and my data stored
is well structured (in that I am storing compressed erlang records).
 Recently, others have started to join in and I would really like an easy
to explain set of documentation to help them get started quickly.

I have explored using UML but it is hard to express the bucket/key concept
as well as show off how the SI associates data together.


Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

-Chris
