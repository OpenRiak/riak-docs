Riak Reacp for Nov. 17 - 19

1) Sean Cribbs made some enhancements to Ripple and improved the state
of Jruby support.

Info here ---&gt; http://twitter.com/#!/seancribbs/status/5042296189878273

2) Jebu Ittiachen (@jebui), who has written some great posts about his
use of Riak in the past, just authored a new post called
"Searching with RiakSearch." This is a solid overview of what Riak
Search is all about and how he is using it at inagist.com. Definitely
worth the read.

3) Looks like J. Brisbin has almost finished building in support for
Riak in Grails!

4) benblack pointed out that the "riak glossary wiki page does not
define 'Quorum.' " (via #riak)

We've added 'Quorum' to the Glossary on the wiki ---&gt;

5) Q --- What exactly are string vclock values? If two objects have
the same vclock string, I presume they have the same antecedents?
(from aphyr via #riak)

 A --- If they have the same vclock, they are the same object
(assuming bucket/key are the same).

6) Q --- Is there a command some place to list all buckets? (from
sh1mmer via #riak)

 A --- Info on listing buckets via the PBC API can be found here:
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/PBC+API .

There is also a soon-to-be-merged branch of riak\\_kv that will make it
possible to list buckets via the HTTP API. Have a look at the latest
commit in this branch :
