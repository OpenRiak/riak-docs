Hey All,

I just wanted to give everyone a heads up that the next installment of the
next installment of the Community Release Notes [1] are almost wrapped up.
I'll be tagging tomorrow and probably be releasing on Monday. If we're
missing something you think should be on here, don't hesitate to fork the
repo and make your contribution known. (There is some background on the
Community Release Notes on the Basho Blog [2] for those of you who aren't
yet familiar.)

Thanks. Let me know if you have any questions.
