Given your scenario, it seems that a portion of these writes would have 
MapReduce jobs that resulted in nothing happening — I assume you only
bucket the series every so many writes or time period, correct?

I’d highly recommend doing this externally, or identifying a method for
pre-bucket’ing the data given the rate of ingestion.
