The Riak documentation makes it sound like you should only add one node to
a running cluster at the same time.

Is it wise to add multiple nodes to a cluster at the same time?

What cluster considerations should I take into account before doing so?

I can see this being very problematic with a 5 node cluster, but less
problematic with a much larger cluster since a smaller percentage of nodes
will participate in the hand off.
