Ah thanks Brian, that's good to know!

&gt; In addition to Jeremiah's suggestions I would suggest using single character

&gt; in bitcask has its bucket prepended onto its entry in the in-memory keydir.
&gt; So using "d" as a bucket name instead of "data" saves at least 3 bytes per
&gt; key.

&gt; Thanks for all the great questions!
