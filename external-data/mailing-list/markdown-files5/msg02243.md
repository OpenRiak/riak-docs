It looks like your problem is that the code is not on the server, so yes, ... I 
think that your guess is right. Here's a blg I wrote a while back on this topic

http://www.javalimit.com/2010/05/passing-funs-to-other-erlang-nodes.html

... which also describes why it works for the case where you enter the code in 
the shell; it creates an interpreted function structure which \\*is\\* usable 
across erlang nodes.

If I copy the function body, line for line into the erlang shell, replacing 
values as I go along, the code works fine, and I get results back correctly.

However, If I call the function, in the same shell, I get the following error:

{error,&lt;&lt;"{error,\\n {error,undef,\\n 
[{#Fun,\\n 
[{r\\_object,&lt;&lt;\\"family\\"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"...&gt;&gt;}

This is not what I expected to happen. Has this got something to do with the 
nature of the anonymous function, one being defined in the shell and the other 
in a module? I've seen this link:
