I'm using basho/leveldb as of
commit: 532bb6351e7835e862c8508520780bfc9d0c2b78 (no snappy)

I have an issue with some small sized database... they claim corruption,
but when running a repair I have a nonsensical amount of sst's moved into
"lost"

Worse, the files moved to "lost" have very very old creation times (in
months). The system has been restarted successfully many times in the
interim, leading to more confusion.

I'm looking for pointers to get to the bottom of this. It isn't critical
thatI recover this data, but it is critical that I don't see this manifest
when it does matter.

Before repair:

40960 108441.log
1 CURRENT
0 LOCK
3 LOG
3 LOG.old
92 MANIFEST-108439
469 sst\\_0
1 sst\\_1
188185 sst\\_2
4189331 sst\\_3
6343660 sst\\_4
1 sst\\_5
1 sst\\_6

After repair:

40960 108452.log
1 CURRENT
0 LOCK
3 LOG
3 LOG.old
28 MANIFEST-108450
8221971 lost
2362 sst\\_0
1 sst\\_1
188185 sst\\_2
2352071 sst\\_3
1 sst\\_4
1 sst\\_5
1 sst\\_6
