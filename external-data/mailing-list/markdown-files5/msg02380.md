Hi Aditya,

There are no concepts of N, W, or R in Luwak. This is because Luwak is built 
\\_on top\\_ of Riak. To be more specific, Luwak takes a large file and chunks it 
into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are then hashed, and stored under a 
key equal to the hash value. That is, Luwak uses something called a hash tree 
to store data. This has the nice benefit that you don't take a storage hit for 
redundant data because Luwak files will share data they have in common. 
However, it has the drawback that deleting something is non-trivial, and 
currently Luwak does not actually remove the data when you delete a file.

If you want to change the N/W/R props of Luwak (as a whole) then you can do so 
by setting the luwak\\_node and luwak\\_tld bucket props appropriately.
