Is it possible that Bashoâ€™s recommendation on vm.swappiness is out of date?

The current recommendation (per 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/tuning/linux/) is still to set 
vm.swappiness to 0.

Based on 
https://www.percona.com/blog/2014/04/28/oom-relation-vm-swappiness0-new-kernel/ 
it appears that in kernel 3.5 and up, the behavior of vm.swappiness=0 was 
changed.

Due to that, should we modify our vm.swappiness to 1?

Thanks
