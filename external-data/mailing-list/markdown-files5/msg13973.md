Hi all.

Here's a simple scenario that we're planning to test: a cluster of 4
nodes, 2 are normal eleveldb'backend nodes and 2 are stored on RAM
(with same eleveldb backend).

We plan to use RAM nodes as a fast "frontend".


Question A:
RAM disks are completely volatile, so nodes will restart with no data stored.
So, what will happen at restart? If a Riak node is restarted in a
"clean" state (no data, same state as it was on creation), will it
receive the state from disk nodes? Or it's required to re-add it to
cluster?

Question B: due to huge speed difference between on-disk and on-RAM
backend, should any replication side-effects be expected?

Quesion C: should we use memory\\_backend + leveldb\\_backend nodes
together instead of building that? Does Riak networking topology
allows for mixed backends?
