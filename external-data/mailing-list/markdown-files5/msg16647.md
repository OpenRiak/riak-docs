Hi

Our attach script failed and it only issued \\*cluster join\\*
but not \\*cluster plan\\* and \\*cluster commit\\*.
so the node was visible as joining in member\\_status

Since then both part (original cluster and new node) were taking writes but
in our configuration each node takes writes from it local process (no load
balancing etc)

I've checked content of both parts and it looks like riak db is in sync i.e.
new node can see data that were stored on original cluster. Am I right
assuming join is enough and cluster is seen as a whole?

What are the consequences on not running plan & commit?
What would cancel do in this scenario?

Also is it safe to issue those to and finish process?

Regards
Daniel
