I've been running Riak in 32bit environments (FreeBSD 8/i386, Ubuntu
12.10/x86), but in either case, I build from the source. I think Describing
the tuning requirement and other caveats in the docs.basho.com site will
be sufficient for the users who have to use Riak on the 32bit environments.

&gt; So why get rid of it in the first place? 32bit machines / vm's have a hard
&gt; 2G limit on memory. This limit can cause problems with our backends which
&gt; store keys (in bitcask's case) and cache (in eleveldb's case) in memory.
&gt; You can tune each of these backends to work in constrained environments,
&gt; but requiring manual tuning of the `app.config` before you even start your
&gt; first node doesn't exactly fit our "Ops Friendy" goal we strive to achieve.
&gt; 
&gt; So, is anyone out there running Riak in a 32bit environment? Will you be
&gt; extremely unhappy if 1.3 is the last release to have supported packages
&gt; built?
