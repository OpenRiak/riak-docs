Hi Mikhail,

We took the liberty of creating the docs before the actual AMI was approved
(though we expected it to be available by now).

That said, sit tight. It should be approved very soon.

&gt; As I can see there is a AMI for Riak

&gt; But I can not find any Riak's AMI in AWS Market Place.
&gt;
&gt; What I do wrong?
&gt;
&gt; Where is it?

&gt; Best,
