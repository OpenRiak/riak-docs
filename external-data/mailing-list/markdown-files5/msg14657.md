Hi,

So I'm writing a Java client app. I'm running a 5 node Riak cluster and I want 
my client to know about all the nodes to avoid single points of failure.

So, I load a config file with the node addresses in, and configure a 
PBClusterConfig instance with a number of PBClientConfig instances, one for 
each node in the config file.

All's well :)

Now I want to add some new nodes to the cluster. How does the client get 
informed about these additional nodes?

In my current implementation I'd have to restart the clients with an update 
config file detailing the new nodes. This seems inelegant to me. Is there a 
best practice for automatically updating clients when new nodes are added to a 
cluster?

Thanks,

Simon.
