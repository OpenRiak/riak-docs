Hi all,
Is it possible to adjust the number of replicas Riak-CS keeps of every object 
(I'd like to only keep two copies)? 

I've read the documentation and the default number of replicas seems to be 
three, but there doesn't seem to be any config in Riak-CS to change it. If I 
changed the n\\_val in the default bucket properties of the Riak cluster, would 
this have the effect of changing the number of replicas?

Here's the only comment I could find in the docs about how many replicas are 
kept. The language implies it's possible to change the number, but I can find 
no reference to any config settings in the open source or enterprise versions:
In Riak CS, large objects are broken into blocks and streamed to the underlying 
Riak cluster on write, where they are replicated for high availability (3 
replicas by default). 
(http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/MDC-Overview/).


Thanks,
Tom
