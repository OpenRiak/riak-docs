Hi Dear basho team,

For project use I’ve implemented riak 2.0 api for twisted(only pbc support,http 
not ported yet,but should much more simple to port, CRDT currently is not 
really to use via http), currently CRUD/search and most apis needed were 
implemented and demonstrative tested, don’t know what kind of unit test should 
I take anymore here, if anybody would like to test it or any more suggestions I 
would be really appreciated :)

Here is the repo.
https://github.com/eminarcissus/riakasaurus/tree/2.0\\_beta

Also notice I still cannot remove search index even I changed bucket property 
of search\\_index to \\_dont\\_index\\_ , don’t know if there’s anything I missed here.

Both the performance and functionality provided by 2.0 is extremely impressive, 
thanks very much basho team, you save my days XD
