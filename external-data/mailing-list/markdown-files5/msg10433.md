I am relatively new to Riak so forgive me if this has been asked before. I
have a very thin understanding of a Riak cluster and understand somewhat
about replication. In planning I foresee a time when the amount of data
exceeds the disk space that is available to a single node. What facilities
are there to essentially "split" a bucket across several servers? How is
this handled?
