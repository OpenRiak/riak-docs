&gt; It all seems pretty straight forward, but the docs.basho.com page does not

&gt; not
&gt; sure if it's something you do only when you are using secondary indexes or
&gt; what? If it doesn't hurt to run regardless, then I have no problem doing
&gt; so.

&gt; Assuming I make a backup of /data (which contains the following: bitcask
&gt; kv\\_vnode mr\\_queue ring ssl\\_distribution.args\\_file)
&gt;
&gt;
Since you are only using bitcask it is not necessary to run "riak-admin
reformat-indexes". Running it would have no effect but you can safely skip
it. I've gone ahead and filed an issue about the missing docs [1]. More
information, for now, can be found in the release notes [2].
