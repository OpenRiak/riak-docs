Hi @list,

is it possible to reduce the n\\_val? I mean you can change it but what
happens then?

- is old data removed or is it laying around? (or maybe deleted after
 some time thanks to AAE?)

- is it causing problems like:
 - reducing n\\_val from 3 to 2
 - update data
 - sleep 10minutes
 - read data but second primary is borked =&gt; is the first fallback
 vnode on the place where the 3rd n\\_val vnode was before? So is this
 reading old crappy data (maybe the vclock is rescuing there but
 that's only one edge case I can think off right now)?

Cheers
Simon
