&gt; Out of curiosity, are you using search as a secondary index mechanism? Â If
&gt; so you should know that Riak has built-in secondary index support for 1.0
&gt; where you can add tags to your objects.

Speaking of secondary indexes vs. search: whenever querying, it seems
that there is no direct way to do OR/AND operations on multiple
secondary indexes. I am wondering if there is any work around to do
that kind of logic?

For certain fields I am still using riak\\_search indexing because I'd
like to query based on 2 secondary fields.
