I was digging through list archives and noticed a few threads where
people were having trouble building FreeBSD on Riak. It probably makes
sense to have docs on the wiki that cover this.

Any brave souls who've done this successfully off of the latest
release want to take a stab at it and update the newly-created Wiki
issue accordingly [1].

Thanks -

Mark
