Is there a reason why you selected a range and not just the bucket and key
(in the example)? My concern is that I don't want to hard-code any
dependencies or fore-knowledge in the code if possible. Using a range
assumes that all of the keys are in the range. As I see it if you just
specify the bucket and key there is no "assumption". Right?

Oh, and an example can be found https://gist.github.com/peschkaj/4772825

...and fixed!

 

You can get this right now if you're adventurous and want to build
CorrugatedIron from source by grabbing the develop branch [1]. We have
several other issues to clean up and verify before we release CI 1.1.1 in
the next day or so. Or you can download it from [2] if you don't want to
build yourself and don't want to wait for NuGet. Once we put 1.1.1 to NuGet
we'll respond to this thread or email you directly.

 

I make no guarantees that the new DLL won't eat your hard drive or turn your
computer into a killer robot.

Good news! You've found a bug in CorrugatedIron. Because of index naming, we
muck index names to have a suffix of \\_bin or \\_int, depending on the index
type. This shouldn't be happening on $key, but it is. I'll create a github
issue and get that taken care of.

The name is "$keys"? Something like:

 

 using (IRiakEndPoint cluster =
RiakCluster.FromConfig("riakConfig"))

 {

 IRiakClient riakClient = cluster.CreateClient();

 RiakBucketKeyInput bucketKeyInput = new
RiakBucketKeyInput();

 bucketKeyInput.AddBucketKey(productBucketName, "$keys");

 RiakMapReduceQuery query = new RiakMapReduceQuery()

 .Inputs(bucketKeyInput)

 .MapJs(m =&gt; m.Name("Riak.mapValuesJson").Keep(true));

 RiakResult result =
riakClient.MapReduce(query);

 if (result.IsSuccess)

 {

It would be queried like any other index as an MR input. I'll create an
issue and will try to get this in some time in the next few days - no
promises, though.

I will read the other URLs that you mentioned. Thank you.

 

Would you mind giving a short example (preferably using CI) of the $keys
index?

They're both pretty crappy in terms of performance - they read all data off
of disk. If you're using LevelDB you can use the $keys index to pull back
just the keys that in a single bucket.

 

A better approach is to maintain a separate bucket - e.g. DocumentCount -
that is used for counting documents. Unfortunately, you can't guarantee
transactional consistency around counts in Riak today, so you'll want to
move maintaining the counts out of Riak and into something else. If you
search the list archives [1], you'll find that Redis has been mentioned as a
good way to solve this problem - counters are stored in Redis and flushed to
Riak on a regular schedule. Because of the lack of consistency (especially
around MapReduce operations), Riak isn't the best choice if you require
counters/aggregations to be stored in the database.

 

Once CRDTs [2] make it into mainstream Riak, you can make use of those data
structures to implement distributed counters in Riak.

Say I need to determine how many document there are in my database. For a
CorrugatedIron application I can do ListKeys and get the warning that it is
an expensive operation or I can do a MapReduce query. Which is the the least
expensive? Is there an option that I am missing?
