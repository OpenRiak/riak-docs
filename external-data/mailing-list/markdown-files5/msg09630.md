Hi,

I am using latest ubuntu release for 64.

I am writing to riak and i get no errors. Then again....given a key...,I
also get no data. Where did it go? How does one debug riak when you write
to riak..it looks like a success, get no data when get by key and get no
errors.

To start, I wrote to riak using this bucket. I am using the python api.

impression\\_bucket = client.bucket('impressions')
impression\\_bucket.set\\_n\\_val(2)
impression\\_bucket.set\\_dw(1)

worker\\_bucket = impression\\_bucket.new(id, data=qs)
print worker\\_bucket.store()

When I write I get thus object whic is my only idnication of success. I
even changed dw to 2.




When I query the key....I get nothing. So.....rather confused on how I can
write and the data is now lost.........

Yes...the buckets are the same for a write and a read. I print how the id
as key and data as value and all valid entries.


I have data stored on an external device. Data is stored in /data/riak and
riak is total permissions. In that dir I see these folders. kv\\_vnode
lost+found mr\\_queue.

Riak control looks 100% ok with all green lights

Only option I changed was {platform\\_data\\_dir, "/data/riak"}, in app.config.

Thanks
