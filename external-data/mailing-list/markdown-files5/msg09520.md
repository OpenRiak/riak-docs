Hi,

Apart from a single default value, is it possible for Riak Search to
search for a keyword across all fields in a document without having to
specify the field up front as a prefix in one's search term?

I'm guessing that one solution could be a post-commit hook which
recursively iterates over all fields and squashes them into a secondary
default value field - but since I know even less about Erlang and am just
starting out with Riak, I thought it prudent to see if there was a more
straightforward solution...

The use case is this:

We are providing an object + metadata store for users to deposit files and
any number of related fragments of structured JSON metadata. We are not
enforcing any metadata schema - and therefore can't know up-front any field
names - but would like the ability for a dumb keyword search from a website
to return references to the records they have deposited in
Riak. Essentially, providing a Google-like interface.

(As a side question, Is Riak Search mature enough for these type of very
generic searches? I know that it's "inspired by" Lucene and "Lucene-like",
but I don't know how many of Lucene's goodies are present - or is it just a
case of invoking analysers provided by Lucene for things like stemming, and
all will be pretty much equivalent for most situations?)
