Hi,
Would be good to know the riak version, and why the dvv\\_enabled bucket property 
is set to false, please? Also, is there multi-datacentre replication involved? 
Do you re-use your keys, for example, have the keys in question been created, 
deleted, and then re-created?

Cheers

Russell

&gt; I recently had another case of a disappearing object. This time the object 
&gt; was successfully PUT, and (unlike the previous cases reported in this thread) 
&gt; for a period of time GETs were also successful. Then GETs started 404ing for 
&gt; no apparent reason. There are no errors in the logs to indicate that anything 
&gt; unusual happened. This is quite disconcerting. Is it normal that Riak CS just 
&gt; loses track of objects? At this point we are using CS as primary object 
&gt; storage, meaning we do not have the data stored in another database so it's 
&gt; critical that the data is not randomly lost.
&gt; 
&gt; In the CS access logs I see
&gt; 
&gt; # all prior GET requests for this object succeeding like this one. This is 
&gt; the last successful GET request:
&gt; [28/Feb/2017:14:42:35 +0000] "GET 
&gt; /buckets/blobdb/objects/commcarehq\\_\\_apps%2F3d2b... HTTP/1.0" 200 14923 "" 
&gt; "Boto3/1.4.0 Python/2.7.6 Linux/3.13.0-86-generic Botocore/1.4.53 Resource"
&gt; ...
&gt; # all GET requests for this object are now failing like this one (the first 
&gt; 404):
&gt; [02/Mar/2017:08:36:11 +0000] "GET 
&gt; /buckets/blobdb/objects/commcarehq\\_\\_apps%2F3d2b... HTTP/1.0" 404 240 "" 
&gt; "Boto3/1.4.0 Python/2.7.6 Linux/3.13.0-86-generic Botocore/1.4.53 Resource"
&gt; 
&gt; The object name has been elided for readability. I do not know when this 
&gt; object was PUT into the cluster because I only have logs for the past month. 
&gt; Is there any way to dig further into Riak or Riak CS data to determine if the 
&gt; object content is actually completely lost or if there are any other details 
&gt; that might explain why it is now missing? Could I increase some logging 
&gt; parameters to get more information about what is going wrong when something 
&gt; like this happens?
&gt; 
&gt; I have searched the logs for other 404 responses but found none (other than 
&gt; the two reported earlier), so this is the 3rd known missing object in the 
&gt; cluster. We retain logs for one month only (I'm increasing this now because 
&gt; of this issue), so it is possible that other objects have also gone missing, 
&gt; but I cannot see them since the logs have been truncated.
&gt; 
&gt; The cluster now has 7 nodes instead of 9 (see earlier emails in this thread), 
&gt; and the riak storage backend is now leveldb instead of multi. I have attached 
&gt; config file templates for riak, raik-cs and stanchion (these are deployed 
&gt; with ansible).
&gt; 
&gt; Bucket properties:
&gt; {

&gt; I'll be happy to provide more context to help troubleshoot this issue.
&gt;

&gt; Hi Luke,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the late response and thanks for following up. I haven't seen it 
&gt; happen since. At this point I'm going to wait and see if it happens again and 
&gt; hopefully get more details about what might be causing it.

&gt; &gt; There is nothing unusual about the keys. The format is a name + UUID + some
&gt; &gt; other random URL-encoded charaters, like most other keys in our cluster.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are no errors near the time of the incident in any of the logs (the
&gt; &gt; last [error] is from over a month before). I see lots of messages like this
&gt; &gt; in console.log:

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Daniel -
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; This is a strange scenario. I recommend looking at all of the log
&gt; &gt;&gt; files for "[error]" or other entries at about the same time as these
&gt; &gt;&gt; PUTs or 404 responses.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Is there anything unusual about the key being used?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have a 9-node Riak CS cluster that has been working flawlessly for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about 3
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; months. The cluster configuration, including backend and bucket
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; parameters
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; such as N-value are using default settings. I'm using the S3 API to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; communicate with the cluster.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Within the past week I had an issue where two objects were PUT resulting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a 200 (success) response, but all subsequent GET requests for those two
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; keys
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; return status of 404 (not found). Other than the fact that they are now
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; missing, there was nothing out of the ordinary with these particular to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; PUTs. Maybe I'm missing something, but this seems like a scenario that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should never happen. All information included here about PUTs and GETs
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; comes
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; from reviewing the CS access logs. Both objects were PUT on the same
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; node,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; however GET requests returning 404 have been observed on all nodes.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; plenty of other traffic on the cluster involving GETs and PUTs that are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; failing. I'm unsure of how to troubleshoot further to find out what may
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happened to those objects and why they are now missing. What is the best
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; approach to figure out why an object that was successfully PUT seems to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; missing?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
