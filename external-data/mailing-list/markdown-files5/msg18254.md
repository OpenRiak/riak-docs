Hi all,

My impression of Riak has always been that it would recover from 
anything but yesterday we had the worst happened, there was a power 
outage so all the servers in a Riak cluster went down, once they were 
back we have been having these constant so my questions are:


 \\* How can I recover from this?
 \\* Isn't Riak supposed to restore corrupted hashes from other nodes?

This is not our production cluster but our development is now stuck 
because all the data we had there would take days to restore from 
another cluster, I hope there is a solvable problem.

Guido.
