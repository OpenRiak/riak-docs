Hi Everyone,

I'm curious if anyone has had experience using maps as containers for
a large amount of data.

Are there any inherent size limits for maps? Could you put sets
equivalent to several gigabytes of data into one map? I'd also be
curious as to the performance impact of deleting said map. Would it be
the same impact as scanning keys in a bucket and deleting
sequentially?

I'm exploring using a map to organize data within a time bucket if you
will to get around the leveldb back-end not having TTL support.

Thanks in advance!
