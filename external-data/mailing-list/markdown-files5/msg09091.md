&gt; Hello, I am attempting to create a 4 node riak installation on 4
&gt; separate CentOS servers. Installation of Riak went well. We have run
&gt; simple tests like riak ping, sudo curl \\-v
&gt; http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/test, ect, and everything seems fine with the
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Did you change your http address from 127.0.0.1 to 10.1.78.9? On that
machine, 10.1.78.9, does curl -v http://10.1.78.9:8098/riak/test work?


&gt; riak servers, they all start up with no errors. We used the default
&gt; ports in the app.config files. Ie: epmd listener: TCP:4369
&gt; handoff\\_port listener: TCP:8099
&gt; web\\_port: TCP:8098
&gt; pb\\_port: TCP:8087
&gt;
&gt; We have updated all ip addresses in the config files as instructed on the
&gt; riak site. Also, we have verified by telnet that the ports are all open
&gt; and that I can telnet between the riak servers. Still after all of
&gt; that, when I try to do a cluster command I get the following response:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; [root@essd-riak-test-server ~]# riak-admin cluster join riak@10.1.78.9
&gt; Attempting to restart script through sudo -H -u riak
&gt; Node riak@10.1.78.9 is not reachable!
&gt; [root@essd-riak-test-server ~]#
&gt;
&gt; I have been stuck on this issue for quite a while and tried everything I
&gt; found on the riak web site to resolve this. Any help you could offer
&gt; would greatly be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt; James Sweeney
