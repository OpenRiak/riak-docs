Sounds interesting. Does the ping covers a case when Riak is half alive? Does 
it check status of a backend engine? 
We had a case due to a bug that bitcask was down but Riak was up. 

Thank you,
Konstantin.

&gt; Konstantin,
&gt; 
&gt; Doing a HTTP Ping request[1] to Riak is one approach. You could also
&gt; do a HTTP Fetch[2] for a specific bucket/key pair.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing worth noting is that the all-new v2.0 of the Java client
&gt; we'll be releasing for Riak 2.0 is much, much better in terms of load
&gt; balancing and node management. It's built from the ground up to work
&gt; with a cluster vs. the old client which just sort of had it tacked on.
&gt; 
&gt; Operationally, for example, you'll be able to just push a properties
&gt; file out that your application can monitor and reconfigure the running
&gt; client.

&gt;&gt; Sorry jumping into the discussion. What is a best way to monitor Riak node
&gt;&gt; health? Most loadbalancer uses HTTP request to check if a node is alive.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Currently we use Riak Java client to load balance requests to Riak. The
&gt;&gt; issue is if a node gets removed or added all Java servers need to update
&gt;&gt; configuration to reflect the changes. It's kinda annoying for operation
&gt;&gt; team. So we started thinking about putting LB between Riak cluster and Java
&gt;&gt; clients.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thank you,
