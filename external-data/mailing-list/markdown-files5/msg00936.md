Hi there,

Quick newbie question: is there a restriction on what bytes can appear in
keys, or can they consist of arbitrary binary data? Using the Java
protocol-buffers client, I seem to be able to use arbitrary binary data in
both keys and values, but I'm having trouble retrieving this data via REST.
 As an example, suppose my key consists of the bytes (0x00, 0x00, 0x30,
0x39). How can I access this key via REST? The following doesn't seem to
work:

curl http://localhost:8098/riak/foo/%00%0009

Am I encoding the URL incorrectly?

Thanks!
Tony
