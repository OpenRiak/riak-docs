Hello riak users

I'm trying to get my head around the partitioning in Riak
Quite recent thread was very helpful

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.riak.user/6207/focus=6266

Let's say I install Riak on 3 nodes (initially), which will possibly
grow to 10 or more.
Default partition size is 64 and I store some data into bucket with n=2.
Does it mean that both copies of keys that are in 64th partition would
land on the same physical machine (node 1)?
&gt;From what I understood keys from 64th partition land in 1st partition
as well, which in that case would be on node1

If the answer is Yes, would it be better if I set the max ring size to
72 which divides nicely by 3?
Basho wiki states that ring size should be power of 2.
Is there any performance impact of setting it to such a non-standard value?

Or is there any better approach if I know that I will start with 3 machines?
Apart from changing n to 3 of course.

Thanks
D.
