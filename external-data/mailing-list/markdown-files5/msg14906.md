Yes - looks like its going that way too - a decoupling between the Solr Cloud
and the Riak Cluster seems like a solution that could work out and then
Yokozuna to index content out to the Solr Cloud (completely external to riak
- Solr not made to baby sit in Riak) - In this arrangement we could maintain
index distribution with Solr in a Sharded env (over implicit or composite id
collections) and riak used just as a kv. Yokozuna could also be used as a
front to Solr Cloud - and it will search on Solr and fetch the matching docs
from Riak and returned the merged doc back to the client.
