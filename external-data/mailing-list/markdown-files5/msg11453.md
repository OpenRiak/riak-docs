Thanks for the info!!! I appreciate the help and I am glad to know that it
should just work!

I don't really need the data from the whole cluster while developing the
script. I just need to get my queries working etc...

One issue I am facing is I don't know the structure of the data. So I am
trying to browse it (http://localhost:8098/riak?buckets=true) and I
getting content decode error.

Any ideas? thoughts on how to troubleshoot this? Or different approaches
to determining the structure?


Thanks AGAIN!!!


Mark

&gt; You've already received a little advice generally so I won't pile on that
&gt; part, but one thing stood out to me:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; My client has sent me a backup from one of their cluster nodes. bitcask
&gt; data,. rings and config.
&gt;
&gt; Unless I'm misunderstanding what you're doing, what you're working on will
&gt; not get you the data from the whole cluster, but the fraction of the data
&gt; that was stored on the one node that you have a backup from. Just a
&gt; warning, in case you hadn't realized this.
