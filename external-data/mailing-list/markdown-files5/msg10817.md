Hi Jeff,

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; In Riak, is it possible to retrieve all of the keys of an index? I do not 
&gt; want the object keys in this case, but rather the actual index keys.

I think this is covered by a feature I'm adding, if I understand what you're 
asking for. Does this example give you the values you want?

Say in current riak the query you might do would be

curl localhost:8098/buckets/your\\_bucket/index/catalog\\_bin/1000/2000

would get you a list of keys. In 1.4 there'll be the option to get the index 
values as well, so the results would be an array of pairs like {results: 
["1001" : "primary\\_key"]} where the first element is the value of catalog\\_bin 
index and the second the primary key of the object.

Is that what you're asking for?

Cheers

Russell

&gt; I am not sure that I am using the correct terminology, but to illustrate, 
&gt; consider a Riak bucket with the following objects, where "catalog" is indexed 
&gt; to "catalog\\_bin":
&gt; 
&gt; {'url':'http://www.google.com', 'catalog':'1001'}
&gt; {'url':'http://www.yahoo.com', 'catalog':'1001'}
&gt; {'url':'http://www.blah.com', 'catalog': 1002'}
&gt; {'url':'http://www.test123.com', 'catalog': 1002'}
&gt; {'url':'http://www.test12345.com', 'catalog': 1003'}
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to retrieve all of the keys for the index catalog\\_bin. From the 
&gt; above example, that would be:
&gt; 1001
&gt; 1002
&gt; 1003
&gt; 
&gt; To illustrate further, it would be the equivalent of the following in MySQL, 
&gt; if the above data were to be in a table called "urls":
&gt; 
&gt; SELECT catalog FROM urls GROUP BY catalog;
&gt; 
&gt; I would appreciate any advice as to how to query for this in Riak, or if this 
&gt; not feasible, then perhaps a suggestion for the best way to organize the data.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Jeff
