In the context of using distributed counters (introduced in 1.4), is it 
strictly necessary to perform a read prior to issue a write for a given key? A 
la, if I want to blindly increment a value by 1, regardless of what its current 
value is, is it sufficient to issue the write without previously having read 
the object?

I ask because looking at some of the implementations for counters in the open 
source community, it's common to perform a read before a write, which impacts 
performance ceilings on clusters with high volume reads / writes. I want to 
verify before issuing some PRs that this is in fact safe behavior.

Thank you!
