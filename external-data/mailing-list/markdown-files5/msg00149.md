&gt;
&gt; IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading an existing Riak cluster, please read
&gt; the transition document at
&gt; http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/src/45f284c5e5c0/TRANSITION

&gt; -----------------------
&gt; Riak 0.10 Release Notes
&gt; -----------------------
&gt;
&gt; IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading an earlier version of Riak, please read
&gt; the TRANSITION file in the directory above this
&gt; (http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/src/55a7f83c2ae2/TRANSITION)
&gt;
&gt; Riak 0.10 brings many new features and improvements.
&gt;
&gt; In addition to the existing HTTP interface, Riak 0.10 exposes a
&gt; protocol buffers interface. This interface allows for basic put/get
&gt; operations, and has client libraries in Python and Erlang. Support
&gt; for map/reduce operations, and additional language libraries will be
&gt; added soon. Read more about the interface on the wiki:
&gt; https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/PBC+API
&gt;
&gt; Riak 0.10 exposes the ability to tie into an object's update
&gt; lifecycle, via pre-commit and post-commit hooks. Hook functions can
&gt; be implemented in Erlang or Javascript. More detail on the wiki:
&gt; https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Pre-+and+Post-Commit+Hooks
&gt;
&gt; Listing the keys stored in a bucket is faster an more reliable in 0.10.
&gt;
&gt; The "eventer" subsystem has been removed from Riak. It was found to
&gt; be a bottleneck, as well as the main source of non-modularity in the
&gt; code. This should not affect client code, unless it was explicitly
&gt; calling 'riak\\_eventer:add\\_handler' function.
&gt;
&gt; Chunks of Riak have been rearranged for cleanliness and modularity.
&gt; If you are upgrading an existing cluster to 0.10, please carefully
&gt; read and follow the instructions in the TRANSITION file, referenced at
&gt; the top of these release notes. Some filenames and app.config
&gt; settings have changed, which you will want to account for in your
&gt; installation.
&gt;
&gt; Erlang applications that Riak depends on (webmachine, erlang\\_js, etc.)
&gt; have been moved out of the Riak repository, and into their own
&gt; repositories. If you install a prebuilt Riak, this change will not
&gt; affect you. If you build Riak from the source tarball, this change
&gt; will not affect you. If you build Riak by cloning from the Bitbucket
&gt; repository, your first "make" will download the additional source
&gt; needed from Bitbucket.
&gt;
&gt; Client libraries have been moved into their own repositories. Instead
&gt; of finding them under the client\\_lib subdirectory, please visit the
&gt; appropriate repo:
&gt; - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-javascript-client
&gt; - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-python-client
&gt; - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-ruby-client
&gt; (same as) http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/
&gt; - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-java-client
&gt; - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-php-client
&gt; - http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-erlang-client
&gt; (using protocol buffers instead of distributed Erlang)
&gt;
&gt; Riak 0.10 also includes a number of minor improvements and bug fixes:
&gt; - multipart/mixed responses from the HTTP interface now use proper
&gt; line termination (\\r\\n, instead of just \\n)
&gt; - fixed the "fold" functionality (used during handoff) for the
&gt; multi-backend.
&gt; - improvements to gossip corner cases
&gt; - improvements to shell scripts for cross-platform compatibility
&gt; - improvements for running map/reduce jobs on a degraded cluster
