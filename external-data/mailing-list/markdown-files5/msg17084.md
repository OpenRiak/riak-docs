Hi Colin,

Can you tell us what version of Riak you are running? In recent versions of 
Riak you can get this information by expiring the AAE trees for Yokozuna and 
then noting the objects that are flagged as not being indexable. See 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/aae/#AAE-and-Riak-Search 
 for 
some background info on AAE and Yokozuna, if needed.

Another possible option is to see if the the “\\_yz\\_err” field that is 
automatically created on certain error conditions might hold the information 
you need. See http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/search-schema/ 
 for info on 
“\\_yz\\_err”.
