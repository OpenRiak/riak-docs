I have a CorrugatedIron application that I want to make a MapReduce query
with. I initiate the query like

 

 RiakResult result =
riakClient.MapReduce(query);

 

Then I check that the query was successful:

 

 if (result.IsSuccess)

 

Now I iterate through all of the phase results:

 

 foreach (RiakMapReduceResultPhase phaseResult in
result.Value.PhaseResults)

 

I check that the phase result was successful:

 

 if (phaseResult.Success)

 

Most of the phase results are successful but occasionally this will return
'false' indicating that the phase result was not successful. My question to
this group is how do I handle this situation? How do I determine why it
failed? At this point unlike for a RiakResult there isn't an ErrorMessage or
ResultCode to give me some indication of what went wrong. What are some
good ideas as to how I might find out what went wrong? Thank you.
