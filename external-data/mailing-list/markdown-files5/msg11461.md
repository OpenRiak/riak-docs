Riak Users,

Yesterday we had to rebuild 1.4.0 packages and at the same time had to
refresh the Apt/Yum repositories with those new packages. Something in
this process must have broken down. We have had someone report a problem
with the Ubuntu precise repo filed here:
https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/349

We are aware of the issue now and will try to fix it as soon as possible.
 Sorry for the inconvenience.

-Jared
