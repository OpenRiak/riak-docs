Here's The Recap!

Keep your questions and answers coming. I hope to see some of you at OSCON
next week (let me know if you'll be there)!

## ICYMI Announcements
We had a product advisory regarding dvv and lww in the same bucket [0].
Please ensure you've reviewed the details

## Recently answered
Wendy had a great question about Solr integration (aka Riak Search) with
mult-valued fields [1]
Kota and Toby help a Riak S2 (aka Riak CS) change from leveldb to bitcask
backend [2]
Toby solved his own complication with proxy timeouts and shared the answer
[3] (thank you for that!)
Fred helped Gopi resolve an Erlang build that errors with a message about
crypto [4]
Shino gives Roman the command to run Riak KV in the foreground as a hidden
process [5]
Antonio gets a helping hand from MVM regarding leveldb deletion of files
[6], which leads to further questions. Antonio also shares that the task
completed and the command he used [7]
Luke has further questions for Gregg as they test their first 5 node
application and get errors [8]
MVM was kind enough to help Wes with an older thread on leveldb [9]

## What'd we miss?
Have you brought Riak into production at a new place? Did you find a blog
or presentation helpful? Good!

Share it in our release notes:

Share and enjoy,
