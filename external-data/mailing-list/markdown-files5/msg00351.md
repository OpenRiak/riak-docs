Hi,
 It has been while Basho announced about Riak Search (I guess it is
almost an year back, if I remember correctly), do you have any time frame of
release? Or will it be available only to the Enterprise DS customer? I am
one of the persons looking for Riak Search after moving from Couchdb to
Riak. Is it possible to release at least minimalistic API so that other can
build something on top of that rather than reinventing from scratch? I asked
this question privately to Basho team but did not get any useful response
so far. Currently Riak is suffering full bucket scan through mapred as
searching particular documents in a bucket is not possible otherwise
implementing another indexing mechnism on top of it. In my case
mapred\\_bucket is killing the performance (noting that same API is not
recommended by Basho). This is one of the frustrating stumbling block when
coming from Couchdb. Riak Search, as per presentation(
http://www.slideshare.net/jmuellerleile/riak-search-presentation-erlang-factory-2010-sf),
if available, is going to pull most of the customers looking for best in
class KV solution.

Thanks,
Senthil
