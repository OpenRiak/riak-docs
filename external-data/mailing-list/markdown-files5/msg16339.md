Hi !

I faced the same issue :)
Look at your cluster status with riak-admin member\\_status you will see
how much data your nodes should host.
Depending on your ring\\_size and how many nodes you have, you can get
more data assigned to one server.

If you follow basho's documentation, you have at least 10 partitions per
server. You might be able to transfer one partition or many to other
servers. If you don't, your partition size may be bigger than space
available on the other servers.
