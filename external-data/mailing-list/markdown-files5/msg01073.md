Riak Recap for 9/10 - 9/12

1) @TheColonial put together another great post in what is becoming an
awesome series. This one is called, "Webmachine, ErlyDTL and Riak –
Part 2."

Read it here ---&gt; http://bit.ly/cJ1fIv

2) Another reminder to those of you in and around Wyandotte County:
Basho hacker Sean Cribbs will be talking about Riak tomorrow night at
the The Kansas City Ruby Meetup Group.

Details here ---&gt; http://meetup.com/u/12fg

3) rb2k and bingledac had a brief conversation in #riak about
MapReduce, list\\_keys, code stability, and Riak as part of a thesis.

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/578147

4) drewr kicked off a conversation with seancribbs when he asked,
"What do people do to manage complexity in their mapred functions?"

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/578168

5) Q --- Is there an equivalent in the REST API to the Java
MapReduceBuilder's 'boolean keep' on the map and reduce calls? (from
joegallo via #riak)

 A --- '"keep":true' within the phase definition

6) outerim asked, "Is there any practical limit to the number of
prefixes one can use with riak?"

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/578181

7) Q --- Is the Python API thread safe? (from gaaradono via #riak)

 A --- We recommend using different RiakClient instances in
different threads. The client identifier is used as an entry in any
vector clocks created or updated by the client instance

8) Q --- Is there a guide to riak optimization? (from mheld via #riak)

 A --- There is not yet a formal guide to optimizing Riak. If
you're not finding the information you need in #riak or on
wiki.basho.com, send something to the list. (We also have a tendency
to turn mailing list questions/scenarios into wiki pages...)

9) @siculars will be giving a talk called "Adding Riak to your NoSQL
Bag of Tricks" at the NYC NoSQL group on Oct 5th. Mark your
calendars.

Details here ---&gt; http://www.meetup.com/nosql-nyc/calendar/14754065/

10) A Database Management Tool was open sourced this weekend by @8protons.

On githbub here ---&gt; http://github.com/WealthyThinker/Riaktive

No one over here at Basho has had the chance to test it out yet.
Anyone want to take a pass at it? There is a tshirt and some stickers
to whomever gets it up and running and emails the list with their
findings...
