You would need a range large enough to at least let all nodes connect to one 
another; I don't know exactly how the port allocation work for Erlang 
distribution but you could experiment with range sizes starting from the number 
of Erlang nodes, plus some extra to allow riak-admin and riak commands to also 
connect to the local node.
