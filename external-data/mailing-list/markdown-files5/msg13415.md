&gt; Longer answer: Riak gave users the option of client or \\_vnode\\_ ids in version

&gt; I am curious as to how that was accomplished when using vnode version

&gt; updates could detect they are concurrent and it could reject the update, but 
&gt; how could you encode the causal history using the version vectors so as to 
&gt; generate a sibling? That section ends with a statement saying no such 
&gt; version vector could be generated.

&gt; that described in the paper?

I guess you must be right. Riakâ€™s vnode version vectors, in the case described 
in 3.2 would generate siblings. The put of `v` with an empty VV would lead to 
the value `v` and VV {b, 1}, but the put of `w` with no VV would not lead to a 
VV of {b, 2} and overwriting of {b, 1}=`v`.

What Riak does is this: look at the incoming VV, and increment it (so {b, 
1}=`w` for that second client put) read the state on disk ({b, 1}=`v`) realise 
that these values are concurrent (the incoming value does not dominate the 
local value), so keep them both, and generate a VV that dominates ({b, 2}=`v`, 
`w`).

Does that answer your question?

Cheers
