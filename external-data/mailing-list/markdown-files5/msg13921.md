I'm gradually getting up to speed with the technical release of Riak 2.0, and 
am appreciating CRDT and the seamless integration into search.

I had just turned my attention to links, and started to wonder how I should 
implement links when the objects I will mostly be dealing with are CRDT 'map' 
objects, when I discovered that the link-walking functions appear to have been 
removed from the latest Ruby client!!

Is link-walking deprecated and intentionally removed from Riak version 2.0? Or 
is it just missing from the Ruby client?
