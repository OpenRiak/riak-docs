Hello All-

Adron here for this recap.

The team is currently stepping up to bat at QCon NYC, OS Bridge in
Portland, writing some new blog articles and collaborating on new practices
and thoughts on Riak and RAID. Along with events we've released some new
plugins for New Relic's new plugin platform, Tier 3, also integrated with
New Relic, is releasing an object store with Riak CS as the back end.

Thanks for being a part of the Riak Community and enjoy.
