I'm about to have two data centers bi-directionally replicating and I'm looking 
to confirm that Riak Multi Data Center fullsync Replication never deletes 
during replication. 

The MDC Architecture Page says that the two clusters stream missing 
objects/updates back and forth. 
It does not state that any deletions will be remembered and streamed. I'm 
assuming that fullsync never deletes?


And what about real-time? Those also only talk about adding missing objects and 
updates. 
Does real-time never replicate a deletion? 



Thanks
