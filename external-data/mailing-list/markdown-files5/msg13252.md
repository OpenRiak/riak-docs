Hi,

after an upgrade from 1.3.1 to 1.4.2 I changed the object format from
v0 to v1 and began a rolling restart. But restarting the first node
shows me some weird outputs:

'riak@10.46.109.201' waiting to handoff 132 partitions

this is the "restarted" node and the partitions is switching between
121 and 132 .. after some time it decreases to something between 110
and 120.. and after some more time it is now decreasing slowly.

My question is: why/how can it be that the restarted node has stuff to
handover? Shouldn't it be the other way around (there were no handovers
in the "riak-admin transfers" before the restart).

My guess would be something with AAE which has had something in the
queue which didn't show up in the normal operation? Or do I miss
something?

Cheers
Simon
