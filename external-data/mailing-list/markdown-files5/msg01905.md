Hi, Bryan.

You are correct with regard to standard behavior -- if there is a
layer between the client application and Riak, and you wish for the
actual links (as opposed to just the ability to traverse them) to be
visible to that client, then the intermediary must pass along the link
data as well.

There is a rarely-used alternative that might suit the scenario you
described if you find it too annoying to carry the metadata to your
client: you could set the "linkfun" bucket property to examine the
content of objects instead of metadata, and define your own custom
link serialization format to match your custom link storage format.
This would allow you to embed the links directly inside the objects
and still have mapreduce link queries work, but might break some other
things such as the HTTP interface to link walking. I don't generally
recommend this path, as you'd be well outside the realm of "normal"
usage, but it is possible.
