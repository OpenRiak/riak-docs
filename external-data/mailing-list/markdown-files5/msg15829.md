&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; We are running into a strange issue with Riak Search. Our setup is with
&gt; 3 nodes of Riak (with search enabled) in 3 different ec2 instances behind
&gt; ELB. App server talks to the cluster through ELB. We are querying for list
&gt; of objects through \\*:\\* query instead of list bucket keys and every time the
&gt; result is different. We have only 4 objects in that bucket / index, only
&gt; few times it's giving all 4 but ofther it returns 2 or 3.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This wasn't happening when we have one instance of Riak. Any insight?
&gt;
&gt; Hi Santi,
&gt;
&gt; Can you provide information regarding what versions of Riak you are
&gt; running?
