The overhead would be in parsing. But you could skip all that if you prepended 
constant length data to your text. Something like :

Field:Val field:Val text

Where field and Val length are constant.

Maybe like a guid:100

Where that guid is known to you to be the file size.

&gt; I was thinking about this too, but as I said, these text files are sometimes

&gt; put quite a lot of load onto riak and my application (deserialize a big chunk 
&gt; of JSON on every read). Of course, I might be wrong, I'll have to benchmark 
&gt; it probably, but I don't really feel very comfortable about it. Besides of 
&gt; potentially being a performance issue, it also feels quite ugly to me. Have 
&gt; you done this? How big files? How's the performance?

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am using riak to store (relatively large) text files. I store them as 
&gt; &gt; normal riak objects where the value is the text of the file. Now I want to 
&gt; &gt; index and search them. All is fine, I just enabled the "standard" search 
&gt; &gt; pre-commit hook for that bucket and they get indexed nicely. But, there is 
&gt; &gt; one tricky requirement. I need to be able to index and search some metadata 
&gt; &gt; about these files. For example date of submission, size of file, type 
&gt; &gt; (internal business logic) of file etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have been thinking quite a lot about this recently. Asked several times 
&gt; &gt; on #riak. I got one answer suggesting that I create a second "metadata" 
&gt; &gt; riak object for each file, link it to the "file object" and index it 
&gt; &gt; separately. That's not really what I want, because I need to be able to 
&gt; &gt; execute "combined" queries, like value: AND date:.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, here is the ideal solution that I'm thinking about.... It would be 
&gt; &gt; great if it's possible to modify the riak search index object. After the 
&gt; &gt; file is submitted, and after it's indexed, I could just fetch the index and 
&gt; &gt; just add some more fields to it.
&gt; &gt; I see there is a bucket with the search index objects that's automatically 
&gt; &gt; created by riak search. So I guess it is indeed possible, though I don't 
&gt; &gt; know what to expect. Is it a good idea? If not, what else could I do in 
&gt; &gt; order to solve the problem?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Metin
