Hello Riakers

I wonder if there is anyway to delete all tombstones that were left behind
when delete\\_mode was set to 'keep'

Also how do I estimate how much space the tombstones take ? We have a ton
of large scale and frequent delete operations and I suspect some space is
used by Tombstones. I would like to find out if it is significant enough to
warrant some cleanup. If it does, how do I remove them?

Thanks and wish you all Happy, Peaceful and Prosperous 2017 !
