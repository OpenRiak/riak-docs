Riak Users,

First off, sorry for the lack of updates on the RC front for a while, but
we've been busy testing Riak prepping for 1.3 release. Today we'd like to
make available RC4 for your viewing / testing / benchmarking pleasure. The
last public RC I sent out was RC2, so what happened to RC3? RC3 had some
performance tweaks we were testing internally so I didn't bother sending
that out if 99.9% of users would not have noticed any difference. Below
are the changes to RC4. If you are a eleveldb backend user, you should see
quite a large performance bump if you tried out 1.3.0 RC1 or RC2.


 - Several performance changes to eleveldb backend
 - riak/274: Riak fails to start on a single CPU
machine
 - bitcask/76: Make Bitcask I/O mode configurable: Erlang vs
NIF
 - bitcask/77: Change default Bitcask I/O mode to
Erlang
 - riak\\_control/53: style.css file missing from some
packages
 - riak\\_kv/482: Randomize the LevelDB write\\_buffer\\_size used for
AAE
 - riak\\_kv/483: Improve AAE backpressure on K/V vnode
write-path
 - riak\\_kv/486: Make AAE default to 'off' when not
configured

Thanks as always from the whole team!
