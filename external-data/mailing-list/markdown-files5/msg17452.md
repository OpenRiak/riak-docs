Hello All,

Just in time for the weekend we bring you a rundown of... the mailing list!

As always, we want to hear from you. Let me know if you’re working on or
speaking about something Riak related and would like a shoutout. I’ll get
your talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap.

## Community Code and Walkthroughs


 - Dan Cunnington shows us how to monitor Riak from NodeJS via an
 Appmetrics integration [0].



##Community Events


 -

 Basho will be at Spark Summit SF next week [1]. Stop by and say hi.



## Jobs at Basho

Interested in working on distributed computing related problems or helping
our community with theirs? Consider working at Basho.



 -

 Client Services Engineer (USA) [2].
 -

 Developer Advocate (London and US) [3].


Yes, we're remote friendly.


## Recently Answered


 -

 Guillaume was able to confirm that Solr is a resource hog and indeed
 needs resources to operate within tolerable limits [4].
 -

 Luke shares some Solr links with Alex to help grok relevancy queries [5].
 -

 Seema lets us know that Basho is no longer supporting FreeBSD [6].
 -

 Luke helps Alex get to the bottom of some Stanchion/RiakS2 (formerly
 Riak CS) related questions. Yes, Stanchion is an oracle and should only
 have one running process in your cluster [7].
 -

 Robert has a question about Erlang versions [8]. Sargun points out that
 kerl [9] is a great way to manage multiple Erlang versions on the same box
 and Luke notes that Riak packages come bundled with the correct Erlang
 version [10].
 -

 Vikram was having issues with data availability during different failure
 scenarios in a three node cluster [11]. DeadZen and I point out that this
 is most likely a quorum situation and how to ensure you always have access
 to your data going forward. Incidentally, always being able to access your
 data is exactly what Riak was designed to do.
 -

 Nick answers Richards question on the Riak Erlang clients
 thread-safeness [12]. Yes, connections may be shared in the
 riak-erlang-client [13].
 -

 Johnny and Alex are looking for information on changing a clusters ring
 size [14]. Although it is possible in 2.x, the feature is more or less
 deprecated. Changing the ring size is not without caveats and performance
 considerations [15].
 -

 Vikram is concerned with how Riak distributes data in a cluster [16] and
 Sam provides a number of great links that review the subject [17].
 -

 Norman is interested in using Riak as a session store backing in a
 NodeJS/Express application [18]. Riak is indeed quite adept at storing
 session data and Luke points out [19] a possible way forward by using the
 connect-memcached lib as a starting point by replacing its memchached
 client lib with the Riak nodejs client lib [20].



## Open Discussions


 -

 Kyle is looking for information on Riak TS drop table functionality and
 HTTP auth support [21].
 -

 Guillaume kicks off a conversation on custom Solr configs [22] and Luke
 points to an open issue on github reviewing some considerations [23].
 -

 Anil is looking for ways to copy Solr indecies from one machine to
 another [24].
 -

 Murali is looking for information around Riak S2 (formerly CS)
 performance on a single node [25].
 -

 Vladimir asks the list for help with the following warning “perflists do
 not satisfy the n\\_val” [26].
 -

 Alex is looking for advice regarding whether or not Riak TS would be
 better suited in certain use cases over Riak KV for his social network
 project [27].
 -

 Michael is looking for some guidance on properly sizing a Riak S2
 cluster [28].
 -

 Psterk is looking for help on using hadoops’s distcpy to copy files from
 Riak S2 to hadoop [29][30].



Do have yourselves a great weekend,
