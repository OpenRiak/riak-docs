Hello Ari,

1. I would recommend checking out the master branch of the Java and
Ruby clients. I know there has been considerable work done already to
get them working with 2.0. The Erlang protocol buffers client is
currently 2.0 feature-complete.

2. https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/tree/develop/docs - I hope you
will be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use Yokozuna.
Basically, you install a Java VM (I've tested it with OpenJDK 7 on
FreeBSD 9), and set "yokozuna = on" in your riak.conf file.

3. I don't believe "official" migration plans have been outlined yet.
Let me check on this.

&gt;
&gt; Since a client does not exist for 2.0, I was planning on using Jersey and
&gt; Jackson to make http calls to the db. Has anyone tried this and if yes, how
&gt; difficult was it? Are there any other clients that are worth looking at?
&gt; Where can I find information on setting up yokozuna?
&gt; If one were to migrate from 1.4 to 2.0 what would the migration path be?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
