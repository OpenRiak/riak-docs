+1 for data modelling examples and scenarios

On this note, I think a lot of people would appreciate data modeling examples and scenarios. One of 
the biggest barriers to adoption for many new data storage mechanisms is wrapping your brain around 
"How would I build XYZ with this?" The idea of "blog/store/forum/whatever with 
Riak" is a good start. Some problems naturally lend themselves to key/value data storage and 
some don't. Highlighting these with examples for real world practice would make it a lot easier to 
build up a body of practical operational knowledge.

More posts/ talks on actual use cases, agreed. The funny thing is that riak is 
actually one of the dead simplest nosql systems out there. There really isn't 
much you need to know to use it or set it up.

Believe it or not that may be a draw back cause there isn't that much to say 
about it in practice. Although Mathias did find a way to fill a book and I have 
bloviated my way through many a presentation on it. The depth is often revealed 
in a more academic setting.

Some tutorials like "how to write a blog, e-commerce shop, forum, social network, 
etc. using riak". People are actually afraid to use it for something they haven't 
seen it was used for be cause it seems quite compex in common.

The problem of any book is Riak rapid evolution.

Sometimes very cool and important features are added within a minor
release. That's generally okay, but I wouldn't read even a half-year
old book, it will contain very outdated information.

I'd add some cross-referencing between code (or features in general)
and the docs related to them (especially wiki pages of course).
Currently, wiki cannot keep up with the code, and probably releasing
docs updates along with pull requests could help that.

Upvote for a book like this.

I've spent a good deal of my time when evaluating Riak searching the Googles (and 
perusing the Basho git repo - thanks for that, by the way) for information like this. 
This list is a great resource (and so is the wiki, for that matter) but having a set of 
defined and sanctioned "best practices," as it were, in such an 
easily-avaialble and accessible form would be killer. I'm sure Packt (or maybe even 
O'Reilly!) would love to pick up something like this.

Heck, I'd even offer to help write it; my love affair for Riak is already at a 
ridiculous level as it is.

A good example of this is the MySQL Cluster project. I'm intimately familiar 
with its internals, as I've written many patches for the engine... but it's 
hard to explain to other people (especially management). Alex Davies published 
a book through Packt that explains everything and even gives advanced 
performance tips and scenarios. I keep this on my bookshelf in my office and 
hand it to anyone who comes to me asking about NDB stuff.

At this point Riak has been deployed thousands of times. This is excellent, but 
as you can imagine we here at Basho feel this is just the tip of the iceberg. 
We want everyone to be running Riak. The software obviously needs to solve 
enough problems for people to want to deploy it. However, we need to get the 
software into developers' hands before this happens. So the question is:

What can we be doing better?

I'm not talking so much about features in Riak itself. I'm more interested in 
the other resources, tools, docs, processes, etc., that you think we need to 
put in place or refine to take the Riak community from 1000s of users to 
100,000s of users. By virtue of being on this list, you've all spent some time 
using or investigating Riak. As such, you're opinions and experiences would be 
very valuable.

Any comments, ideas, or thoughts you had would be great. On or off-list will 
work.

Thanks for your time. Long live the vnode!
