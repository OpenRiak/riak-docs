How about using a 2i range query with pagination using max\\_results=1? Such 
results are ordered, so it's effectively an open ended query-for-first after N, 
if you choose a large end value for the range.

Hi Jon,

Thanks for your response. Unfortunately it is not as simple as that... in this 
particular case, I have a large dataset of predefined objects (with ranges 
already defined). I then need to perform the lookups given specific values.

Unfortunately the ranges are not uniform e.g. domain object 1 may be from 
1000-2000, and domain object 2 may be from 2001 to 2002 etc. The ranges do not 
overlap, but the fact that they aren't uniform makes this problem
slightly more difficult (i.e. I cannot clamp / round my value down since I 
don't have a fixed / uniform difference. In some cases the differences between 
startval and endval may be 0 or 1 or as high as 50 million).

How can you guarantee it's only a single object you'll find?

If you know an event happens every X minutes but don't know the exact 
start/stop times, you could truncate the startVal/endVal to the level of 
precision you need, hit that directly first and probe either side if you don't 
find it.

If I went with a design like that I'd make it so that I could store an array of 
readings under the key to tolerate timing issues, or to allow you to update 
your collection rate.

Jon

Hi,

I have a question regarding the most efficient way to perform a search / lookup 
for something. This isn't a typical range lookup (where you want to find all 
objects given a specific range). In this case I want to find
a specific object where a lookup value falls within that objects range.

My use case is as follows.... I have the following domain object:

MyObj
startVal (long / number)
endVal (long / number)
..... (other data)

I need to perform many lookups where I need to find a specific domain object 
given a long value that falls within startVal & endVal (inclusive).

What would be the most efficient way to do this in Riak? I can't think of a way 
I could do this via directly lookup, so that only leaves me with 2i and search 
as possible options.
They seem a bit like overkill, since in this case I am only interested in 
getting back a single object... but there doesn't see to be any other way to do 
this.

Would 2i or search be the most efficient / least impactful way to perform this 
type of search?

Thanks.
