I can't speak to the costing issues, as that isn't something I am
terribly familiar with, but at the moment, riak still has some
overhead issues with very small values. There are upcoming
optimizations in the next major (1.4) release that should help. What
issues did you run into?

&gt; was wondering if anybody has done a good thinking around where the cost
&gt; inflections points are?
&gt;
&gt; Also before I go and benchmark things how does Riak perform with 2B entries
&gt; which are &lt; 1K in size, when I last did the benchmarks - just before 1.0 -
&gt; there were a few issues.
