Actually, I think it's less efficient (more data sent over the wire) â€“ but
happens to be faster. The client is simply buffering key lengths from a
chunked response, which happens to be way faster than supplying keys=true.
I haven't looked at how this is implemented in Riak.

&gt; &gt; This is an extremely efficient way of counting the size of the bucket.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps I missed it. What does it do that makes it extremely
&gt; efficient? Are you perhaps just speaking in terms of lines of code? Or
&gt; does the riak-js library do fancy things in the .count() method?
