Hi,
some of our nodes upgraded to Riak 1.4.0, and are now refusing to start and 
join the cluster.
Is there documentation on the upgrade path from 1.3.2 to 1.4.0? It appears we 
have accidentally begun this journey, and I don't know if it's easier to go 
back or forwards now..

PS. It would have been pleasant to receive a warning about the new version on 
the mailing list!

Thanks,
Toby
