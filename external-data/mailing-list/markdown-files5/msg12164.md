Hi Daniel,It is a bit tricky to automate.While this isn't a solution for Puppet, I created a Chef cookbook [0] that creates a CS admin user, populates the proper configuration files, and restarts services. We make use of this cookbook in our Vagrant Riak CS cluster project [1] [2].Hopefully this is useful in trying to produce a solution for Puppet. -- Hector [0] https://github.com/hectcastro/chef-riak-cs-create-admin-user[1] http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Building-a-Virtual-Test-Environment/[2] https://github.com/basho/vagrant-riak-cs-clusterOn August 29, 2013 at 11:38:07 AM, Sajner, Daniel G (dsaj...@cas.org) wrote: 

Hi.
 
Iâm creating Puppet configs for a Riak/Riak-CS/Stanchion stack.  Ideally I want the stack to come up with some predefined users and buckets already created.  This is all predicated on having an admin user created in Riak-CS which is problematic
 in the Puppet automation realm given this value has to be generate via a POST to a running Riak-CS application and then set in the app.config file.
 
Is it possible to bootstrap Riak-CS with an admin user some other way than POSTâing to a running app?
 
Thanks,
Dan
