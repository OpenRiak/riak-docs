Thanks Jared. Will try it out and let you know how it works.

Am new to Riak. I plan to connect from Python and work with it. I noticed
there was a Python library to interact with Riak and plan to use it. I
assume it is pretty well supported.

However is there any requirement that Erlang (base or such) needs to be
installed? I guess the Riak installation will provide any necessary Erlang
needed. Or should I install Erlang from Ubuntu repo first?

Finally - with installing with dpkg -i - will updates and patches to Riak be
automatically updated as well when I do an apt-get upgrade? Or will be tuck
at the version I installed. Is there a way to install updates from Riak
command line or such?

Thank for your help.

Mono
