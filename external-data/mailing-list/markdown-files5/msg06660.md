I've been working on my own "simple" memory resident database on top
of riak core. I've been doing this as part of my work on building a
mud (multi-user dungeon) that will run in a distributed and clustered
environment. I hope that I'll be able to release the DB application in
the not too distant future in order to provide another simplish
example of using riak core. Once I do, I'll follow up on here and
hopefully it'll give you a little more insight into riak core.

Cheers,

Jeff

&gt; Hello Riakers,
&gt;
&gt; I am new to Riak/Riak Core. I would like to learn some small-sized
&gt; Riak Core examples to learn different aspects of Riak Core.
&gt;
&gt; I found three old examples in the bolg from the blog (Basho Banjo , 4
&gt; examples in "try try try", and riak\\_id), but I would like to try more.
&gt; Are there other recommendations?
&gt;
&gt; Lastly, when I wanted to try Basho Banjo &lt;
&gt; https://github.com/rustyio/BashoBanjo &gt;, I cannot find the folder
&gt; rel/basho\\_banjo. I noticed that the readme file is not updated after
&gt; moving to the new repository. Does some one know what's happing here?
&gt;
&gt; With Thanks
&gt; Jiansen
