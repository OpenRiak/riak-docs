Good afternoon.

I am considering several storage solutions for my project, and now I look
at Riak.
We work with the following pattern of data:
{
 time: unixtime
 from: int
 data: binary
 ...
}

The amount of data is about several millions items for now, but it's
growing. It is necessary to handle the folloring requests: for a list of
identifiers (about 500 items) return all records where id = from and time
greater than a certain value.

How to store such data and to effectively handle such requests with the
Riak?

Thanks.
