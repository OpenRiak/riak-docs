Thanks for the link Chris. I did see that project earlier but didn't notice
it was developed by a Basho engineer :-) will have a look in detail.

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt; I am working for a non-profit where members of the organization have a
&gt; need to store historical data for record purposes. These historical data
&gt; are video interviews, magazines (pdfs), audio recordings etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Watching Riak CS Build Your Own Cloud Storage by Pavan Venkatesh on
&gt; youtube it looks like Riak CS can handle our need. The question now is,
&gt; what is available opensource apps that use Riak cs as its backend and gives
&gt; nice ui like dropbox or at least close to it?
&gt;
&gt; We don’t officially support a graphical interface for RIak CS, however, it
&gt; appears that I wrote one back in 2012 in Rails.
&gt;
&gt; I’m not sure if the code even works, but it might provide a starting place
&gt; to build on.
