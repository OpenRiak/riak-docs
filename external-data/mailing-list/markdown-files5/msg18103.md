Today we are pleased to release Riak KV 2.2.2. Riak KV 2.2.2 is the latest 
bug-fix package for our current feature release, and continues Bashoâ€™s 
commitment to our customers and community to develop and deliver a highly 
resilient, high-performance, key-value database. In KV 2.2.1 we fixed 
 an issue 
 with nodetool, allowing it to work 
with SSL options in vm.args. However, in changing NODETOOL to an alias, four 
riak-admin commands (handoff, get, set, and describe) that used exec to allow 
them to run properly on all of our supported operating systems, now produce the 
following error message when they are run:
[root@node1 ~]# riak-admin handoff
/usr/sbin/riak-admin: line xxxx: exec: NODETOOL: not found
This bugfix release resolves the issues with exec and NODETOOL, allowing 
handoff, get, set, and describe to function properly. We have located the 
broken QA test that misidentified these commands as working and have corrected 
it for future releases. Information about the specific fixes in this release 
can be found in the release notes 
[1].

Downloading Riak KV 2.2.2

Open Source users can download packages from the Downloads page 
[2].
Riak KV Enterprise customers can download Riak KV from your Zendesk page (valid 
Basho Zendesk account is required). 
If you run Riak KV on AWS, you can also update to using the latest AMI.
As always, we would like to hear your feedback, suggestions or bug reports. 

Best regards,
Charlie Voiselle
