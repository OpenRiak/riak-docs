Hi,

I’m fairly new to Riak, and I haven’t seen a clear answer to this question 
through Google, so I’m going to ask the list here. 

Do I need to sanitize user input BEFORE sending to the Riak client, or does the 
client handle sanitization? (I plan to use the Ruby client, but I may want to 
use a different language client later on too depending on the project.)

I can see the potential for injection here being a real issue: 

{ 
“username”:”bob”,
“password\\_hash”:”abc123xyz\\””,”admin”:”true"
}

…or something like that. You get the idea. I’m just trying to get it right 
before I start building something that’s just begging to get owned.

Thanks.
