Hi,

In the security documentation here:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/security/

Instructions are given for how to limit the port ranges used for internode 
communications. E.g.

{ kernel, [
 {inet\\_dist\\_listen\\_min, 6000},
 {inet\\_dist\\_listen\\_max, 7999}
 ]},

Are there any recommendations on how many ports should be allowed. I'm assume 
this is related to the number of nodes in the cluster, and possible some 
details of the clients.

Can anyone provide guidance on this?

Thanks,

Simon.
