Hello, and welcome to the latest Riak Recap. RICON East is right around the
corner now. Smart people talking about big ideas, food and drink to
turbo-charge the thinking, and a great time for all to get the
conversations started about the next generation of Riak and distributed
systems. - http://ricon.io/east.html A new addition has been made to the
schedule yesterday. Sunny Gleason will be giving a talk called "Riak
Techniques for Advanced Web and Mobile Application Development." It will be
awesome. - http://lanyrd.com/2013/riconeast/scgmpm/


Following the start of the "Basho on the Road," section Iâ€™ve broken down
the recap into a few sections for meetups & hacking.
