Hello Riak Java Client Users!

We're currently in the process of writing a Cookbook for the Riak Java client. 
Its purpose is to make starting with Riak easier for new developers as well as 
provide coverage of advanced topics by providing concrete examples of using the 
Riak Java client. 

A few topics have already been posted, but there are a lot more to go. If you'd 
like to be involved, we'd love the input (and we won't be shy about lavishing 
gifts of T-shirts, stickers, and praise upon contributors!).

Please take a look @ https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/wiki/Cookbook 

Interested in contributing? See the TODO: page located @ 
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/wiki/TODO

Thanks!
Brian Roach
