Riak users in Minnesota rejoice: winter may linger for another 2-3 (or 4 or 5) 
months, but Basho is bringing pizza and beer to help you drown your sorrows.

Next Tuesday the 5th, 6pm at DevJam Studios[0], Basho will be holding the first 
Twin Cities Riak Meetup[1] to talk about the 1.3 release[2], RICON East[3], and 
anything else that sparks your fancy.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, and if you have any 
interest in giving a talk about your use of Riak at a meetup, please drop me a 
note. We're always looking for interesting use cases and war stories.

Thanks to DevJam for making their space available, and we hope to see you there.
