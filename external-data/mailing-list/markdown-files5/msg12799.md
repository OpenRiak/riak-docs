Hi,

I saw in the announcement of Riak 2.0 that Solr is now integrated into Riak:Â 
http://basho.com/introducing-riak-2-0/. The announcement mentions "highly 
available" and "built for scale". Those seem to be characteristics similar to 
SolrCloud. For someone looking for a distributed search server, is there any 
reason to choose Riak over SolrCloud? What are the pros and cons of the two 
solutions?

Also, is every Solr functionality available in Riak? Do the various Solr 
analyzers and stemmers for different languages work in Riak? What about the 
newly added Block Join feature 
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-3076)?

Thanks.
