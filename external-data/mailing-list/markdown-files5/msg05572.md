&gt; Hi,
&gt; This is more sort of a discussion than a question. I am just trying to see 
&gt; the trend in how users import their data to Riak. 
&gt; For the data I am using, I was able to achieve almost 150 records/second with 
&gt; PHP library, and 400 records/second with node.js (fairly new with node; was 
&gt; hitting memory wall when trying to import 1 million records).
&gt; What are some hacks/tricks/tweaks to import large amount of data to Riak?

New keys, new data, straight in for the first time, no fetch before store? I've 
had reasonable results creating a \\*number\\* of threads and using the Java Raw PB 
client to write. 

For example, maybe have a 1 or a couple of threads that reads data (from 
Oracle, a file, what-have-you) and puts it on a queue, and have a bunch of 
threads that pull data off the queue, create a riak object and store it. From 
my laptop I've got up to 2500 writes a second like this, and it was just ad 
hoc, throw away code with 4 threads against a small 3 node cluster (running on 
desktops.)

I imagine others on the list have more direct, real world examples?

Cheers

Russell
