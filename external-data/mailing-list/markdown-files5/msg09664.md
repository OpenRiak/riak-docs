Hi,
I am setting up a Riak cluster following the guide here
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/installation/Installing-on-Windows-Azure/

When my cluster was up and running I was updating the AvailabilitySets for
each VM in Azure which made the server's/node's internal ip to change and
the servers to reboot.

After reboot the /mnt/resource/riak is missing. What is it to be mounted
here? I initially thought this mount was just for installation but since
/var/lib/riak links to it's needed to be able to run Riak.

I have examined the shell script installing Riak and it seems to be the
rpm-package is mounting stuff at /mnt/resource/riak:

#!/bin/bash
mkdir /mnt/resource/riak
ln -s /mnt/resource/riak /var/lib/riak

yum -y install http://yum.basho.com/gpg/basho-release-6-1.noarch.rpm
yum -y install riak
....


Appreciate any help!

Regards,
Mattias
