Thanks, Chris. I was looking at them already but I didn't get list of
affected vnodes for some reason. Now you have confirmed that this is right
direction I will continue playing with it.

Thank you,
Konstantin.

&gt;&gt; I'm playing with riak\\_core to build a prototype. Thanks for giving such
&gt;&gt; powerful framework to build a distributed app :)
&gt;&gt; Looking at source code and examples I learn how to handle hinted
&gt;&gt; handoff(s). It works really nice. But I wondered how to handle a node crash
&gt;&gt; (when a node goes down unexpectedly for some reasons).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is there anyway I can be notified about node-down and get list of vnodes
&gt;&gt; that were primary on that failed node?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'd look into riak\\_core\\_node\\_watcher [1] and riak\\_core\\_node\\_watcher\\_events
&gt; [2]. They should help you build what you're looking for.

&gt; [2]
