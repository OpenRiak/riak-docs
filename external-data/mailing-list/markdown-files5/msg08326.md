Vladimir,

Alexander is correct. The integers are turned into binaries and 0 padded
(with a default width of 10). Note that the data itself is not padded,
only the index entry. The reason your queries aren't working is because
you didn't url encode. Also, you'll want to use single quotes around that
url to avoid the shell interpreting the &.
