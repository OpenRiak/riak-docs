Hi,

 Is there any particular issue with the Java Riak HttpClient when 
using a version other than 4.1.1? I have a pull request that doesn't 
pass the Travis CI build, even though I have verified it shouldn't have 
issues except for the that specific difference, if so, could it be tried 
with HttpClient 4.2.1?


 I have tried the integration test on our 4 nodes development cluster 
but never gets as far as in the Travis CI system, so I also wonder if 
that Riak cluster has some extra requirement to run the integration test 
phase from maven.


Best regards,

Guido.
