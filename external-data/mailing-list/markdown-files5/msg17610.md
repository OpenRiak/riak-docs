Hi Travis,

Excuse the late reply; your message had been stuck in the moderation queue.
Please consider subscribing to this list.

Without knowing more about how you perform bulk uploads, it's difficult to
recommend any changes. Are you using the HTTP REST API or one of the client
libraries, which use protocol buffers by default? What concerns do you have
about the upload performance? Please let us know a bit more about your
setup.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
