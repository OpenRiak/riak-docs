I (sequentially) made 146204 inserts of unique objects to a single 
bucket. Several secondary indices (most with unique values) were set for 
each object, one of which was "bucket" = BucketName (to use 2i for 
listing all keys).


6 of the objects appear to have been lost - they're consistently not 
found by GETs (by key) and are not found by 2i queries to the indices 
with unique values.


However, the "bucket" index search returns them \\_sometimes\\_.

Now, I understand there may be a replication lag, but this state has 
remained for over 3 days now.


"What is fucked, and why?" :)
