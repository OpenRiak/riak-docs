Hello Wendy,

This may be an issue with the Python client. Can you open this up as a bug at 
https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client 
, and our client team can take a 
look? I was not able to reproduce via http in an example (i.e. \\*interests\\_set\\*) 
I tried:

```
"docs" : [
 {
 "\\_yz\\_rt" : "maps",
 "name\\_register" : “3 Names",
 "interests\\_set" : [
 "thing"
 ],
 "\\_yz\\_id" : "1\\*maps\\*testbucket\\*3 Names\\*2",
 "\\_yz\\_rk" : “3 Names",
 "\\_yz\\_rb" : "testbucket"
 }
 ],...
```

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having an issue with stored multiValued fields in Riak search not being 
&gt; stored the way I would expect.
&gt; 
&gt; If I use the default schema, and store the following JSON document (from the 
&gt; documentation )
&gt; 
&gt; {"people\\_ss": ["Ryan", "Eric", "Brett"]}
&gt; 
&gt; and then search with the query "people\\_ss:Ryan", the document that I get back 
&gt; contains "people\\_ss": ["Ryan", "Eric", "Brett"], as I would expect.
&gt; 
&gt; However, if I instead create the document
&gt; 
&gt; {"people\\_ss": ["Ryan"]}
&gt; 
&gt; then searching with the query "people\\_ss:Ryan" results in a document with 
&gt; "people\\_ss": "Ryan", where the value associated with "people\\_ss" is a string, 
&gt; not a list of strings as I would expect.
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't find anything about this in any of the Github issue trackers or 
&gt; the mailing list. Is this a bug, or desired behaviour? Is there a way to 
&gt; ensure that lists with a single element are stored in Solr as lists, instead 
&gt; of as strings?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm using the official Riak Python client with Riak 2.1.1 and search enabled.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!
