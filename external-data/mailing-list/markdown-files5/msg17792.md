is using KV bucket operations in a Riak TS cluster the same as in a Riak KV
cluster
(in terms of performance) ?

I had a phone call with a solution architect from Basho who said it fits
only lightweight KV operations. This is written nowhere in the docs..

The reason I'm asking about that is the Spark connector, that works only
with Riak TS. The solution architect also said that KV queries from the
Spark connector are experimental, which is also written nowhere in the
docs..

I'd really like to get some more insights about this
