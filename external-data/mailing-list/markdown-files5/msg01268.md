Hey folks,

What is the proper way to upgrade a cluster from 0.12 to 0.13? Our 4 node
cluster was originally created by installing the 0.12 rpms. Is the process
as simple as stopping riak on a node, installing the new rpm and
re-starting? Is it possible to roll through each node one at a time while
the others are still available, or do all nodes need to be halted and
upgraded at the same time? I have backed up the /etc/riak directory to save
the initial config data. Are the 0.12 config files fully compatible with
0.13?

Thanks,
Scott
