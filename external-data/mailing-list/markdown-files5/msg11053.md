Hello,

i made a test with a 4 node cluster, where 1 node (node 4) is stopped after
half an hour. Half an hour later i restarted this node. I analyzed the logs
of all nodes after 2 hours. Node 1 and 2 had handoff data for node 4, node
3 not. The Bench Tool was running all the time and sending inserts to node
1,2 and 3.

My questions are: Are only some nodes responsible for hinted handoff, when
a specific node fails? Can i find some documentation about this behavior
somewhere?

Greetings Christian
