Hey Alain,

If you can successfully read the key(s)\\*, the simplest solution would be to
do a typical read/write cycle to overwrite the siblings with a single value
(merging the siblings would be dependent on your application).

If that is not feasible let us know and we can work through a way to delete
the object directly from the backend.

In either case, the backend will eventually, during merging/compaction,
reclaim the space for the version of the object with many siblings.

Cheers,
Jordan

\\* Riak, depending on your environment/network/etc, may not handle objects
that large very well. It may help to raise the "zdbbl" in your vm.args.

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; I had a bug in my ingestion code that caused sibling explosion in a
&gt; specific bucket. I have temporarily turned off allow\\_mult=true until that
&gt; bug is fixed. Is there a way to remove all of the siblings on those
&gt; existing massive objects (up to 10MB) now that allow\\_mult is false? Will
&gt; Riak do that automatically?
