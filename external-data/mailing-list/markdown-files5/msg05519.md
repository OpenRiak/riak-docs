&gt; We have been looking into ways to cluster keys to benefit from the LevelDB
&gt; backend's prefix compression. If we were doing a batch of lookups and the
&gt; keys from a given document could be grouped on a partition, they could be
&gt; read with less disk IO. However, consistent hashing in Riak currently
&gt; spreads keys randomly, based on SHA-1.
&gt;
&gt; What I think we could really use is a per-bucket configurable prefix
&gt; length for consistent hashing. We would then create keys of the form
&gt; "DocumentID:" and tell Riak to only hash DocumentID to get the
&gt; partition. This way, keys from the same document would be clustered on the
&gt; same partition.
&gt;
&gt; Is this on your roadmap already? It seems like it wouldn't require too
&gt; many changes to Riak.

If you look at the bucket properties by fetching them, you'll notice that
there is already an entry for specifying a key hashing function. Its not
documented, but you can read the Erlang code for the existing function
(pretty much just a call to SHA1), and create your own to do whatever
partitioning you want.
