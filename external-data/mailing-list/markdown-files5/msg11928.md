Hi. I've read somewhere around the Internet that Riak benefits its
performence when there are more buckets and not massive amount of keys in
them. Now, if this is true I'm asking for an advice on how to go about my
data model.

I've started off with one bucket called accounts\\_units. Every player has
his set of units in-game (like 10-20) and they all have their individual
keys in there. Since knowing what your units are is pretty important thing
I would be doing a lot of queries on that bucket. Then I thought I could
create individual buckets for every player and his units. Though it would
create A LOT of buckets with little keys. Would that be better? What do you
think?

Thanks for your time,
Max.
