Hi All,

I have a question concerning map-reduce. I have two buckets with 
counters enabled that have similar keys to track two different metrics. 
At the moment in order to combine these two datasets together I have to 
make 2 different map-reduce queries and combine the data within the 
client. I'm wondering if/how it might be possible to combine both of 
these queries into one. I'm thinking that Links are a possibility, but 
I'm not sure if it would or how viable a solution it would be.


Any and all advice is welcomed.

Thanks in advance,
Bryce
