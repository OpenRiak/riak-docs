I've issued the riak-admin leave command on one of my nodes but it does not 
seem to ever leave the cluster of 4 nodes. I've opened up all firewall ports to 
make sure the repartitioning isn't being blocked. riak-admin status on all 
nodes shows the node in question it is still connected and a ring\\_member. If I 
issue the riak-admin leave command again the error states the node is already 
in the process of leaving. I've made sure no clients are connecting to the node 
that left as well. I'm also still seeing bit cast Merge log messages in the 
console.log of the node that left. 

Has anyone experienced this issue and have some clues as to possible causes?

Thank you!
Dave Greenstein
