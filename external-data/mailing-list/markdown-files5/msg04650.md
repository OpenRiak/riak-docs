Hey all,

I just ran into a questionable situation. On the following doc page:
 http://wiki.basho.com/HTTP-Store-Object.html

It says:

"
Important headers:
Content-Type must be set for the stored object. Set what you expect to
receive back when next requesting it.
"

So I ran the following test via telnet against a 0.14.0 server. Note
the Content-Length is 5 given invisible characters: "def\\r\\n".

----
$ telnet 127.0.0.1 8098
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
POST /riak/test?returnbody=true HTTP/1.0
Content-Length: 5
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

def
HTTP/1.0 201 Created
X-Riak-Vclock: a85hYGBgzGDKBVIsbI0n/DOYEhnzWBmKDz84zpcFAA==
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.7.3 (participate in the frantic)
Location: /riak/test/F9uE8Heo6v0wtXY2rMKOktQbPGH
Link: ; rel="up"
Date: Sun, 11 Sep 2011 05:30:27 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 5

def
Connection closed by foreign host.

My question is why the response says application/json when I gave the
server application/octet-stream. Did I miss some RTFM documentation?

Thanks,
