We have been maintaining our our chef cookbook for riak because the
old basho one didn't fit our needs. As part of testing riak-cs I see
there appears to be a fork that is referenced in the fast-track (via
the Vagrant instructions)
https://github.com/hectcastro/riak-chef-cookbook.git Is this the one
people are using now? I'd like to look at using what the community is
using, just want to make sure I'm looking at the right one.
TIA,
bakins
