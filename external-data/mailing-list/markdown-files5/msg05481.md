I've made some progress. Looks like I was not compiling my module,
nor did I have the add\\_paths set in app.config.

However, now I'm getting a new failure:
 error:function\\_clause

When I look in my erlang.log file, I see this:
[{string,'tokens1',[&lt;&lt;"my actual data that I am trying to store before being 
processed by the precommit hook"&gt;&gt;," 
",[]]},{haleisen,mangle,1},{riak\\_kv\\_put\\_fsm,invoke\\_hook,4},{riak\\_kv\\_put\\_fsm,precommit,2},{gen\\_fsm,handle\\_msg,7},{proc\\_lib,init\\_p\\_do\\_apply,3}]


I've updated my mangle/1 function:
mangle(X) -&gt;
 crypto:start(),
 {\\_, Tokens} = lists:partition(fun(Arg) -&gt; lists:member(Arg, 
haleisen:stopwords()) end, string:tokens(riak\\_object:get\\_value(X), " ")),
 riak\\_object:update\\_value(X, list\\_to\\_binary(lists:flatten(lists:map(fun(Arg) 
-&gt; crypto:md5(Arg) end, Tokens)))),
 riak\\_object:apply\\_updates(X).

Am I manipulating the riak\\_object correctly?

Is there a recommended way to emit debug message from within Erlang hooks?

Thanks,
Hal

&gt; Sorry, typo in code. the mangle function is actually:
&gt; 
&gt; mangle(X) -&gt;
&gt; crypto:start(),
&gt; {\\_, Tokens} = lists:partition(fun(Arg) -&gt; lists:member(Arg, 
&gt; mangle:stopwords()) end, string:tokens(riak\\_object:get\\_value(X), " ")),
&gt; riak\\_object:update\\_value(X, lists:flatten(lists:map(fun(Arg) -&gt; 
&gt; crypto:md5(Arg) end, Tokens))),
&gt; riak\\_object:apply\\_updates(X).
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, I fixed the module reference.

&gt; &gt; Hello again. I have given up on using the JavaScript precommit hook
&gt; &gt; because I could not find anything which did not produce timeouts under
&gt; &gt; the load for my application.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, I have ported my hook to Erlang. Alas, I'm not getting very far.
&gt; &gt; I've installed my hook in /etc/riak/erl/hooks.erl. The code looks
&gt; &gt; like this:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; -module(haleisen).
&gt; &gt; -export([stopwords/0, mangle/1]).
&gt; &gt; stopwords() -&gt;
&gt; &gt; ["a","able","about","across","after","all","almost","also","am","among","an","and","any","are","as","at","be","because","been","but","by","can","cannot","could","dear","did","do","does","either","else","ever","every","for","from","get","got","had","has","have","he","her","hers","him","his","how","however","i","if","in","into","is","it","its","just","least","let","like","likely","may","me","might","most","must","my","neither","no","nor","not","of","off","often","on","only","or","other","our","own","rather","said","say","says","she","should","since","so","some","than","that","the","their","them","then","there","these","they","this","tis","to","too","twas","us","wants","was","we","were","what","when","where","which","while","who","whom","why","will","with","would","yet","you","your"].
&gt; &gt; mangle(X) -&gt;
&gt; &gt; crypto:start(),
&gt; &gt; {\\_, Tokens} = lists:partition(fun(Arg) -&gt; lists:member(Arg, 
&gt; &gt; ask:stopwords()) end, string:tokens(riak\\_object:get\\_value(X), " ")),
&gt; &gt; riak\\_object:update\\_value(X, lists:flatten(lists:map(fun(Arg) -&gt; 
&gt; &gt; crypto:md5(Arg) end, Tokens))),
&gt; &gt; riak\\_object:apply\\_updates(X).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I originally tested the code in the Erlang repl, using a plain string
&gt; &gt; instead of riak\\_object:get\\_value, and it worked perfectly.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I installed my hook into a test bucket:
&gt; &gt; bash$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/test-hook
&gt; &gt; {"props":{"allow\\_mult":false,"basic\\_quorum":false,"big\\_vclock":50,"chash\\_keyfun":{"mod":"riak\\_core\\_util","fun":"chash\\_std\\_keyfun"},"dw":"quorum","last\\_write\\_wins":false,"linkfun":{"mod":"riak\\_kv\\_wm\\_link\\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\\_linkfun"},"n\\_val":3,"name":"test-with","notfound\\_ok":true,"old\\_vclock":86400,"postcommit":[],"pr":0,"precommit":[{"mod":"haleisen","fun":"mangle"}],"pw":0,"r":"quorum","rw":"quorum","small\\_vclock":10,"w":"quorum","young\\_vclock":20}}
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When I try to insert a key into this bucket, I get:
&gt; &gt; Error:
&gt; &gt; {precommit\\_fail,{hook\\_crashed,{haleisen,mangle,error,undef}}}
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any help would be appreciated.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Hal
