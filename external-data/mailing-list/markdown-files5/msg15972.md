Is there any script available to put an entire nested directory of files
and folders into Riak cs as buckets and files?

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the link Chris. I did see that project earlier but didn't
&gt; notice it was developed by a Basho engineer :-) will have a look in detail.
&gt;
&gt; It was developed for a blog post and conference talk in 2012, so YMMV.
