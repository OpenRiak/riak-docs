It's worth noting then that comparing throughput of the disk via using `dd` to 
write a large file and then measuring throughput into Riak is an apples to 
oranges comparison. Based on Riak's design goals, I would not expect it to be 
able to translate potential disk-throughput to external HTTP-throughput. That 
being said, we're always striving to get closer to that goal :).
