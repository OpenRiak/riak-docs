Just to add to that.
Further test shows that 2i searches aso suffer form the problem of not
showing all results durring active vnode transfer.
Is this a known issue with Riak 1.2.1? Has it been solved in 1.3?

Anyone else experienced that? I guess attaching a node would trigger that
as well, maybe in less severe way.
Also I've read somewhere that you should attach one node at a time to Riak
cluster, and wait until vnode transfer completes.
I think it's no longer true in 1.2 since you have a plan that you commit,
but attaching a node and shuffling vnodes will cause problem described

What is the solution here? Waiting until vnode transfer finishes is not
acceptable (availability) and recent findings show it may take a while on
big clusters.

Daniel

&gt; What I was not expecting at all was that some of the keys won't be listed.
&gt; I'm not sure if that is stated in documentation to tell the truth.
&gt; To me it looks like it should be called 'listSomeKeys'
&gt;
&gt; About alternatives.
&gt; Some time ago I did comparison of listing and 2i and MapReduce and
&gt; surprisingly listing was quickest.
&gt; I'm not sure why it was happening. I did similar tests today and what I
&gt; got is:
&gt;
&gt; 1000 keys, grouped with 2i into 10 equal groups, each value &lt; 1kB
&gt; Listing:
&gt; - via listkeys 276ms
&gt; - via keyindex $key: 255ms
&gt; - via 2i (10 calls), total 2480ms
&gt;
&gt; So for that simple case 2i is 10 times slower.
&gt; Further test shows that 100k keys (100 groups, 1000 each) gives query
&gt; response between 250-5500ms.
&gt; Not good. It's almost silly NOT to use listing keys.
&gt;
&gt; I may need to do that test on different hardware to compare. At the moment
&gt; I'm using just one 7200rpm HDD for Riak db.
