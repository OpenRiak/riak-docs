HI Taufan,

riakc\\_pb\\_socket connections are usually long lived, and will stay open until 
disconnected or timed out while performing a specific task. There is no 
specific code in the riak\\_pb\\_server for ensuring that idle connections will be 
closed after a given period of inactivity.

If you’re opening and closing riakc\\_pb\\_socket connections at various places in 
your application — maybe consider using a connection pool for maintaining a 
known set of open connections that you use for issuing requests?

Thanks,
Chris
