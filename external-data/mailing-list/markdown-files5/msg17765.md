Mav -

Please remember to use "Reply All" so that the riak-users list can
learn from what you find out. Thanks.

Thebucket = riak\\_object:bucket(Object),

Can you check to see if "Thebucket" is really a two-tuple of
"{BucketType, Bucket}"? I believe that is what is returned.

&gt;
&gt; I have one other question though ...
&gt; How do I get the bucket type of the bucket of the key that was committed ?
&gt;
&gt; I am using these to get the key and bucket names. But I cant seem to find a
&gt; call to get the bucket's bucket type
&gt;
&gt; Thebucket = riak\\_object:bucket(Object),
&gt; Thekey = riak\\_object:key(Object),
&gt;
&gt; Thanks !

&gt;&gt; Can you go into more detail? The subject of your message is

&gt;&gt; &gt; Is there way RIAK can call an erlang function in a module when RIAK
&gt;&gt; &gt; starts
&gt;&gt; &gt; up ?
