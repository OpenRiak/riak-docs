Hey Jeff, (great name!)

Have you posted the specs for the low cost/power nodes you've built? If
not, would be interested in doing that? (parts, cost, anything interesting)

I noticed in your Future Steps section (
http://jeff.jke.net/2011/12/14/future-steps ) that you were looking to add
an administrative dashboard for things like node status. While I assume
you'd probably like something custom, have you looked at riak\\_control yet?
It's still being developed, but does a really good job presenting node and
ring status right now. It's quite pretty too. :)

You can find the riak\\_control repo here:
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_control It's part of the current master of
riak, so you probably already have it. I've been using it with the
distributed mud I'm building on top of riak\\_core (mostly to learn
riak\\_core), and have found it quite useful.

Going to read through your tutorial more carefully now.

Cheers!

Jeff

&gt; I spent the Christmas break setting up a Riak cluster and documenting all
&gt; the steps. I've got a howto/tutorial set up at
&gt; http://jeff.jke.net/2011/10/02/setting-nosql-cluster that will walk you
&gt; through the steps.
&gt;
&gt; In particular, I aimed for low cost and low power. Each node in the
&gt; cluster boots off the network (single point of maintenance for all node OS
&gt; configuration) and just requires a data drive. Nodes are assigned addresses
&gt; using DHCP and automatically update vm.args and execute reip if the node
&gt; address changes from boot to boot. The scripts for this might be handy for
&gt; anyone else running in an environment where machine addresses change
&gt; (Amazon, etc).
&gt;
&gt; I'd love feedback, and more to the point, I'd like to find someone to walk
&gt; through it step-by-step and make sure I didn't miss anything.
&gt;
&gt; Oh, and \\*thanks\\* to the list for helping me with configuration help over
&gt; the last couple weeks!
