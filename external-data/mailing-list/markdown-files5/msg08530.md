Hi

The plan was to use autoscaling for replacing a node that had failed for some 
reason, not for scaling it up and down based on load. If a node fails I would 
like it replaced as soon as possible and without manual intervention. 

But perhaps you are right in that I should do this manually until I am more 
familiar with Riak.

&gt; I'd be weary of 'autoscaling' a cluster. While it seems nice in theory, 
&gt; rebalancing
&gt; data when a node is added or removed from the cluster can be expensive.
&gt; I'd recommend having a human involved, at least until you have a bit more
&gt; experience administering a cluster.
&gt; 
&gt; To answer your question, yes, you'll have to write the code yourself to remove
&gt; the node.

&gt;&gt; Hi
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'm setting up a Riak cluster on some EC2 servers running Ubuntu. The goal 
&gt;&gt; is to use autoscaling to make sure that I always have the right number of 
&gt;&gt; nodes online. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; When I kill one node (shut down the server, it's gone permanently) and then 
&gt;&gt; start a new server to replace it (with a new name) the new server can't join 
&gt;&gt; the cluster because it can't communicate with the dead node. It works if I 
&gt;&gt; manually mark the dead node as down and remove it form the cluster but I 
&gt;&gt; would like that to happen automatically (perhaps after a timeout). 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Do I have to write my own code that detects this situation and removes the 
&gt;&gt; dead node from the cluster or is there a way to configure Riak to do this 
&gt;&gt; for me?
&gt;&gt;
