Nice.

Can you share your bb config? Is this against leveldb or bitcask? I'm
assuming leveldb, considering the limited RAM on these instances. If thats
the case, I suggest running your benchmarks for longer than 20 minutes
(i.e. several hours) if possible, just to get a feel for how well riak will
perform after a few rounds of compactions.

Lastly, do you plan on using these instances in production...or is this
just a sandbox environment?

&gt; Hey, something that is impressive about Riak is how well it performs
&gt; even on super low end cloud virtualization (unlike for example,
&gt; couchbase, which hardly runs at all unless you have quad cores per
&gt; each node)
&gt;
&gt; Having so much fun benchmarking, it's really distracting me from coding!
&gt;
&gt; the cluster : 5 nodes on Windows Azure cloud
&gt; Ubuntu 12.04, Riak 1.2.4
&gt; node are xsmall vm (1 shared cpu core, 768 mb ram)
&gt;
&gt; The xmall vms are only $15/month and they are not recommended for
&gt; "production". but in a 5 node riak cluster, it's really nothing to
&gt; scoff at!
&gt;
&gt; I suspect the main bottleneck is not the cpu or disk, rather I think
&gt; it's the each xsmall node is allowed only 5Mbit/sec on the ethernet.
&gt;
&gt; Here is a basho\\_bench graph, if anyone feels like viewing it
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; note the basho bench was running on a quad core machine on the same
&gt; vlan with 5 workers.
