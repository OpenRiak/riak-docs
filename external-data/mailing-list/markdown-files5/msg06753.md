I'm having trouble with riak-search. If I use the seach-cmd command line
tool to index text files, I can search the index using both search-cmd and
the sold interface. However, when I store JSON objects via the erlang
protocol buffers client, in a bucket which has the search pre-commit
trigger installed, searches in that index always return 0 matches for
search terms which have matches in the bucket. (I have saved these objects
to the bucket after the pre-commit trigger was installed.)

Is there a trick to this? It is my understanding that there is a default
schema for JSON objects, which should be sufficient as a starting point.
