Hello,

I'm preparing an evironment for an image/video storage website, with
riak-cs on top of riak cluster.
I have 5 servers with a 900gb disk each and about 700gb of images/videos
collected, mainly images.

I have a little over 300,000 objects in total, all stored in one place
occupying a little over 700gb data. Based on the formula: 700gb x 3
replication factor, I was expecting to use around 2.1-2.2 TB data.

After uploading half of the 700gb data (350gb x 3 = 1,05TB), I notice the
disk usage is around 70% already on all nodes (640gb x 5 = ~3.2TB). The
nodes are dedicated to riak/riak-cs.

Am I missing something?

Thank you,
Stefan.
