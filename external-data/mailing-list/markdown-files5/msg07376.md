You can use the $keys index to grab this information out of Riak. You could 
also write an MR job that returns just the key for every key that exists, but 
you would still have to read everything from disk... Or I think so, could be 
wrong.

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Still a relative newbie here.
&gt; 
&gt; I was hoping to be able to setup a MapReduce job that I could feed 1000 keys 
&gt; to, and have it tell me of the 1000, which keys exist in the bucket. I was 
&gt; hoping this could use the key index (such a thing exists right?) without 
&gt; having to read the objects.
&gt; 
&gt; The methods I've tried for doing this fail when the first non-existing key is 
&gt; found though.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a way to do this?
&gt; 
&gt; Or alternatively, is there a way to check for the presence of one key at a 
&gt; time without riak having to read the object?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Tim.
