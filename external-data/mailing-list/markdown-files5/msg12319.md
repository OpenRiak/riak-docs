That's about the rights of it. As I was reading your message I did some quick 
math and sure enough you already put that same number down. I've heard told 
that the max size for any Erlang network, of which Riak is most assuredly, is 
200 Erlang VM's. Extrapolating from there, considering that I've also heard 
told that a good sizing rule of thumb is 10 vnodes per node, you find yourself 
with ~2000 vnodes. Accounting for another wives' tale that the ring size should 
be powers of 2, 2048 looks to be the upper bound. 

Wives' tales, rumors and general misinformation aside, I've not tested those 
numbers in any way whatsoever but I would love to see an EC2 script give it a 
shot.
