Couple of questions.

I have migrated my system to use Riak on the back end. I have setup a 1.4 
cluster with 128 partitions on 7 nodes with LevelDB as the store. Each node 
looks like:

Azure Large instance (4CPU 7GB RAM)
data directory is on a RAID 0
max files is set to 128
async thread on the VM is 16
everything else is defaults

I'm using the 1.4.1 java client, connecting via the protocol buffer cluster.

With this setup, I'm seeing poor throughput on my service load. I ran a test 
for a bit and was seeing only a few gets/puts per second. And then when I 
stopped the client two of the nodes crashed.

I'm very new with Riak, so I figure I'm doing something wrong. I saw a note on 
the list earlier of someone getting well over 1000 puts per second, so I know 
it can move pretty fast. 

What is a good strategy for troubleshooting?

How many fetch/update/store loops per second should I expect to see on a 
cluster of this size?

Thanks!

Paul
