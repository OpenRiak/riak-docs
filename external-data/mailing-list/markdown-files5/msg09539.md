Good catch! Thank you. If I have three machines that take up ports
8098,8099, and 8100 what do you suggest the handoff port should be? When is
it used?

OK, perhaps you're using the same port for different functions in Riak?

In particular, I see you're using 8099 for your http port but in my setup
8099 is used for "handoff\\_port".

Here's the ports I'm using:

pb\\_port, 8087
http, 8098
handoff\\_port, 8099

Make sure all three (four if you're also using "https") are on different
ports.

Shane.
