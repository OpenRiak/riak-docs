Hi All

I have 5 node cluster of riak database. I have take backup of this database
& trying to restore it with riak-admin. But it take too much much already
7days has passed & still restoration process is running. I want to know is
their any command or way to restore it quickly.

I am trying to restore it in single node server in my local for Backup
testing. For same I have started a aws ec2 intance of large capacity of
m3.x2large but the result is same.

Thanks
Gaurav
