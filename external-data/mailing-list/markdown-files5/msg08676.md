Deepak,

 I think that was fixed on the following pull request but, you would 
have to compile your own client from github which is easy; or, did you 
get the new 1.0.6? I'm not sure if it is already available at maven 
repos, anyways, there is a lot going on in the riak client in java, I 
would suggest you to keep an eye on the github, many good bugs getting 
fixed quickly.

Best regards,

Guido

Hi,

My servers complain about a leaky apache DateUtils class during hot 
deployments. This is a known bug 
 in http 4.1.x 
and has been fixed in 4.2.x. Can the next version of riak-client be 
updated to include the newer HTTP client (the current version is 4.1.1 
) ? Is the riak-client compatible with httpclient 4.2.x as it is ?


Thanks
Deepak Bala
