Hi,

&gt; Have you tried executing your javascript outside of Riak?

The problem with this approach is I need to make some assumptions on
what the data as inout to my function looks like.

&gt; Also, consider wrapping the code in your function with an eval so you can
&gt; catch errors that occur. (Then either ejslog them or return them as results
&gt; of the map phase)

With ejsLog() also not working for me I am finding it hard to inspect
what riak is passing into my function to debug it elsewhere (like a js
repl).
