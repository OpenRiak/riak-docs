Hey All!

If you happen to be in and/or around NYC Thursday, April 14th @ 7pm
come on out and talk some Riak while enjoying a frothy brew or two.
Francisco Treacy, of http://riakjs.org fame, and I will be talking
Riak, Nodejs, nosql and all things distributed and possibly persisted
at Stout[0], 133 W 33rd between 6th and 7th ave. Bring your enthusiasm
and leave your relational ball and chain at the office.

Francisco wrote the nodejs riak driver, riak-js, in coffee-script[1]
so there will be lots of js talk to be had as well.

Cheers,

-Alexander Sicular
