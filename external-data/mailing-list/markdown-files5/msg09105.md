I reindexed a bunch of items that are still in the search index but no
disk space was reclaimed. Is there any Riak console Erlang voodoo I
can do to convince Riak Search that now would be a good time to
compact the merge\\_index?

&gt; The current data set I have in Riak is static, so no new items are
&gt; being written. So this looks like the reason as to why compaction
&gt; isn't happening since there is no time based trigger on the merge
&gt; index. To get compaction to kick in, I should be able to to just
&gt; reindex (by reading and rewriting) some of the existing items in
&gt; buckets that are still indexed? Earlier today I upgraded to Riak 1.2
&gt; and ran a Search read repair [3] in an attempt to kick of compaction.
&gt; Compaction didn't kick in, but instead disk consumption increased
&gt; again. Should Search Repair trigger compaction or only writing objects
&gt; to the KV store?
