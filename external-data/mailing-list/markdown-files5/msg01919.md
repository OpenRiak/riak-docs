Hi,

 I recently forked riak-erlang-client to use the mainline erlang\\_protobuffs
(or at least a fork of it). In case any users out there are interested
here they are.

https://github.com/djnym/riak-erlang-client
https://github.com/djnym/erlang\\_protobuffs

So far they work great for me, and allow me to get the newly available features
of erlang\\_protobuffs.

I was also noticing some inconsistencies in the documentation of the client
which I fixed up (mostly that the put option is return\\_body, not returnbody),
but also made a few other parts more consistent.

However, I did notice one annoyance with the API which I was curious about.
For almost every example the bucket is passed as a binary, except for those
in the Bucket Properties section, where the bucket is passed as a string.
Is there a reason to not just make the riakc\\_pb\\_socket:get\\_bucket/2 and
riakc\\_pb\\_socket:set\\_bucket/3 calls take a binary like all the other calls?

Just wondering,

-Anthony
