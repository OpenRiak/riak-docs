I'd like to get started with Riak 2.0, and would appreciate
insight/feedback on the following:

 1. Since a client does not exist for 2.0, I was planning on using Jersey
 and Jackson to make http calls to the db. Has anyone tried this and if yes,
 how difficult was it? Are there any other clients that are worth looking at?
 2. Where can I find information on setting up yokozuna?
 3. If one were to migrate from 1.4 to 2.0 what would the migration path
 be?

Thanks.
