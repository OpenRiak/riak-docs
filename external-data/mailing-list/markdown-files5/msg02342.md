I'm not familiar with those - will do some reading.

Thanks

&gt;&gt; I was thinking of using memcached for cheap, fast storage to share

&gt;&gt; define which servers you want to use for storage. Ideally I don't
&gt;&gt; care. I want my core/auth server to write preferences and permissions
&gt;&gt; to the cache and let tornado on other servers pull those keys out. I
&gt;&gt; think Riak could perform this in theory, but is Riak fast enough?
