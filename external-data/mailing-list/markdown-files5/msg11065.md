Hi all,

I have my riak node crashed and can't figure out why this has happened. Any
help would be appreciated.

I'm using riak 1.3.1 and running a single node on CentOS 6.3 (availability
is not critical right now).
This node uses Bitcask backend with the default configuration except for
expiry\\_secs property which is set to 15552000.
The properties of a single bucket used are the following:
{"props":{"allow\\_mult":false," basic\\_quorum":false,"big\\_
vclock":50,"chash\\_keyfun":{"mod":"riak\\_core\\_util","fun":"chash\\_std\\_keyfun"},"dw":"quorum","last\\_write\\_wins":false,"linkfun":{"mod":"riak\\_kv\\_wm\\_link\\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\\_linkfun"},"n\\_val":2,"name":"c","notfound\\_ok":true,"old\\_vclock":86400,"postcommit":[],"pr":0,"precommit":[],"pw":0,"r":"one","rw":"quorum","small\\_vclock":50,"w":"one","young\\_vclock":20}}
There is enough disk space and RAM on the server.
At the moment of the crash size of the most partitions was about 1.1Gb, but
few of them were smaller.
Attaching error.log and crash.log

Thanks in advance.

Alexander
