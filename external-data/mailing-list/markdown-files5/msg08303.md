Riak Recap for August 4 - 15
=====================

1) We added a whole mess of RICON talks to the schedule (and we still
have a few more to announce). This is a reminder that you should
attend RICON and ping me for a discount code.

\\* Talk descriptions here ---&gt; http://lanyrd.com/2012/ricon2012/
\\* Conference site here ---&gt; ricon2012.com
\\* Buy tickets for you and your friends here ---&gt; ricon2012.eventbrite.com

2) We posted the video of the Riak at Braintree talk that happened
last month at the Chicago meetup. This one is well worth your 30
minutes.

\\* Watch here ---&gt; http://basho.com/blog/technical/2012/08/14/riak-at-braintree/

3) The Riak Homebrew Recipe was updated for 1.2.

\\* Details here ---&gt;

4) Basho hacker Ryan Zezeski has some experimental with Riak and Solr.
(It's worth noting that this code is inspired by work that John
Muellerleile started some months ago. )

\\* Code here ---&gt; https://github.com/rzezeski/yokozuna

5) The H-Online wrote a piece about 1.2's official FreeBSD support.

6) Briam McClain is working on a BOSH release for Riak. (This should
be interesting to any of you Cloud Foundry fans out there.)

\\* Code here ---&gt; https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/riak-release

7) We announced the first Riak Boston Meetup. The team at Shareaholic
will be sharing details on their live Mongo to Riak migration. It's
happening on August 30th at the Basho offices.

\\* Details here --&gt; http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Riak/events/77828202/

8) Basho released some Nagio scripts for Riak.

\\* Code here ---&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\\_nagios

9) Dan Ostrowski has some new Python code up on Bitbucket for modeling
Riak documents.

\\* Code here ---&gt; https://bitbucket.org/danostrowski/riakdocs

10) Justin Sheehy was interviewed about, among other things, Riak and
eventual consistency, by odbms.org.

11) TransactCharlie posted a video of a lightning talk called "The CAP
Theorem, Riak and Beyonce". (I \\*think\\* TransactCharlie is also the
speaker.)

12) A video of Kresten Krab Thorup's "Bringing Riak to the Mobile
Platform" talk from QCon London is now online and viewable.
