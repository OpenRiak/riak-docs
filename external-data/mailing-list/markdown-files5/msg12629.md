I think the below setting is what we want to use for our environment
&gt; r = 1
&gt; notfound\\_ok=false
&gt; basic\\_quorum = true
&gt;
&gt; the client gets notfound if the first two replies are notfound? if the
&gt; first
&gt; reply is found, the client gets found? if the first reply is notfound, the
&gt; second is found, does the client get found, or have to wait for the third
&gt; vnode (in my environment, N=3) to reply?
Â« [hide part of quote]

notfound will be returned only if both servers return notfound, and the
request will not wait for a 3rd server in any sequence of events. 

Just to confirm -- if the first reply is found, the client gets found? if
the first reply is notfound, the
second is found, the client also gets found?

BTW, what is the proper channel to get the documentation page
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/references/http/fetch-object/ updated
in regards to R and PR, with what you suggested above?
