Oleksiy,

Indexes have some overhead of their own, but they also have a reasonable limit 
on doc count (hundreds of millions per node). To answer you question requires a 
bit more knowledge of your use-case. One index can be more efficient, as long 
as you're not creating hundreds of thousands of buckets. On the other hand, you 
don't want to create hundreds of thousands of indexes. Could you us give a bit 
more information of your expected numbers?

Thanks,
Eric

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone please suggest what will be the best setup of Yokozuna (I mean 
&gt; indexing/search performance) if I have many buckets of the same bucket-type:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. having 1 yokozuna index associated with a bucket-type (e.g. with all 
&gt; buckets)
&gt; 2. having separate yokozuna index created and associated with each bucket
&gt; 
&gt; In my setup I will always have to search within a single (specified) bucket 
&gt; only so that search results from other buckets do not mix together.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
