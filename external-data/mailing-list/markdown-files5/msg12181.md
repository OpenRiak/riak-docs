Hello,

I am just starting with Riak, please forgive my ignorance.

I have read the tutorial that demonstrates how to store Ruby (I am using
Ruby for now) hashes in Riak. The client will serialise my hash into JSON
and post it to Riak. I already have JSON, and I do not want to parse it to
submit it to the client which will serialise it back to JSON. I would like
to post my JSON verbatim to Riak directly (I do want Riak to parse it on
its side and generate a set of key/value pair from it). I understand that
Riak has HTTP interface, so I would have to issue a request manually to
achieve this? How is it done?

Thanks
Konstantin
