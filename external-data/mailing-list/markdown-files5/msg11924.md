Thanks Jared. I wonder why my searching didn't locate these issues on 
GitHub? My Google-fu must be lacking. :-)


It doesn't seem to be causing us any problems and @beerriot's comments 
on #49 seem to indicate the messages are safe to ignore so that's what 
I'll do until we're ready to upgrade.


Thanks again!

Shane,

This bug was fixed in Riak 1.4.x in this commit
https://github.com/basho/riak\\_pipe/pull/73 which was backported to 1.3.2
with this https://github.com/basho/riak\\_pipe/pull/74. I'm not an expert on
the issue itself, so I'll have to ask if those messages are something that
are safe to ignore.

G'day!

Nearly every day since upgrading to Riak 1.3.1 I've been seeing the
following errors on random nodes:

2013-08-05 01:00:05.775 [error] &lt;0.212.0&gt; Supervisor riak\\_pipe\\_fitting\\_sup
had child undefined started with riak\\_pipe\\_fitting:start\\_link() at &lt;
0.26698.882&gt; exit with reason noproc in context shutdown\\_error

2013-08-05 14:14:35.431 [error] &lt;0.709.0&gt; Supervisor riak\\_kv\\_mrc\\_sink\\_sup
had child undefined started with riak\\_kv\\_mrc\\_sink:start\\_link() at &lt;
0.18229.970&gt; exit with reason noproc in context shutdown\\_error

What do they mean? I suspect I can ignore them as they're very similar to
the "{sink\\_died,normal}" messages that we would occasionally get with
previous versions. However, if they're not indicative of a problem why are
they reported as an [error]?

Can someone shed some light on these errors?

Thanks!

Shane.
