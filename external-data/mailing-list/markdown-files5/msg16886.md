Hi Jason,

Actually I was moving nodes, one by one. I guess I was missing
the riak-admin replace command. Is there an easy way of restoring Solr
indexes on disk on a node? The data is fine after the recovery but the
index data got deleted in the yz folder. Any advice how to restore it when
a cluster is running and the data is there?

If the fastest way to recover is the reload the entire dataset that is fine
too.

Thank you in advance,
Istvan

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I had to move the nodes of a Riak cluster to new ones. Everything is fine
&gt; with the data, we have been following the recovery procedures here:
&gt;
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/backups/#Restoring-a-Node
&gt;
&gt; After the moving all of the nodes I found out that all of the Solr indexes
&gt; are gone.

&gt; Hi Istvan,
&gt;
&gt; It looks like you are restoring an entire cluster, not just a single node
&gt; within a cluster. If so, the relevant recovery procedures are documented on
&gt; this page:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/recovery/failure-recovery/#Cluster-Recovery-From-Backups
&gt;
&gt; Can you try following the full cluster recovery procedure and see if that
&gt; solves the problem?
