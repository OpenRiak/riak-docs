If you've seen RICON presentations in person or on the web, you likely 
appreciate the quality and depth of the talks, but that's only possible because 
we receive great proposals.

As you probably are aware, we're holding our next RICON in San Francisco at the 
end of October.

If you have interesting Riak experiences to share (or other distributed systems 
theory/learnings), please contact us. Your active involvement can only improve 
RICON.
