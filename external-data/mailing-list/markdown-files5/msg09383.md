Hi list,

I have a bunch of random questions about the Erlang API that aren't
quite answered by the documentation (at least from what I could find):

\\* Is the proper way to replace the object associated with a bucket/key
pair to simply do a riakc\\_pb\\_socket:put/2 with the same bucket/key
pair (with a new object)?
\\* What exactly is the purpose of riakc\\_obj:update\\_value/2 (with
regards to the above question)?
\\* How does one associate a secondary index with an object? Is this
done via riakc\\_obj:update\\_metadata/2?
\\* Is there any particular reason the Erlang client doesn't yet support
all bucket properties?
\\* What exactly do the various get and put options do? Specifically,
if\\_modified, notfound\\_ok, basic\\_quorum, head, and deletedvclock for
the former and return\\_body, return\\_head, if\\_not\\_modified, and
if\\_none\\_match for the former.
\\* How will riakc\\_pb\\_socket:get/3 behave when queue\\_if\\_disconnected is
enabled? Will it fail immediately if the socket is disconnected or
block until it has reconnected?

Thanks in advance!

Regards,
Alex
