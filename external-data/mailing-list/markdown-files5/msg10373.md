Thanks Jeremy

In our code I'm discarding ghost keys although I'm quite sure default
settings in Java client should not return tombstones.
I think my bug in the code contributed to the problems I've observed. I'm
using DomainBucket and custom converter and in that case I think I need to
explicitly set
VClock on the POJO object. I need to investigate that.
Thanks for the tips with map-reduce. For the tim being I think I'll stick
to merging existing/deleted values hopefully in a reliable way. I just need
to make sure I won't resurrect deleted keys.

Daniel
