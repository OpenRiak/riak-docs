ok I loled at this. then got worries trump could win a node election.

anyways. 24gigs per riak server is not a bad safe bet.
Erlang in general is ram heavy. It uses it more effectively then most
languages wrt concurrency, but ram is the fuel for concurrency and buffer
for operations, especially dumb operations involving large orange
loud-mouth objects.. as pointed out you can increase cumulative resources
by adding more physical nodes. and there is a trade off for adding more
virtual nodes. theres also an IPC trade off adding more then a few dozen
physical nodes in the same cluster. Theres also possiby a trade off using
riak ts and riak kv in the same cluster. Nothing but tradeoffs.

&gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt;
&gt; Ya, I'm not surprised you're having issues. 4GB ram is woefully
&gt; underspecd. üòî
&gt;
&gt; ü§ìStupid math:
&gt;
&gt; 3e7 x 3 (replication) / 9 = 1e7 minimum objects per node ( absolutely more
&gt; due to obj &gt; 1MB size )
&gt;
&gt; 1e7 x ~400 bytes per obj in ram = 4e9 ram per node just for bitcask. Aka 4
&gt; GB.
&gt;
&gt; You already hit your limit. We can stop here. Done. End of. ‚ò†Ô∏è
&gt;
&gt; ü§îBut let's continue for funziesüòã.
&gt;
&gt; Assuming defaults:
&gt;
&gt; Default ring\\_size = 64 / 9 nodes ~ 7 virtual nodes per physical node.
&gt;
&gt; Default leveldb ram allocation = 70%
&gt;
&gt; Leveldb operates, aka consumes resources including ram, on a vnode basis.
&gt; It likes to consume ram on the order of 300MB through 2.5GB per vnode,
&gt; increasing in performance till it caps. Even if you did switch everything
&gt; to level you'd still be redlined.
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line is that bitcask, leveldb and your OS are fighting for ram all
&gt; day 'ery dayüò°. Why you hate them and make them fight like that?üò© Not
&gt; nice! (Trumpisms!)ü§ì
&gt;
&gt; -Alexander
&gt;
&gt; ps. You probably want to bump to 128 ring size. More vnodes equals more
&gt; parallelism, but also means more resource consumption. You prob want min 8
&gt; (v)CPU and 16GB min ram. YMMV, check my math.
&gt;
&gt; pps. If you don't want to double your per VM cost (aws ec2, etc) you could
&gt; add nodes to the cluster. Because Riak uniformly distributes data around
&gt; the cluster adding nodes increase total resources to the cluster, reduces
&gt; number of objects allocated to each node. The converse is also true, if you
&gt; double your node size you could halve your node count. That said, systems
&gt; like Riak like prefer more nodes. It's just a math game.

&gt; Hi Alexander,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for responding.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; How many nodes?
&gt;
&gt; We currently have 9 nodes in our cluster.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; How much ram per node?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Each node has 4GB of ram and 4GB of swap. The memory levels (ram + swap)
&gt; on each node are currently between 4GB and 5.5GB.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; How many objects (files)? What is the average file size?
&gt;
&gt; We currently have &gt;30 million objects, and I analyzed the average object
&gt; size before we migrated data into the cluster it was about 4KB/object, with
&gt; some objects being much larger (multiple MB). Is there an easy way to get
&gt; this information from a running cluster so I can give you more accurate
&gt; information?

&gt; -You should be using 5 minimum if you using the default config. There
&gt; are reasons.
&gt;
&gt; How much ram per node?
&gt; -As you noted, in Riak CS, 1MB file chunks are stored in bitcask.
&gt; Their key names and some overhead consume memory.
&gt;
&gt; How many objects (files)? What is the average file size?
&gt; -If your size distribution significantly skews &lt; 1MB that means you
&gt; will have a bunch of files in bitcask eating up ram.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have a Riak CS cluster up and running, and am anticipating exponential
&gt; &gt;&gt; growth in the number of key/value pairs over the next few years. From
&gt; &gt;&gt; reading the documentation and experience, I've concluded that the
&gt; default
&gt; &gt;&gt; configuration of CS (with riak\\_cs\\_kv\\_multi\\_backend) keeps all keys in
&gt; RAM.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The OOM killer strikes when Riak uses too much RAM, which is not good
&gt; for my
&gt; &gt;&gt; sanity or sleep. Because of the amount of growth I am anticipating, it
&gt; seems
&gt; &gt;&gt; unlikely that I can allocate enough RAM to keep up with the load. Disk,
&gt; on
&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, is less constrained.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; A little background on the data set: I have a sparsely accessed key set.
&gt; &gt;&gt; By that I mean after a key is written, the more time passes with that
&gt; key
&gt; &gt;&gt; not being accessed, the less likely it is to be accessed any time soon.
&gt; At
&gt; &gt;&gt; any given time, most keys will be dormant. However, any given key
&gt; \\_could\\_ be
&gt; &gt;&gt; accessed at any time, so should be possible to retrieve it.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am currently running a smaller cluster (with smaller nodes: less RAM,
&gt; &gt;&gt; smaller disks) than I expect to use eventually. I am starting to hit
&gt; some
&gt; &gt;&gt; growth-related issues that are prompting me to explore more options
&gt; before
&gt; &gt;&gt; it becomes a dire situation.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; My question: Are there ways to tune Riak (CS) to support this scenario
&gt; &gt;&gt; gracefully? That is, are there ways to make Riak not load all keys into
&gt; RAM?
&gt; &gt;&gt; It looks like leveldb is just what I want, but I'm a little nervous
&gt; &gt;&gt; switching over to only leveldb when the default/recommended config uses
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; multi backend.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; As a stop-gap measure, I enabled swap (with swappiness = 0), which I
&gt; &gt;&gt; anticipated would kill performance, but was pleasantly surprised to see
&gt; it
&gt; &gt;&gt; return to effectively no-swap performance levels after a short period of
&gt; &gt;&gt; lower performance. I'm guessing this is not a good long-term solution
&gt; as my
&gt; &gt;&gt; dataset grows. The problem with using large amounts of swap is that each
&gt; &gt;&gt; time Riak starts it needs to read all keys into RAM. Long term, as our
&gt; &gt;&gt; dataset grows, the amount of time needed to read keys into RAM will
&gt; cause a
&gt; &gt;&gt; very long restart time (and thus period of unavailability), which could
&gt; &gt;&gt; endanger availability for a prolonged period if multiple nodes go down
&gt; at
&gt; &gt;&gt; once.
