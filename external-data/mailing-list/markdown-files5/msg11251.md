Evening, Morning, Afternoon to All-

Mark here. I hope this Recap finds you well. We've got a lot to cover:
blogs, code, meetups in Baltimore and Silicon Valley, talks, videos, and
more.

Of prime importance: we just released the first wave of RICON East videos.
You can get to them via the shiny new Archive page:

http://ricon.io/archive/2013/east.html

We'll be rolling out ~5 new videos/week until they are done. And make sure
to grab a RICON West ticket before they sell out.

Enjoy, and thanks for being a part of Riak.
