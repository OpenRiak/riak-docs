Afternoon, Evening, Morning to All,

For today's Recap: new MapReduce code for Luwak, a new C driver, the
birth of "bashobot", and some questions from #riak.

Enjoy,

Riak Recap for Jan. 14 - 16

1) seancribbs and ossarah had a very brief chat in #riak that started
with "Is there some way, in a map phase, to fetch the object that a
link refers to?"

\\* Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/783629

2) Piotr Nosek has started work on another C Driver for Riak.

\\* Code on GitHub here ---&gt; https://github.com/fenek/riak-c-driver

\\* Added to the wiki here -
http://wiki.basho.com/Community-Developed-Libraries-and-Projects.html#Client-Libraries-and-Frameworks

Thanks, Piotr, for both the code and the wiki updating.

3) There is all sorts of good stuff happening with Luwak and MapReduce.

\\* Basho Hacker Bryan Fink put together something called "luwak\\_mr"
which will be a much-appreciated piece of code for anyone who is
trying to run MapReduce jobs over data in Luwak. Repo here ---&gt;
https://github.com/beerriot/luwak\\_mr

\\* He also added a function to Riak Function Contrib for doing
MapReduce over your Luwak data. Function here ---&gt;
http://contrib.basho.com/luwak\\_mr.html

\\*For those of you who aren't familiar with Luwak, see:
https://github.com/basho/luwak and http://wiki.basho.com/Luwak.html

4) Q --- Does riak support ttl expiration of objects? (from
heckacopter via #riak)

 A --- Yes. See "riak\\_kv\\_cache\\_backend" towards the bottom of
http://wiki.basho.com/Configuration-Files.html#app.config

5) Q --- Is it possible to implement transitive closures by link
walking? (from cirwin via #riak)

 A --- Hard to give a definite "no" without knowing exactly what
you're trying to do. However, if you're trying to compute reachability
between arbitrary objects in constant time using link walking, then
you'll probably want a more specialized graph database. Links weren't
made to handle these type of algorithms.

6) We have a new bot in #riak. Sean Cribbs wrote and released bashobot
- https://github.com/basho/bashobot/ - and it's now up and running in
#riak. Hop into the #riak IRC room on irc.freenode.net and type
"!help" to see it in action or check out the repo's README for a
complete list of commands.

7) Justin Sheehy answered a question on Quora about the nature of
buckets in Riak.
