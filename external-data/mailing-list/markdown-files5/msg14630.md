I like UUIDs for everything as well, although I expected compatibility issues with something. Base 64 encoding the binary value is a nice compromise for me, and takes 22 characters (if you drop the padding) instead of the usual 36 for the hyphenated hex format.It would still require re encoding all the keys, but it's a partial solutions.

There's not much we can do here at the moment, since we've yet to (if ever) support a custom interface to Solr that accepts arbitrary binary values. In the mean time, to use yokozuna, you'll have to encode your keys to utf8.

Here is the suggested schema from the documentation:


Would you expect this to work with Riak Search? I would hope so.(Or must keys be UTF-8 strings?)I get this error, which does not surprise me, given that the \\_yz\\_id is defined as a string:

I don't think changing the schema.xml type for \\_yz\\_id to "solr.UUIDField" is a good idea.What can I do?Thanks,David
