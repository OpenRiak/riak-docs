&gt;&gt; I guess I was hoping that someone could look at these results and say
&gt;&gt; "Given the use case and the hardware, Riak should be performing 10x what
&gt;&gt; you're seeing, so something is configured wrong." I'm not hearing that
&gt;&gt; though. What I'm hearing is "Is that a realistic use case?".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So given this use case, and the hardware I have, these are expected
&gt;&gt; results?

&gt;
&gt; Yea, I don't want to come of as dodging the question. I've seen lots of
&gt; people run benchmarks for use cases they don't even have. That doesn't
&gt; seem to be the case here.

Ryan, thanks. I appreciate your response. I'm waiting to hear back from
John this morning to see if I can engage one of your consultants to answer
the question for me.

Tim.
