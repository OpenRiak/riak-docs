Riak Recap for June 15 - 19
=====================

1) Francisco Treacy (@frank06) and the Riak-js crew tagged the 0.4.0
release today (and reached a bit of a milestone on GitHub).

\\* Details here ---&gt; https://twitter.com/#!/riakjs/status/82546215908155392

Congrats!

2) It would appear that Francisco had a busy weekend: he also released
a small query language for Riak that uses JSONSelect. By his own
admission it's not intended for production use, but it's certainly
worth taking a look at.

Code on GitHub here ---&gt; https://github.com/frank06/riak-ql

Thanks, Francisco!

3) Jon Brisbin updated his Riak and RabbitMQ custom exchange for the
2.5 release.

\\* Code here ---&gt; http://twitter.com/#!/j\\_brisbin/statuses/82814143488471040

4) Mark your calendars: it was just announced that Sean Cribbs
(@seancribbs) will be giving his "Wrap Your SQL Head Around Riak
MapReduce" talk at Strange Loop in September.

\\* Details here 
---&gt;http://twitter.com/#!/strangeloop\\_stl/status/82571355542929408

4) Basho CTO Justin Sheehy (@justinsheehy) gave a short and insightful
interview to RedMonk's @cote at Velocity last week. This one is all
about Riak, NoSQL, and Open Source.

Watch here ---&gt;

5) Ryan Zezeski (@rzezeski) just added a new entry to his Riak Core
working blog "Try Try Try." This installment is an extensive look at
eventual consistency and conflict resolution.

\\* Grab yourself a beverage of choice and settle in for a great read
---&gt;

6) They posted the slides from Marcus Kern's and David Dawson's Erlang
Factory Talk. This one is called "Erlang runs TV votes on Facebook"
and is well worth your time. (Slides 11-12 are my personal favorites.)

\\* Check them out here ---&gt;

7) fakepop contributed a small change to the Erlang bucket importer
function that's part of Riak Function Contrib.

\\* Function here on RFC ---&gt; http://contrib.basho.com/bucket\\_importer.html
\\* Diff here ---&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\\_function\\_contrib/pull/11/files

Thanks, fp!

8) We added a list of the various Riak recipes, cookbooks, and
configurations to the Wiki.

\\* Check it out here ---&gt;
http://wiki.basho.com/Community-Developed-Libraries-and-Projects.html#Recipes%2C-Cookbooks%2C-and-Configurations

If you know of any that I missed, please fork and add when you get the chance.

9) One new job to pass along.

\\* The awesome crew at Strobe is looking for a DevOps Engineer with
Riak experience ---&gt;
