I am thinking about how to possibly replace an existing system that has heavy
I/O load, low CPU usage, with riak. Its a file storage system, with smallish
files, a few K normally, but billions of them.

The architecture, I think, would be one riak node per disk on the hardware,
and probably run about 16 riak nodes per physical machine. Say I had
4 of these machines, which would be 64 riak nodes.

With something like this, if I set W=3 as a CAP tuning, I would want to make
sure that at least 2 of those writes where on 2 physically different machines,
so in case I had a hardware failure, and it took out a physical machine, I could
still operate with the other 3 machines.

Is something like this possible with riak?

enjoy,

-jeremy
