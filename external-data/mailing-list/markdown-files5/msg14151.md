&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; It would be good to see the state of JavaScript MapReduce on Riak improve. 
&gt; 
&gt; erlang\\_js [1], which is used for JavaScript MapReduce, is using an antiquated 
&gt; version of SpiderMonkey that is missing tens of features and significant 
&gt; performance improvements. E.g., Object.getOwnPropertyNames(), 
&gt; Function.bind(). 
&gt; 
&gt; There is a pull request to attempt to update it to a more recent old version 
&gt; [2].
&gt; 
&gt; I think it would be interesting to get Google's V8 [3] running as a Riak 
&gt; MapReduce back-end. Some Erlang wrappers for v8 already exist [4]. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any guidance or insight how one would go about writing a v8 
&gt; Riak MapReduce backend ? 

I would go a step further and say it would be \\*really\\* cool to have the M/R 
framework pluggable. One could spin up a JDK 8 Nashorn implementation (maybe 
even with a little Reactor integration thrown in for good measure ;) that 
communicated over jinterface and would like to the M/R framework like a normal 
Erlang process. Or one could use Clojure or other JVM language like Ruby, etc… 
ZeroMQ support would be cool here as well…using inproc or even over the 
localhost to something like Reactor [1] running in a JVM.

I'm currently playing with Reactor's Nashorn and network support such that I 
can make a Reactor participate in an Erlang topology with minimal static and 
Riak's M/R engine has been on my mind as a good way to test it.
