&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I've been looking at links and link walking and I noticed that Riak very 
&gt; often returns a special type of link with rel="up" instead of a riaktag, 
&gt; which is illegal for users to create.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the purpose of this link? (beyond the reasonably obvious "this key 
&gt; belongs to bucket X). Why was it added?
&gt; Are there other "rels" than "up"? 
&gt; Can they be followed through link walking?
&gt; 
&gt; This behavior is not documented anywhere that I (or Google) could find.

&gt; PS
&gt; Also, all the docs on links, even the 1.4 docs, still refer to the old 
&gt; "/riak/bucket/key" format for specifying a link target. Riak 1.3.1 rejects 
&gt; this format with a bad request error!
