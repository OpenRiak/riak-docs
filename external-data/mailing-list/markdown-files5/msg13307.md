&gt; Can anyone familiar with Riak internals describe how siblings are handled

&gt; As far as I understand, siblings are light at write time and resolved at
&gt; read time.
&gt;

No, the behavior in LevelDB is no different than the behavior of any of our
other backends, namely, all siblings occupy the same key. Every write
involves a fetch from the backend so that the existing value can be
superseded by or merged with the incoming write.
