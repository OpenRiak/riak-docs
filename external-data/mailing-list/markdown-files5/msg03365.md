The haskell client has now been patched to fix this problem, which boiled
down to it not consuming all the phases produced in a job.

The new interface to mapReduce is here:

Cheers to Brian for his swift application and cleanup of my patch!

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm playing with Riak via the haskell client, and I've run into a problem
&gt; with mapreduce. The gist of the problem is that once I've done one mapreduce
&gt; job with a connection, I only ever see results from that job.
&gt;
&gt; I've distilled it down to small example here (
&gt; https://gist.github.com/977611), which exhibits slightly different
&gt; behaviour to my application code. In the small example, I'm seeing results
&gt; from the second query twice. I think there might be something going on with
&gt; laziness, but it's beyond my ability to debug.
&gt;
&gt; Any pointers? This is somewhat specific to the haskell client, I hope this
&gt; is the right place to ask :)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
