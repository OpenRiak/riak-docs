Hi,
I have a follow-up question around this security aspect.

If the riak-cs.conf and stanchion.conf files are changed so that their
admin.key and admin.secret match a different user (eg. not that
first-created admin user) then will that user now have admin-like
privileges?

Or are the admin-abilities determined by something set in the admin user's
data in Riak?

Thanks,
Toby

&gt; Hi Toby,
&gt;
&gt; When you create the user, the data is stored in Riak (and is the
&gt; authoritative location). The values must match in the config files to
&gt; provide credentials used when connecting to various parts of your CS
&gt; cluster.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; In Riak CS, the admin key and secret is in the config files for both CS
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; Stanchion.
&gt; &gt; Is that the authoritative location for the secrets, or is the
&gt; &gt; initially-created admin user the source, and those just have to match?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I tried to figure this out from the source code, but my Erlang really
&gt; isn't
&gt; &gt; up to scratch :(
