&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I'm getting into a scenario where I'd like to use a secondary index on a 
&gt; particular field in my riak object/data. However the value of the field might 
&gt; change albeit very very rarely. So I was thinking I could just reindex using 
&gt; the new value. What's the right syntax to delete and add a new secondary 
&gt; index? A map-reduce approach would be great. I wouldn't mind a better 
&gt; alternative though.

Hi Jose,

Are you referring to just removing the index from the object? If so, you 
should be able to just read the object and rewrite it without the index 
metadata.
