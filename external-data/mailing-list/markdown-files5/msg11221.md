Hi Mark,


CrowdProcess is a web-based browser-powered distributed computing platform.

We harvest computing power from the browsers of the viewers of our
partner websites and make them available to our users and clients so
they can do all kinds of awesome stuff: forest fire behavioral
prediction, cancer therapy research, genome sequencing, etc. On top of
that we want to be an alternative revenue source for websites by sharing
our revenue in proportion to the processing power they're visitors allow
them to provide



That's an interesting concept. I had a quick look over your website too.

I wondered, is that figure of 700 GFLOP/s you quote as the aggregate 
performance able to be roughly comparable to the GFLOP/s used to rate 
performance of nvidia GPUs?

Or are they not really solving the same kind of problems?


Cheers,
Toby
