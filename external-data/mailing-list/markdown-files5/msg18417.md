Hi all,

I have created a Slack channel. Here is the invitation link[1]
I think it is better to have a quick talk beforehand in Slack to
organize big meeting with a rest of Riak funs/lovers.
We are ready to provide some resources and i believe lots of folks
would like to do the same.
It would be very efficient to organize, as fast as possible.
For anyone missed, there is an alternate mail group[2] if this one
ripped of suddenly.

&gt; Great idea Heinz, I think speaking together is the right start.
&gt;
&gt; I’m free next week, but a key member of our team is not. I know we’re never 
&gt; going to get everyone to agree on a time, but if we could do it early the 
&gt; following week it would suit more. Otherwise, I will attend and pass info 
&gt; along, so don’t worry. I think bet365 should be involved too. They probably 
&gt; have the largest team anywhere working on Riak.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe a doodle http://doodle.com/en\\_GB/ would be a good thing?

&gt;&gt; Heya everyone,
&gt;&gt; I figured I’ll pick up the initiative here and see if we all can come 
&gt;&gt; together before fragmentation hits. Annette mentioned this today and I think 
&gt;&gt; she’s right.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There are many people that want to see risk(\\_core) continue to evolve and 
&gt;&gt; improve, out of the top of my head there are ES - who picked up support for 
&gt;&gt; riak, NHS/UK - which is using it and seem to keep doing so, there is Gordon, 
&gt;&gt; Annette, Chris, Tristan, Mariano and me who all have an interest to keep 
&gt;&gt; things going. I’m pretty sure I forgot a good few people (sorry! It doesn’t 
&gt;&gt; mean I love you any less, I just have a brain like a sieve).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Amongst all of us I’m sure we’ve quite some forks. Tristan, Chris, Mariano 
&gt;&gt; and me started https://github.com/Kyorai to consolidate the git repos that 
&gt;&gt; correspond to the current hex packages as an example, NHS runs a fork of 
&gt;&gt; core at https://github.com/ramensen/riak\\_core and I guess ES will have one 
&gt;&gt; too by now. (Again apologies if I forgot someone).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am quite sure that all of us have the same goal and probably are 
&gt;&gt; interested in the same things (keeping riak(\\_core) strong). So what I’d like 
&gt;&gt; to suggest is we find a time to sit together and chat about how we pool 
&gt;&gt; resources instead of trying to cross merge in N different places. Perhaps 
&gt;&gt; late next week EU afternoon US morning? Please raise a hand if interested, 
&gt;&gt; discuss and share times that would work for you :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt; Heinz
