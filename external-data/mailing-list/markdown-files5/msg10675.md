Spent some time with the AWS folks the other day and was getting sold on 
using DynamoDB for some of our large Key Value store needs. However 
given the read/write economics of DynamoDB vs. Instance+Storage costs on 
Riak I was wondering if anybody has done a good thinking around where 
the cost inflections points are?


Also before I go and benchmark things how does Riak perform with 2B 
entries which are &lt; 1K in size, when I last did the benchmarks - just 
before 1.0 - there were a few issues.


Thanks,
David
