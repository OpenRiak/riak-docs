I saw composer.json in riak-php-client and google'd it (never heard of it
before). Installed it and ran it and changed my require to:
require\\_once('./riak-php-client/vendor/autoupdate.php');

Now I am getting this error:

 PHP Fatal error: Class 'RiakClient' not found in /root/storeinriak.php on
line 3

Digging further in I don't find any reference to RiakClient in any of the
src files, but I do find a Riak class. So I changed the source code to new
Riak('127.0.0.1'. '8098'); only to get the same error, but this time for no
Riak class.

Is this client library supported? Is anyone using it? I can't find much of
anything online when searching for any information about using this client
library. There is an example riak\\_php\\_app listed on the basho site from the
community, but it doesn't exist anymore on github. I found the doxygen docs
at Basho's website, but even they are out of date:
http://basho.github.io/riak-php-client/. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
coLLin

&gt; Hi folks, I am relatively new to Riak. I was trying to get something
&gt; working with the PHP client library by following the quick start in the
&gt; README.md. When I clone this repo (found here:
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-php-client) I do get a directory
&gt; called riak-php-client, but there is no riak.php in that directory. I
&gt; found a Riak.php in src/Basho/Riak/, but that doesn't work either. Are the
&gt; docs out of date? The example follows:
&gt;
&gt; require\\_once('riak-php-client/riak.php');
&gt;
&gt; # Connect to Riak
&gt; $client = new RiakClient('127.0.0.1', 8098);
&gt;
&gt; # Choose a bucket name
&gt; $bucket = $client-&gt;bucket('test');
&gt;
&gt; # Supply a key under which to store your data
&gt; $person = $bucket-&gt;newObject('riak\\_developer\\_1', array(
&gt; 'name' =&gt; "John Smith",
&gt; 'age' =&gt; 28,
&gt; 'company' =&gt; "Facebook"
&gt; ));
&gt;
&gt; # Save the object to Riak
&gt; $person-&gt;store();
&gt;
&gt; # Fetch the object
&gt; $person = $bucket-&gt;get('riak\\_developer\\_1');
&gt;
&gt; # Update the object
&gt; $person-&gt;data['company'] = "Google";
&gt; $person-&gt;store();
&gt;
