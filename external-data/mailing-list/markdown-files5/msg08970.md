&gt; d. you comment about using O\\_NOATIME is valid. The issue is that the flag 
&gt; is relatively new. We are supporting some really old compilers and 
&gt; linux/solaris versions. It is easier to ask everyone to work noatime at the 
&gt; mount level than have conditional code for some and mount level tuning for 
&gt; others. But your comment is still correct.
&gt;


isn't O\\_NOATIME per file open[1]? (while the mount option is per mount
point afaik.)

this might be a bit of performance drop in some cases using.


1. http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/open.2.html

O\\_NOATIME (Since Linux 2.6.8)
 Do not update the file last access time (st\\_atime in the
inode) when
 the file is read(2). This flag is intended for use by indexing or
 backup programs, where its use can significantly reduce
the amount of
 disk activity. This flag may not be effective on all
file systems.
 One example is NFS, where the server maintains the access time.

Istvan
