Hi Everyone,
 I am using Corrugated Iron(CI) for Riak in my WCF 
REST application. After adding CI, the web services started to send response 
very slow. All immediate consecutive request to the REST end points get queued 
up and the responses are delayed more. If anyone has implemented CI in the WCF 
project. Please advise me how to fix this issue.

Thanks and Regards
