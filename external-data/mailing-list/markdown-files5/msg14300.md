Thank you in advance for any assistance.

To explore riak-cs, I setup a 2 node cluster with riak and riak-cs on each 
node, and put the riak nodes on the same cluster. I then proceeded to use 
risk-cs by uploading a 3G file using the multi-part upload protocol. I was 
unaware, however, that I needed to finalize the multipart upload and thus had 
many in progress multi-part uploads. Through the duration of my 
troubleshooting, the storage on the filesystem grew to 224G. Once I discovered 
my error, I proceeded to cancel all of the previous uploads. At this point 
there are no uploads in progress, and only a single 3G file available in the 
bucket. However, it has been 48 hours since the exploration and the storage use 
is still 224G on both machines.

I have attempted multiple strategies in attempt to reclaim space, all without 
any effect.

Within riak-cs:

- I have shortened the gc leeway duration to 5 minutes and set all of the gc 
intervals as low as 5 minutes.
- I have manually triggered the riak-cs-gc batch multiple times. (After running 
batch, status shows a gc run and eventually complete)

Within riak:

- I have adjusted the bitcask settings in attempt to trigger a merge.
- I have force merged all of the bitcask partitions manually in the erlang 
console. 

None of these strategies seem to have any effect whatsoever.

At this point Iâ€™m not even sure where to start, nor do I know if the issue is 
within riak-cs or riak (via bitcask). Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks

Tyler
