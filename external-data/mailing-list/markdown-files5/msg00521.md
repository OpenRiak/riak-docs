Germain,

If you have enough excess capacity that your cluster will be safe with
one less machine for a little while, you can do this another way.

Just "riak-admin leave" one machine, wait for it to hand off all of
its data, "riak stop", set up that machine with a new
install/config-file/backend/etc, and then start and join it as though
it was a brand new node. Wait for it to get its share of data sent to
it in its new role, then repeat this process on the next node.
