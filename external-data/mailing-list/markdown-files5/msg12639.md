Hi everyone,

We'd sincerely appreciate it if you could take some time to complete
our \\*third\\* quarterly Riak and Riak CS community survey. Similar to
the last one, all contributors to the survey will be sent Basho swag
(if we still owe you swag for the last community survey, we didn't
forget about you â€“ it's coming):

We've gotten some great feedback from past community surveys, so
please keep it coming. If you have any questions or concerns, don't
hesitate to hit up .
