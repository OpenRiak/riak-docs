I am new to Riak. I have been having a problem with storing some plain text 
documents in Riak.
My test files consist of several lines of plain text. I store the content in 
Riak using the HTTP interface, e.g.

curl -v -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \\
 http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/test?returnbody=true --data @/tmp/data.txt

The content I get back from Riak appears to have had all the line breaks 
removed; I've also saved the output to a file from a GET request using the key 
that was generated from the above curl command. Any idea why the newline 
characters are removed? Is this behaviour correct or am I doing something 
wrong? I was expecting to get back exactly what I put in.

Thanks
Simon
