Hello Folks,

This is a fantastic beast of a recap with lots of great things to get to
this weekend. We just announced Riak KV 2.2.0. This new version brings a
host of goodies (with the requisite client libraries.) If you’re looking
for something new to try out before next week with the in-laws, give it a
try.

Are you working on something Riak related? Reply to me and I’ll get your
talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap. Perhaps you’re
interested in penning a guest post on the Basho blog? [0]
