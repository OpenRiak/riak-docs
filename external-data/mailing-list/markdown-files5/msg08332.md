Hey Patrick, 
You could try jumbo frames and it will buy you some extra CPU. We have done 
this in a couple of configurations and didn't notice anything crazy. Are you 
thinking increasing MTU might benefit in some other way, other than CPU. I'd be 
interested in knowing your thoughts/results if you test. 

What kind of switches are you using? 

Also, I have never tried Super Jumbo. 


Thanks, 


Sean

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I was just pondering a bit here - any pointers to think about in terms of MTU 
&gt; settings for a network with a riak cluster and clients? (let's ignore any 
&gt; other traffic on the network) It'd seem a good idea for MTU &gt; median/mean 
&gt; value size (when we're talking about value sizes that aren't huge, 
&gt; kilobytes), but then there's the internal chatter in the cluster etc and it's 
&gt; not obvious what the trade off is. 
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't see it discussed in the mailing list much before.
