Hi,

I have recently started using Riak and had a question about mapreduce 
queries.... is there a limit on the number of queries that could be run 
concurrently (per node / cluster etc)?

Also, does Riak optimize concurrent requests for the same mapreduce query / 
queries by returning results from a query in progress (or is there some way to 
cache query results for some short period of time and return the cached results 
if the query is re-issued within a timeout period)?

Thanks.\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_
