Some very important community business to take care of:

Basho's designer John Newman took some time to put together a few Riak
Badges that would make great additions to your site or app that happens to
be Riak-powered. They are on the Riak Wiki [1] and there's also a short
post about them on the Basho Blog [2].

They are beautiful. Your visitors will love them. Feel free to tell me/the
list that you've added one of them to your site.
