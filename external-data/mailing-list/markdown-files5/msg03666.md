&gt;&gt; Or if I could take a look at your mock system, maybe I could help with
&gt;&gt; some suggestions for moving in the direction I proposed?  We are
&gt;&gt; generally trying to move toward more well-defined APIs (such as
&gt;&gt; PBC/HTTP) and to discourage people from using distributed Erlang to
&gt;&gt; interact with Riak.
&gt;
&gt; Are these going to expose any of the server distribution to clients using
&gt; PBC/HTTP?  It just seems odd that an inherently distributed/masterless
&gt; system requires an intermediate load balancer/fail over mechanism instead of
&gt; having clients that know/learn how to round-robin and retry on their own.

We certainly have the desire to expose those features. Just a matter
of priorities.

I'll note that the erlang-distribution-based riak\\_client module being
discussed in this thread does not expose any of these features (load
balancing, failover) either, so nothing is "lost" by moving to the
others.
