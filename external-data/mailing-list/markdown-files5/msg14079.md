&gt; Riak Users,

&gt; There have been several issues people have ran into with Riak 2.0 pre's
&gt; and beta tags due to incompatibilities in different versions of Erlang.
&gt; For 2.0 we are building against R16B02, with our own patches put on top of
&gt; it. We are planning on documenting this on the docs page, but that page is
&gt; not updated yet.
&gt;
&gt; So, if you'd like to build 2.0 from source, here is the Erlang you should
&gt; build from:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/erlang/otp\\_src\\_R16B02-basho4.tar.gz
&gt;
&gt; If you'd like to see our patches, you can see what's changed here:
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/basho/otp/compare/erlang:maint...OTP\\_R16B02\\_basho4
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jared
&gt;

In addition to what Jared explained above, note that we submit all of our
Erlang/OTP patches to the Ericsson OTP team for inclusion in official
releases of Erlang/OTP. All of the Basho patches listed at the second link
above have already been incorporated into later versions of Erlang/OTP such
as R16B03-1 and 17.0.
