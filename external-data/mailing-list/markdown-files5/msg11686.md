You should be doing a GET before the PUT with the deletedvclock option.

Here is an example I used to originally test (and fix) this bug:

https://gist.github.com/Vagabond/965376#file-delete\\_bug-erl-L48

Sadly, because of backwards compatability issues, it was not possible to
default deletedvclock to be 'on'. Perhaps enough time has passed to
revisit that now. All the client libraries should understand the
message now.
