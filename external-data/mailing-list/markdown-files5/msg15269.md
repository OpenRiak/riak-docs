Happy Holidays Everyone:

I'm running Riak EE 1.4.7 and I've noticed that when performing handoffs,
multiple backends on the same vNode will transfer sequentially. That is to
say, if I have backend [A] and backend [B], and I initiate some action that
triggers ownership transfer, data will be migrated first out of [A] and
then out of [B] sequentially. This strikes me as suboptimal, as it isn't
impacted by the transfer-limit setting, and leads to slower than optimal
handoff times.

So, questions:

(1) Is this behavior different in 2.0?
(2) If it is not fixed in 2.0, is it on the roadmap for 2.1?
(3) If it's not on the roadmap, is it perhaps modifiable with a custom
patch that we write?

Thanks everyone.
