Next Tuesday (4/23) at the Atlanta Tech Village [0], Basho will be
holding the first Atlanta Riak meetup [1], as part of Big Data Week
[2]. We will be joined by John Vincent (@lusis), who will explain why
Riak matters as part of the bigger picture of systems engineering,
especially distributed systems.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, and if you
have any interest in giving a talk about your use of Riak at a meetup,
please drop me a note.

Hope to see you there!
