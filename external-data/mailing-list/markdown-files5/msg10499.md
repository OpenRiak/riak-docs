So you are using localhost (127.0.0.1) and I am not. That is the only
difference that I can see. Basho\\_bench will not work with 'remote' hosts?

I couldn't see your configuration. I got:

 

There is a problem with this website's security certificate.

I have attached an edited version of the config and output.

I'd recompare with the current 2i example config [1], you're missing the
operations section and have added an http\\_raw\\_ips second. Differences can be
here [2].

 

What's the reason for the differences between your config and the example
(outside of the IP config).

I reiterate the request to see what is wrong with my basho\\_bench
configuration. I have attached the configuration as well as the output. Any
ideas as to what is wrong would be greatly appreciated. I basically used
the templates in the 'examples' folder but apparently there is something
wrong.
