Hello Gang,

For your viewing pleasure this weekend we’ve got a big product bump - Riak
TS 1.4 - with an equally large bump to the Riak Java Client to check out
along with the effervescent mailing list recap. Take those brand new bits
out for a spin.

As always, let us know your thoughts: If you’re working on or speaking
about something Riak related and would like a mention, let me know. I’ll
get your talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap. I know a guy.

## Announcements


 -

 Riak TS 1.4. There’s lots of new stuff here to get through. GROUP BY
 [0], ISO8601 support [1] and a global TTL [2] are just some of them. Check
 out the release notes [3] and give it a try [4]. As always, lots of props
 to all the engineers involved in making this happen: support, docs,
 product, time series team, performance and all our users who contributed
 along the way. Congrats!
 -

 Riak Java Client 2.0.7 comes stacked with features, fixes and Riak 1.4
 support. Check out the release notes [5], maven [6], the all in one jar [7]
 and the API docs [8].

## Recently Answered

 (and the rest of us) know that the Go client only speaks protobuff. Go
 figure.
 -

 notes on the process and enhancements to the documentation [11]. Thanks for
 your input Chris!



## Open Discussions


 -

 Ali Rıza KELEŞ is looking to use 3 of his 7 Riak nodes as CS instances
 and how to appropriately configure his riak.conf/advanced.config files to
 accomplish this [12]. This is a good time to chime in and simply say Riak
 doesn’t work that way. One does not simply dictate where data resides in
 Riak [13]. In other words, you can’t tell Riak to restrain data to a subset
 of nodes. Create a dedicated cluster.
 -

 Kyle Nguyen is working through some certificate based auth issues with
 the Java client [14] and Jonathan Joseph helped with details on how to turn
 on SSL debugging [15].
 -

 Magnus Kessler helps “!” with a some high I/O concerns [16]. “!”, please
 add some more info to your request!
 -

 Hawk Newton is looking for some guidance on how best to detect Hinted
 Handoff programmatically vs parsing the command line output [17].
 -

 Chris Johnson runs into an overload error in Riak TS [18] and continues
 a conversation on how best to deal with it, take a look at the github issue
 [19].



Have a fantastic weekend,
