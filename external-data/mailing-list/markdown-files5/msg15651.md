The only thing I can think of is that your flattened full name is not being 
matched. Also looking at Basho’s default schema, it should be “\\_yz\\_str” and 
not “yz\\_str”, and that only works if you actually have it defined as:


 



in your schema file. The data types for solr are all class names as in solr.\\*. 
I would double check your mappings for name, type, and if they are being 
indexed and stored. If stored is false, you won’t get the data back but you can 
query on it.

Hi Shawn,
I am using plain old types. Some of the fields we index ends with Id like 
execId, verId, orderId and are defined as long. There are some that has random 
strings which are defined as yz\\_str. Do you think this fields can cause issues ?

Surprisingly, i am seeing some data and some are not present in the Solr. I 
can understand if no data is found for some field but the fact being i am 
seeing some data.

Also, Is there any suggestions around AAE configuration for production cluster?

Nirav, are you using CRDTs or plain old types with Riak? The definition for 
field names makes a big difference in what gets archived and solr will not 
complain if it couldn’t find matching fields, it just won’t index them. You can 
take a peek at the data dir on the Riak instance to see what, if any, is being 
indexed.

Hi Luc,
Thanks for the response.

Here are the steps i performed on my application start up. I am using the 
default bucket type in my application

1. Create Custom Schema

 String schema = Source.fromInputStream(inputStream, 
"UTF-8").mkString(); (inputStream comes from a schema file that 
i read)

 YokozunaSchema yokozunaSchema = new YokozunaSchema("test", 
schema.toString());
 StoreSchema storeSchema = new 
StoreSchema.Builder(yokozunaSchema).build();
 riakClient.execute(storeSchema);


2.Post creation of Schema

 I created Index for my Object based on the required fields as mentioned in 
the Riak Search docs and other fields as mapped to my object. I have only 
few fields set to be Indexed and Stored from my object as i only want to 
search on them

 YokozunaIndex yokozunaIndex = new YokozunaIndex("test\\_idx", "test");
 StoreIndex storeIndex = new StoreIndex.Builder(yokozunaIndex).build();
 riakClient.execute(storeIndex);


3.Set Bucket Properties

 I than associate my bucket to the Index as part of the same application 
start up. Before i attach Index to my bucket, i verify if it has already 
been attached using a Fetch
 StoreBucketProperties sbp =
 new StoreBucketProperties.Builder(namespace)
 .withAllowMulti(false)
 .withLastWriteWins(true)
 .withSearchIndex("test\\_idx")
 .build();
 riakClient.execute(sbp);

Nirav

Nirav,

Could you possibly detail the steps you used to upload the schema, adjust the 
bucket properties, etc.? That would help us identify the issue.

Hi Shawn,
Thanks for the response. To give you some background

1. We are using custom schema with default bucket type
2. I have the search set to on:)
3. I have associated BucketProperties/Index to my buckets..
4. What i am seeing is, i am getting data back, but for some reason i am not 
getting the entire set. When i query RIAK i see the data, however when i query 
the solr indexes, its missing that data. At this point, i don't know what can 
cause this and am looking for people who might have faced similar issues.

My default config is just changing search=on in riak.conf, changed the JVM 
settings in riak.conf for Solr.


Would appreciate any pointers and best practice around settings for Riak Search 
and AAE in production cluster that i should add that folks have running in 
production cluster.

Nirav

Hi Nirav,

About your last point. Just yesterday I started playing with Search 2.0 (solr) 
and riak. Basho did a good job at integrating the solr platform but docs are 
sometimes misleading. One thing I found out was the using the default schema 
provided by Basho, if you are using CRDTs, your fields are suffixed with 
\\_register, \\_counter, \\_set. This link 
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/search/search-data-types/) has a good 
set of examples but best is to experiment. I ended up diving into the data dir 
of solar and grep’ed for parts of my field names to figure out what it actually 
was. When running queries, solr/riak will not let you know that fields are 
incorrect, it just doesn’t have any data for those so it returns no search 
results.

Good luck.

Shawn

PS. Be sure to have search=on in riak.conf :)

Hi All,
Just wanted to check what kind of configuration settings does everyone use in 
production clustered environment for Riak Search/AAE and if someone can share 
some experience over it? We currently have a 2g memory allocated to Solr and 
are currently just using the default parameters from riak.conf.

What we have seen so far is that there is data in RIAK but somehow, Solr/Riak 
search does not return it. I am trying to find out what can cause this and am i 
missing some kind of configuration settings.



Any response would be appreciated.
