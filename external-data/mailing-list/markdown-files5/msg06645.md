Hi Brian

Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for!
Somehow I missed setting up options in DomainBucketBuilder.

I'm using domain buckets as I'm updating existing keys and I have to do
merging/mutation with existing value.
Domain bucket seemed like a good option (simpler?) than using any other
client interface. I may be wrong here thought as I haven't used Riak client
much so far. Is it much more complicated to do merging custom objects when
using FetchObject, StoreObject? I don't want to replicate code that is
written (I assume) for that purpose in DomainBucket.

Also, could you point me to a place where I could read more about meaning
and potential pitfalls of rw, pr, pw?

Thanks
Daniel
