Riak Recap for January 26 - 30
=======================

1) For anyone in or around Austin, TX: they just opened up the CFP for
"Devopsdays Austin" happening in April. I'm sending stickers and
t-shirts to anyone who submits a Riak-related talk.

2) There is a new question up on StackOverflow about using Bitcask
that needs an answer if anyone has a moment.

ScaleConf last week. Thanks to all of you for making our community
worth presenting on. :)
