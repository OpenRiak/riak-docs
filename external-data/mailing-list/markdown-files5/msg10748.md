Hi,

i run some tests with riak for a study case, before i run the tests i have
to clear or delete the data i generated in the last run. At moment i have
a map reduce job for this which works, but gets extremly slow when there
are a lot of keys in the bucket.

In Cassandra i could empty the data folder. Now i would like to ask if it
is possible to empty the /var/lib/riak/bitcask folder on every node, to
delete the data in the database?


greetings Christian
