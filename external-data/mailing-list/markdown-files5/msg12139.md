Hi all,

RICON [1] is Basho's celebration at the intersection of theory and
practice in distributed systems. RICON West [2] in San Francisco is
fast approaching.

Our early bird pricing [3] ends early Thursday morning. At $299 a
ticket, we're making attendance as painless as possible, but this is
your last chance to take advantage of that price. It's time to get
serious about attending \\*the\\* definitive distributed systems
conference.

Come see some of the brightest minds in academia and industry: Jeff
Dean, Pat Helland, Peter Bailis, Justin Sheehy, to drop some (big)
names. See our RICON West [2] page for a full list of speakers.

If you need a flavor of what RICON is like, watch some of our archived
talks [4]. As jaw-dropping as many of those are, the in-person
experience of hobnobbing with your peers and the people redefining the
future of distributed computing must be experienced.

This fall we're adding a day-long training session [5] before the
conference gets into gear. Come gain hands-on experience with Riak
and learn about data modeling that can make the difference between
mediocre and stellar performance in your application.

Come add your voice to the conversation. RICON is not to be missed.
October. San Francisco. Be there.
