Hi,

I'm still new to the underpinnings of working with MapReduce in Riak. 
That being said I think what you're looking for is possible, though I'm 
sure someone else might be able to share a better way with you.


Using some custom code( 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/install-custom-code/) you 
could write what you're looking for.


\\_NOTE\\_, this is untested... you've been warned!

getMetaData(RiakObject, \\_KeyData, \\_Arg) -&gt;
 Key = riak\\_object:key(RiakObject),
 Data = riak\\_object:get\\_metadata(RiakObject),
 [ {Key, Data} ].

Hello:

I'm trying to understand how to do a map/reduce referring to meta-data.
Example (I'm using JavaScript).

I have a meta-data field called X-Riak-Meta-start-time; the contents of which 
are a Unix timestamp.
I'd like to find all keys with a timestamp older than now() - 30 days ago.
Reading through the documentation this seems to be straight forward if I was 
looking at the actual data being stored, however, I'm simply unclear as to how 
to do while looking at a MetaData field.

Appreciate any help you can provide.
