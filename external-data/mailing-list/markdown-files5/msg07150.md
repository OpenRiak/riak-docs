Wow. These tools are very helpful! I was messing with make rel and
was trying to work with cowboy and riak together. So I was starting
riak then starting cowboy inside of riak so cowboy could talk to riak
with search:searchdoc. With the previous help here, I now have cowboy
as part of the release and when I do riak start, cowboy starts.

awesome!

Anyway, how do you make changes, i.e., I make changes to a cowboy
default\\_handler.erl and then I have to stop riak, remove the old riak
folder, do make rel again, add my test data, then riak start to test
the changes. Is there a different work flow in doing this? I could
just edit the default\\_handler and copy the beam to the
rel/riak/lib/... folder.

Thanks!
