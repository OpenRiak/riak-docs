Hi,

In Bob Ippolito's talk at InfoQ about Statebox Andy says in the end "not to be 
surprised" to see something similar to Statebox in Riak (as higher level API or 
something). I'm sure there are efforts to offer CRDTs as part of Riak. I know 
there is also Eric Moritz's projects. I'm wondering what the situation 
currently looks like, what to expect or not to. I'm particularly interested in 
the Erlang side of things.

Cheers
- Tilman
