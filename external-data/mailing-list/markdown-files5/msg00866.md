Hello,

I've examined couple of articles about schema design for Riak, but none of
them
cover the sorting topic.

I have the following use case - a bucket holds a series of blog posts and I
need
to retrieve the 5 most recent ones. In relational world I would just sort on
the
"created" field, in the nosql world I'll use map/reduce.

So, using a naive map/reduce function I will map the document's creation
date and then
sort by it. But this will scan the whole bucket and probably will be a very
expensive operation.

What will be a recommended solution for Riak?

Thanks, Nickolay
