I'm interested to see how 2.0 fixes this. I too have been bit by the AAE 
killing servers problem and have had to turn it off (which is thankfully the 
easiest of the AAE config options). It's kind of antithesis to the easy ops 
proposition of Riak when a feature that is difficult to configure can kill your 
entire cluster. Like not just make it slow but like make it unresponsive.
