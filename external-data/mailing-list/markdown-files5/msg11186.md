Guys,

I released version 0.4 of Raiku some days ago. 
0.4 is a major release, focused on further stabilisation of the client and API.

Raiku is a non-blocking performance focused Riak client for Scala. 
The client is completely actor based, running on the Akka 2.2 IO implementation.

Changes
- Values are now returned as a typed RaikuValue, which make it able to use the 
additional metadata from Riak if needed;
- Functionality has been added for the implementation of custom mutators and 
resolvers;
- Overall stability and performance has been improved through the new Pipeline 
implementation;
- The 'ValidatedFutureIO' monad has been replaced by a new 'Task' 
implementation, combining both monadic as co-monadic behaviour.

Check it out at: https://github.com/gideondk/raiku

Cheers,
