Hello, 



I have run into a situation whereby I started seeing: 


[error] emulator Too many processes 


when some of our new jobs ran. These jobs are in perl using Net::Riak, 
communicating to the cluster via PBC. They fire tens of thousands of fetchs and 
stores over the course of about 20 minutes. 


Our cluster has five nodes with 1.3, using eLevelDB. 


I have been raising the limit (+P in vm.args) in increments from the default of 
32768. Currently at 524288, and that is still not high enough. 


Have any of you had to increase this limit? 


Thanks! \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_
