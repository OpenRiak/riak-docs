Hello,

I'm using recent versions of Riak on CentOS 6.5 and I ran into some issues 
which are similar to these ones reported on Debian:

https://github.com/basho/riak\\_cs/issues/718

In my case, instead of having problems during startup, I get problems during 
shutdown, because for some reason riak and stanchion are shutting down before 
riak-cs. It causes very long timeouts of 30-60+ seconds or more every time you 
try to reboot the machine involved.

So I wanted to ask how I could modify the scripts or dependency ordering 
manually, on the local system, to prevent this problem, even if it can't be 
done globally due to the "all parts of Riak can go on arbitrary nodes" issue 
mentioned in the bug above.

Thanks,
Matthew.
