Riak Recap for September 3 - 6
=======================

1) Nick Campbell (@ncb000gt) built an app using Riak and Luwak for
Node Knockout.

\\* Go see if you can break it here ---&gt; http://bearshark.nko2.nodeknockout.com/
\\* A few details on the app here ---&gt;

Anyone else use Riak for a Node Knockout app?

2) Juliano Martinez let it leak that he added support for Riak to the
S3 Clone he is working on.

\\* Code here on GitHub ---&gt; https://github.com/ncode/otto

3) Chad DePue (@chaddepue) wrote a great blog post about his
experience using and working with Riak over the past year.

\\* Read here ---&gt; http://inakanetworks.com/blog/2011/08/25/when-to-use-riak/
\\* There was also a lively discussion about the post on Hacker News
---&gt; http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2969865

4) Jon Brisbin's talk from Erlang Factory about Riak and RabbitMQ is
online (PDF and video).

5) I wrote up a blog post detailing all the Riak-related events in September.

6) Two Common Lisp Libraries for Riak appeared today (obviously both
are still quite nascent but definitely worth keeping an eye on).

7) Two great jobs to pass along:

\\* HP Cloud Services in Seattle is hiring developers with Riak skills
