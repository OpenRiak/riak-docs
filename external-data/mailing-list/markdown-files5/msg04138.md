I second the motion!


BTW, as a side discussion, it may be possible to emulate that functionality
with map/reduce, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as powerful/versatile as
if the functionality were directly built into Riak... Not sure if emulation
via map/reduce would even be worth the effort to consider.

&gt; Could it be possible to have "SuperColums" as Cassandra has? (
&gt; "SuperBuckets" would be more ideal name )
&gt; I think it would be a great improvement if we can query a bucket without
&gt; having to look at all buckets and keys in memory to search for it... this
&gt; way it would be easier and faster to modulate data so if you distribute data
&gt; in small buckets, the MapReduce on them would get faster... not sure if is
&gt; possible to implement, but is something i really would love to have in Riak
&gt; and it would help me a lot in my project... knowing that atomizing buckets (
&gt; "rohman\\_messages", "fyodor\\_messages" ) has no advantage over a huge
&gt; "messages" bucket really disappointed me.
&gt; thanks
