Hi,

I'm very new to NoSQL/KV database systems. Sean's webinar "Schema Design
for Riak" http://vimeo.com/17604126 gave me some idea about how to move to
kv database, but I feel I need some more advice/docs to fully grasp this
new concept for me.

I was thinking about developing a blog application using Riak. Which schema
would be most effective for that kind of application (regular blog: content
+ comments):

 bucket\\_blogs -&gt; blog content;
 bucket\\_blogs\\_comments -&gt; comments for the blogs in the bucket\\_blogs

or,

 bucket\\_blogs -&gt; JSON("blog": &lt;&gt;, "comments": &lt;&gt;)?

 The second option seems less effective if number of comments grow
significantly. But I'm not sure. Any hints? Ideas?

Thanks!
