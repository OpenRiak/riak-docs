Hi everyone,
I saw in the documentation for the Java client that the FetchDatatype.Response 
object has a method called hasContext() that checks to see if the causal 
context was present on the fetch response. Are there any situations where a 
causal context won't be returned besides if the object being fetched doesn't 
exist?
Thanks,
Michael
