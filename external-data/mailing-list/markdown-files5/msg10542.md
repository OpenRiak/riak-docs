Handoff is done by default on port 8099.

I guess what I am getting at here is that this doesn't look like an
obvious riak problem, it's more likely that something on your network
or on your nodes is closing or interrupting those sockets; you'd most
likely get a different error if something internal to riak was causing
the transfers to fail.

&gt;
&gt; So I guess Riak use only port 8097 internally, without any limitation.

&gt; And by checking logs, I see that a vnode transfer fails after a random
