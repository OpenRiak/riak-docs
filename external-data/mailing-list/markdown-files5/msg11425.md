Hello Evgeniy,

The consistency mechanisms, Hinted Handoff, Active Anti-Entropy (AAE) and
Read Repair, all occur automatically. You can get an overview of the
Hinted Handoff progress using `riak-admin transfers`. If you need more
detail, you can parse the cluster logs and look for the entries related to
Hinted Handoff and AAE. As Read Repair is done on a per-request basis, it
is not logged.

Hope that helps,

Best,
Todd

&gt; Hello gentlemen!
&gt;
&gt; Lets say we have a cluster of 6 machines. Somewhere in time 3 machines (A
&gt; part) got separated from 3 other machines (B part). After that I did some
&gt; commits on B part (w = 3, handoff occured).
&gt;
&gt; Later the network partitioning has gone. A and B parts are now connected
&gt; again. One of consistency mechanisms will start to do its job to make DB
&gt; consistent.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Do I have any chance to be acknowledged when this consistency thing
&gt; will finish its job?
&gt;
&gt; 2. More generally, do you think that such mechanism might be useful for
&gt; end users?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your effort.
&gt;
&gt; Evgeniy.
