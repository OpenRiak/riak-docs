Hi,

I am using riaksearch with erlang client and i have made an API that does
for the select, insert and other such stuffs. I have built an web
application on top of it and everything works fine when i do the manual
testing.

But now when i am using the automated load testing through Tsung by sending
100 req/sec, the riak shuts down after few seconds. Does anybody know why
this is happening or how much requests can riak handle in a second. I am
using only single node currently.
