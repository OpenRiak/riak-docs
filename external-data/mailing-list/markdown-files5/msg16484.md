Hi,

What's the maximum seconds to wait after creating an search index and 
before setting it on the bucket?


On my local machine, I only need to wait 1 second, sometimes I feel I 
don't need to wait at all, but on a production server which is basically 
zero traffic, I have to wait about 10 seconds(definitely over 5s) before 
I can set the index on a bucket.


I am using riakc\\_pb\\_socket client. At first I thought something wrong 
with my function to "create" and "set" the index but then when I split 
the process, it's fine. So seems it's the interval in between that matters.


I need to know how long is the maximum because I need to restore a lot 
of buckets and set index on them via a script. I don't care how long it 
takes but I don't want it to miss any index not being set on the bucket.


The exact error on the console when I set the index on a bucket is

&lt;&lt;"Invalid bucket properties: [{search\\_index,\\n 
&lt;&lt;\\"application\\_test\\_player\\_idx does not exist\\"&gt;&gt;}]"&gt;&gt;





Thanks,
