 Known Issues


 
leveldb
 1.3 to 1.4 conversion

The first execution of 1.4.0 leveldb using a 1.3.x or 1.2.x dataset will 
initiate an automatic conversion that could pause the startup of each 
node by 3 to 7 minutes. The leveldb data in "level #1" is being adjusted 
such that "level #1" can operate as an overlapped data level instead of 
as a sorted data level. The conversion is simply the reduction of the 
number of files in "level #1" to being less than eight via normal 
compaction of data from "level #1" into "level #2". This is a one time 
conversion.



HTH,

Guido.

Hi,
some of our nodes upgraded to Riak 1.4.0, and are now refusing to start and 
join the cluster.
Is there documentation on the upgrade path from 1.3.2 to 1.4.0? It appears we 
have accidentally begun this journey, and I don't know if it's easier to go 
back or forwards now..

PS. It would have been pleasant to receive a warning about the new version on 
the mailing list!

Thanks,
Toby
