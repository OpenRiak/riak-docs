&gt; &gt; Given that all of the code except for MDC (and maybe JMX) is under
&gt; &gt; Apache 2, I would assume that those components would follow the
&gt; &gt; already existing license of the other components.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there a plan to change the original license on the open source
&gt; &gt; product from Apache 2?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; A quick status update. Today bet365 have signed the agreement to
&gt; purchase all Basho IP. We expect the agreement to be ratified in the US
&gt; courts next week. Once cleared, our intention is to open source all code,
&gt; help rebuild the community and collaboratively take the development of RIAK
&gt; forward.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; In the coming weeks we will hopefully answer the questions people have
&gt; and will be calling on the community to help forge the initial RIAK Roadmap.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; One of the initial questions we have for the community is which OSS
&gt; license would people like applied to the code? Our thought is the most open
&gt; and permissive.
&gt; &gt;&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been wanting to make you aware for a few weeks now that we
&gt; have reached an agreement, in principle, to buy all of Basho's remaining
&gt; assets (except support contracts) from the receiver. Up until this
&gt; afternoon, I was constrained by some confidentiality needs of the receiver
&gt; and was unable to speak.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; We have agreed a price for the assets and are almost at the end of
&gt; sorting out the legal agreement. Once this is complete, this will then need
&gt; to be processed through the courts which, I am advised, should take a week
&gt; or so.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; It is our intention to open source all of Basho's products and all
&gt; of the source code that they have been working on. We'll do this as quickly
&gt; as we are able to organise it, and we would appreciate some input from the
&gt; community on how you would like this done.
