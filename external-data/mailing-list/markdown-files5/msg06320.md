In small clusters, yes, it might be possible for multiple replicas to live
on the same node, which is why we typically recommend 4 or more nodes
minimum. That said, there are successful 3 node clusters running in
production.

&gt; &gt; The ring size must be a power of two because it must evenly divide 2^160
&gt; &gt; (the size of our consistent hashing space), which is not divisible by 3.
&gt;
&gt; That makes sense.
&gt;
&gt; Was my assumption about placement of the copies on one physical node
&gt; correct though?
&gt; Just to be sure what to expect...
