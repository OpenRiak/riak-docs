&gt; Not sure if this has been asked before - given a map, how does one go
&gt; about retrieving the key of the map?
&gt;
&gt; For example, in Riak example for map
&gt; , a map
&gt; is created with "ahmed\\_info" key.
&gt;
&gt; If we were to write a commit hook in Erlang where we want to do some kind
&gt; of action based on the key, it will be helpful to have a way to extract the
&gt; key.
&gt;
&gt; I looked in basho erlang client documentation here for map, but don't see
&gt; any function to extract the key. Perhaps we have to do pattern match to
&gt; extract the key?
&gt; http://basho.github.io/riak-erlang-client/riakc\\_map.html
&gt;
&gt; I also see erlang libraries under riak installation (one of them
&gt; "riak\\_object" is called in "commit hook" example in documentation) - I can
&gt; check there as well if there is online documentation somewhere for them.
&gt;
&gt; I am thinking of storing user info as immutable maps, something like
&gt; \\_\\_, and have an erlang commit hook that updates
&gt; \\_\\_ map with the latest entry. For that, we need to
&gt; extract the map key.
&gt;

Hi Sanket,

The actual association between an Erlang CRDT object and a bucket-type,
bucket, and key has to be done separately from creating the object itself.
Please have a look at the "counters" example on the same page.

I agree that this could be documented better and have mentioned your
question to our documentations team.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
