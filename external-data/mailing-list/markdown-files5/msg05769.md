6) Q --- Are people running riak natively on osx (for development) or
running on a vm that matches production? (from kenperkins via #riak)

 A --- Anyone? (We had a similar thread on the list several months
back about this but I figured it couldn't hurt to open it up to more
discussion.)


We've got a few devs who use riak on OSX for development here, but not 
heavily. ulimit appears to be a capricious liar on that platform, at 
least from the issues we've encountered. :/


I do most of our riak-facing development, and use Ubuntu and Debian as 
my everyday dev OS. No VMs. We deploy to Ubuntu server.
