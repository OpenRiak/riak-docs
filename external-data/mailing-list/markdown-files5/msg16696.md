Anyone?

I note that after 24 hours (on a very lightly loaded test cluster) I'm
still seeing these scroll by a lot - 600 an hour per node.
Really curious to know if this is expected behaviour or if this is
resulting from some kind of node corruption.

Cheers
Toby

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I've been working on getting Riak to run inside Docker containers - in a
&gt; multi-machine cluster. (Previous work I've seen has only run Riak as a
&gt; cluster all on the same machine.)
&gt; I thought I had it cracked, although I tripped up on the existing issue
&gt; with Riak and lockfiles[1]. But the nodes have been generating an awful lot
&gt; of errors like the below, and I wondered if anyone here can give me an
&gt; explanation? (And, is it a problem?)

&gt; 1: Related issues to the lockfiles --
&gt; I note that many are closed, but the problem still exists, and is
&gt; particularly triggered by using Docker and stopping/killing Riak more
&gt; violently than it likes.
