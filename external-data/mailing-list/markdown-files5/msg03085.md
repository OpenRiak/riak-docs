Believe it or not, I'm actually using this ping-pong as a feature. :) I can 
asynchronously store a document and pass it to the next item in the chain via 
postcommit hook, which might, at some point later, send another message that 
gets persisted somewhere else.

But if you're not careful, it's easy to set up a test scenario where you're 
infinitely passing stuff between the components. :)

Thanks!
