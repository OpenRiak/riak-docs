Hi,

Thanks for your reply.

I don't think that write\\_once is going to work for us as we have to
periodically update the data (although if we remove the data before
re-inserting it, would that work?)

Why does read-before-write slow down new writes so much?

Some new information we've found - it seems that if we write the data and
then update it, we get fast speeds too. It's just the initial write of the
data that is slow.

So why is writing sequential keys so much slower than updating them or
writing non-sequential keys?
