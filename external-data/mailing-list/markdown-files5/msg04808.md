&gt; Hi Jon,

&gt; Thanks for getting back to me.

&gt; I'm doing full-text indexing, but I don't need to keep the text around once 
&gt; my object has been indexed, so I wrote a second precommit hook to remove the 
&gt; text from the object. This reduces the size of my objects drastically (since 
&gt; text tends to be the largest part) and has given us substantial perf gains in 
&gt; our tests.
&gt; 

I just pushed a fix for this. It should be present in the next 1.0
prerelease.
