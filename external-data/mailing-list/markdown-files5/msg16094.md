Hello Everybody,

I am trying to setup a single node Riak cluster and want to use a loopback
address (127.0.0.x) for the Handoff IP to keep the instance private and
invisible to others.

But the Riak node fails to start and throws an error - "handoff.ip
invalid, must be a valid IP address"

Is it illegal to use loopback interface for Handoff IP? Came across some JIRA
issues  but couldn't find a
solution with out having to build packages from source.

Any workarounds? I am trying to use Riak 1.4.12 on Ubuntu 14.04!

Any advice in this regard will be greatly helpful.

Thank you.

Praveen
