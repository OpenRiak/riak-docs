Hello all, riak shell newbie here. I have a cluster running Riak 1.0.0 which is 
showing duplicate entries in its ring\\_member list.

E.g. I have 'riak@192.168.10.22' listed multiple times when I do 'riak-admin 
member\\_status'. If I tell the node to leave or force-remove it, only one entry 
is removed from the list.

&gt;From looking at the docs it appears that there's a function 
&gt;http://basho.github.io/riak\\_core/riak\\_core\\_ring.html#remove\\_member-3 which can 
&gt;be used to remove a member from the ring. I'm wondering how to call that from 
&gt;an erlang shell and also if that's the best/only option?

Basically, I just want to forcibly remove the node through any means necessary. 
Please let me know if more information is needed. Thanks in advance.
