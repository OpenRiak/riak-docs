Dear Riak community,

I am a PhD student who is trying to build a system to find latent scalability 
problems that cannot be found in small-scale cluster.
(So offline test cannot find them, but users experience them when they deploy 
on large scale like 100/1000 machines)

I would love to see past interesting bugs so I started to dig in to bug report 
of Riak and mailing list.
However, it would be good if someone can point me to past interesting bugs 
related to scalability.
So is there anyone experienced scalability bugs in the past?
If possible can you tell me what problems you faced.

I appreciate your help.
Thank you.

Best,
Tanakorn L.
