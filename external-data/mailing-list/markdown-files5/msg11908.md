I've been looking through the changes to the RiakClient class - and have a
question about the nodes list and RiakNode/Decaying class.

It seems that the Decaying class is used internally to track error\\_rates
(request failure\\_rate?) of nodes in the available pool.

In the application I maintain, we're accessing Riak in many concurrent
celery workers - so my assumption would be that this internal error\\_rate
tracking wouldn't do much good. Have I got this right? Is the client's
internal "nodes" list only really useful in a long running application?
(ie, when I'm not instantiating RiakClient fresh for each query).

We currently have a "pool" of Riak nodes in some configuration, from which
a random IP is chosen for each request.

Thanks
