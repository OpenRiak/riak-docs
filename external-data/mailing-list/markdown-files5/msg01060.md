Riak Recap for 9/7 - 9/9

1) We added a new Community Editor to the Riak Wiki. His name is Seth
Falcon (sfalcon on IRC).

You can see his name in flashing lights on the Wiki here ---&gt;

2) Rusty Klophaus' Riak Search Talk from Berlin Buzzwords has finally
surfaced. This one is 29 minutes of awesomeness, not to mention his
slide-making ability is enviable.

3) Someone asked this question on Stack Overflow ---&gt;
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3669653/how-can-i-implement-pre-and-post-commit-hooks-in-riak

So we added some code to the wiki that hopefully clears things up ---&gt;

4) For those of you in San Francisco (or looking for a reason to come
to San Francisco) we announced the lineup for this month's Riak
meetup:

5) mheld, seancribbs, bingeldac and lypanov had a chat in #riak that
started with recommendations for RAID configuration in a small Riak
cluster and then slid into best naming conventions for machines - on
a related note, seancribbs probably has a scary amount of knowledge
related to burrowing animals.

6) Q --- Is there a way to remove links after they have been made
through the HTTP API? (from jamesduncan via #riak)

 A --- Get the objects with the links, remove the ones you want
from the list on the client side, and then send it back to Riak.

7) Q --- Will the REST interface be as fast as the provided APIs? Or
is the API a REST specific implementation for Riak? (from pouete via
#riak)

 A --- The protobuf interface is faster in terms of pure throughput
than the HTTP interface. Depending on your setup, that may or may not
make it the better choice, as HTTP has other benefits.

8) seancribbs and jjthrash had a short exchange in #riak about the
performance implications of using anonymous js functions in map reduce
queries.

9) benblack and PorterTech had a brief chat about crash recovery with Bitcask.

10) Q --- Does innostore work with multi\\_backend? (from joseph\\_sh via #riak)

 A --- It should. If it's not working for you, hit the mailing
list with any relevant info.
