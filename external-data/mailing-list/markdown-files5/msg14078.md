Riak Users,

There have been several issues people have ran into with Riak 2.0 pre's and
beta tags due to incompatibilities in different versions of Erlang. For
2.0 we are building against R16B02, with our own patches put on top of it.
 We are planning on documenting this on the docs page, but that page is not
updated yet.

So, if you'd like to build 2.0 from source, here is the Erlang you should
build from:

http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/erlang/otp\\_src\\_R16B02-basho4.tar.gz

If you'd like to see our patches, you can see what's changed here:

Thanks,
Jared
