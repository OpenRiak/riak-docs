Hi all,

 I was setting up Riak server on a server and it doesn't have more than 5k
instances of data too. I have a very basic 2-Node cluster setup. But, some
times when i check my cpu usage on server it is going for more than &gt;200%
and the node is getting terminated because of that. What might be the
issues for causing this kind of problems? When I don't have any data on my
riak node then it was working perfectly fine.

Any insights are much appreciated.

Regards,
Vamsi
