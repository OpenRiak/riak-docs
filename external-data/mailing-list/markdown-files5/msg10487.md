Awesome news! 

Is someone already working on a Homebrew Formula for it? (don't want to 
duplicate efforts if they are...)

Thanks!

&gt; Hi All -
&gt; 
&gt; Grab a coffee and hang onto your buffers. There is a lot of awesome
&gt; stuff to cover here.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Riak CS Now Open Source
&gt; 
&gt; It is with great pride, pleasure, and excitement that we announce Riak
&gt; CS (Cloud Storage) is now open source under the Apache 2 license!
&gt; 
&gt; For those of you not familiar with Riak CS, here's the tl;dr (from our docs):
&gt; 
&gt; Riak CS is multi-tenant cloud storage software for public and private
&gt; clouds. Built on Basho's distributed database Riak, Riak CS is
&gt; designed to provide simple, available, distributed cloud storage at
&gt; any scale. Riak CS is S3-API compatible and supports per-tenant
&gt; reporting for billing and metering use cases.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to take it for a test drive:
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Complete Riak CS Documentation: http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/
&gt; \\* Downloads: http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/riakcs-downloads/
&gt; \\* Riak CS Fast Track:
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/riakcs-tutorials/fast-track/
&gt; \\* Riak CS Source on GitHub: https://github.com/basho/riak\\_cs
&gt; 
&gt; For more information on what Riak CS is and why you should use and
&gt; contribute to it:
&gt; 
&gt; \\* Detailed blog post on the Riak CS release:

&gt; \\* Riak CS on basho.com: http://basho.com/riak-cloud-storage/
&gt; \\* RICON EAST this May in New York City will have various Riak CS
&gt; content and talks. Join us: ricon.io/east.html
&gt; \\* The HackerNews thread is sure to be quite lively, too :)

&gt; 
&gt; Wired [1], TechCrunch [2], and GigaOm [3] also did pieces on the release.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Riak CS 1.3 Is Now official
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to the code being open source, we're also releasing the
&gt; 1.3 version of Riak CS.
&gt; 
&gt; This release is full of great features and numerous bug fixes. The
&gt; full Riak CS 1.3 release notes are here:
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/Riak-CS-Release-Notes/
&gt; 
&gt; ## Community Support - Mailing List and IRC
&gt; 
&gt; We're planning to use the existing Riak users mailing list for Riak CS
&gt; users. Most of the issues and deployment questions about CS will have
&gt; some sort of Riak component to them, so it doesn't make sense to split
&gt; the discussions and support channels in two at the moment. That said,
&gt; if the CS-specific traffic proves to heavy, we'll revisit the idea of
&gt; spinning up a new list for CS.
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, the #riak room on freenode will serve as the IRC support 
&gt; channel.
&gt; 
&gt; ## What Now?
&gt; 
&gt; If you've never been excited about S3-Compatible cloud storage, the
&gt; time is now. :) All of us here at Basho are thrilled about expanding
&gt; the Riak Community with those of you who need flexible, scalable, open
&gt; source cloud storage. We're looking forward to you using and
&gt; contributing to Riak CS.
&gt; 
&gt; Let us know if you have any questions. And thanks for being a great community.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark (on behalf of Basho)
