I guess those splashes were caused by AAE, because eventually it became
normal:

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Can someone please explain the strange behaviour I'm experiencing with
&gt; node\\_gets stats vs vnode\\_gets on this histograms (screenshot):
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; https://www.dropbox.com/s/yrd7wg5q4ipfvk0/Screenshot%202014-12-06%2014.16.13.png?dl=0
&gt;
&gt; According to:
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/nodes/inspecting/
&gt;
&gt; node\\_gets - Number of GETs coordinated by this node, including GETs to
&gt; non-local vnodes in the last minute
&gt;
&gt; vnode\\_gets - Number of GET operations coordinated by local vnodes on this
&gt; node in the last minute
&gt;
&gt; My questions which I don't understand:
&gt;
&gt; 1. How can vnode\\_gets be larger than node\\_gets by 50x on a 5 node cluster?
&gt; If I understand the doc correctly, it can't be larger than sum of node\\_gets
&gt; on all nodes?
&gt;
&gt; 2. I can't explain those periodic splashes in vnode\\_gets each hour. There
&gt; are no such splashes on node\\_gets at the same periods and there is no
&gt; periodic load caused by my application. What can be the reason? AAE?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
