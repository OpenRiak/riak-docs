Bitcask keeps all the \\*keys\\* in RAM. That's like an index in database terms.
So even if you have 9Gb of data, you should only have a tiny fraction of
that in keys, in memory.

So you might have some other problem going on there?

Riak uses quite a bit of memory for LevelDB buffers, by default, so maybe
you're seeing something like that?

&gt; HI,

&gt; Iâ€™ve got a problem in using Riak-CS as file storage cluster.
&gt;
&gt; Now the bitcask folder has 9GB of data in it, and the RAM usage of Riak is
&gt; &gt;8GB.
&gt;
&gt; Just checked that the bitcask backend will put all the keys into the RAM,
&gt; but how come now I would get this large amount of RAM being used?
