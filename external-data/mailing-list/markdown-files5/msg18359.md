&gt; So At minimum I read that as there would need to be a new product name, and 
&gt; the docs for that product could say formerly known as Riak.

You are lawyer?

&gt; &gt; Looks like Basho has the trademark on Riak.

&gt; 
&gt; They sure do. And if you look at the Apache2 license you’ll see that it 
&gt; grants use of the name to identify the source.
&gt; 
&gt; Look, I’m not a lawyer, and I’m guessing you’re not a lawyer. What difference 
&gt; does the name or trademark make? There are a bunch of active users of Riak, 
&gt; some of whom have made it clear they plan to continue using it. Dance on 
&gt; Basho’s grave all you want, but Riak isn’t dead yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean “encumbered”? Riak is the name of an Apache2 licensed 
&gt; &gt; &gt; open source database, so it can continue to be used to describe that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; apache 2 licensed database, please don’t spread FUD.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You willing to invest time in a project that could be legally encumbered at 
&gt; &gt; some point in the future because lawyers? You willing to put that beyond 
&gt; &gt; the clown fiesta that is Basho? I don't think so.
