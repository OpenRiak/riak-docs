Hi Fred -

Did you try out "curl" to delete an object, rather than using the
python library?

Also - are you using Riak search? I'm trying to figure out some of the
errors I see in the logs. If you're on Riak 1.4 or later, could you
run "riak-debug" on each of your nodes and send me the archives that
are produced?

&gt; Hey Luke,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks so much for the reply. I have had a few people here looking at this
&gt; and have never seen anything like it. When I run the delete script, it
&gt; does fine for a while, then seems to crap out on an entry for whatever
&gt; reason. However, the errors you will see in these logs seem to happen even
&gt; during successful delete calls.
&gt;
&gt; I look forward to your feedback,
&gt;
&gt; Fred

&gt;&gt;Hi Fred,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Could you try deleting an object using an HTTP client app like "curl"?
&gt;&gt;Instructions for doing so are located here:
&gt;&gt;http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/basics/
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If that is not successful could you attach an archive of all of the
&gt;&gt;console.log\\* files from each node in your cluster? They should be
&gt;&gt;located in /var/log/riak.
&gt;&gt;
