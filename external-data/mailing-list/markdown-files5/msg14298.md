Hi,
Just looking for a bit of guidance on good practice when using Riak
via the PBC interface.

To keep request latency low, it's good to keep the connection open
between requests, rather than making a new connection for just a few
requests and then dropping it again, right?

In the JVM client, pools of connections are shared between large
numbers of threads. However it's harder to do that in Perl, which some
of our codebase is written in.
It'd be a lot easier to have one connection per process, but that's
potentially quite a lot of connections, albeit ones that are idle most
of the time.

I'd like to get a feeling for how expensive is it for the Erlang VM to
hold those connections open. Does it consume a lot of resources or is
it negligible?

Thanks,
Toby
