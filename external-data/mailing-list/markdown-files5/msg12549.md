Riak Users,

The 0.10.0 release of Yokozuna is ready.

This release brings a few features such as an upgrade in Solr version along
with some basic indexing and query stats. The default index has been
removed returning write performance closer to baseline for non-indexed
buckets. Disk usage was decreased by removing the default index and the
unused timestamp from the entropy data. Among the list of other fixes a
notable one is the improvement of Solr start-up and crash semantics. If
Solr crashes too frequently then Yokozuna will stop the local Riak node.

For installation instructions see the INSTALL doc.
