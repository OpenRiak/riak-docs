Hello,

I have a four node cluster running Riak 2.0.4 with n\\_val = 2 and
Search turned on. I removed (riak-admin cluster leave) one node. The
operation took a long time, but eventually completed. However, I could
see the java process consuming fair amount of CPU time during the
operation.

This leads me to a question: does Riak Search reindex transferred
objects during a handoff?

Thanks,
Miro
