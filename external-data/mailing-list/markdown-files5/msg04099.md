Evening, Morning, Afternoon to All -

This Recap is coming to you live from about 25,000 feet above Northern
California courtesy of Alaska Air's Wifi. (15000ms ping times and 18%
packet loss can't stop the Recap.)

Tons of good stuff to share today: new Ruby code, slide decks, blog
posts, and more.

Enjoy.

Riak Recap for July 25 - 26
====================

1) Sean Cribbs and the Ripple Team just released version 0.9.7 of the
riak-client and riak-sessions gems.

2) This made the List already but it's worth sending them along again:
Rusty's slides from the Secondary Indices talk he delivered at OSCON
on Monday are now available.

3) Denish Patel (@DenishPatel), with the help of Brian Clapper
(@neophenix), wrote a great blog post about how easy it is to
configure and use Circonus to monitor your Riak cluster.

Thanks, Denish and Brian!

4) Google wrote a quick blog post about their recently-released k/v
storage engine LevelDB. Diligent followers of Riak will recall that we
recently added support for LevelDB to Riak. This post has some
extensive benchmarks and also gives a shout out to...Riak :)
