Toby,

It seems to me like it would be nice if Riak "just worked" when you
&gt; installed it, instead of requiring each and every user to have to track
&gt; something down in the docs and then configure it in their chef/puppet
&gt; manifests. Don't you agree that is a desirable feature of good software?
&gt; (ie. Sensible defaults)
&gt;

That's a good point, and like I said above, I was willing to accept that I
was the only one with those views.

I filed an issue for my backlog
https://github.com/basho/node\\_package/issues/55 to take a look at that. It
is probably too late for our next major release to get in, but I do indeed
want to make this easier on everyone, so thanks for the feedback.

-Jared

&gt;&gt; I've considered packaging separate files for configuring the limit

&gt;&gt; the sysadmin should have a say in. I rather dislike packages that
&gt;&gt; make system changes without my knowledge or consent. Maybe that is
&gt;&gt; just me?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It's not making a system change though -- it's only adjusting things for
&gt; the riak/riakcs user.
&gt;
&gt; Can you think of any situation where a user would WANT to stick to the
&gt; default 1024 file-handle limit and yet be running Riak?
&gt;
&gt; Now think of how often that situation occurs, compared to the number of
&gt; times where the user DOES want the "good" number setup, and would just like
&gt; to install Riak and then get on with their work?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well the riak-cs / riak / stanchion scripts all drop privileges
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using sudo. On RHEL/Centos this sudo exec carries the settings
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from the calling user (in the case of init.d, root) so things
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are fine there. On Ubuntu/Debian that does not always work.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So if you set the ulimit for the root user, it might not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; propagate through to the riak-cs / riak / stanchion users.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So to change that, you should try to change it in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /etc/security/limits.conf.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My understanding is that only sessions opened through PAM will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be effected by the limits.d/\\* config files. ie. Not daemon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; processes. (I've checked this anyway with the following
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; /etc/security/limits.d/riakcs.\\*\\*conf: riak-cs hard nofile
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 32002 riak-cs soft nofile 32001 )
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As noted previously, this problem was not occurring on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; current Ubuntu LTS nodes; just the Debian Squeeze ones. Which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; makes it particularly odd.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for your help so far; I'll continue to investigate and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; report back if I find a solution.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I realised that the Riak CS user was called "riakcs" and not
&gt;&gt;&gt; "riak-cs". Once I changed that in the limits.d/riakcs.conf file,
&gt;&gt;&gt; riakcs started working without the file warning.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I also added in a line for the regular "riak" user while I was
&gt;&gt;&gt; there.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; May I suggest you add this to the debian/ubuntu packages by
&gt;&gt;&gt; default? (ie. a file in /etc/security/limits.d/ )
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers, Toby
