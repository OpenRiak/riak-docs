Dear Brian, 

 I'm currently using a different class loader though a dynamic 
language(Jython), so for now, I'm not able to run the sample shown on the 
page you refrence below. I would be great to have a similar Java client 
sample code like the one shown in the Python client module 
[ http://basho.github.com/riak-python-client/tutorial.html ] with the 
entire source code showing its classes used and its imports.Basically what 
I want to do is to query a set of JSON like data objects with different 
criteria. 

The basic client access tests using Java and Python clients was 
successful. 

Having a cookbook would be great for demonstrating the benefits of the 
NoSql technology, also combined with the features of Map and Reduce. 

Regards, 
Claude

Subject: Re: Java Riak Client / MapReduce Querying, Any Sample 
Code?



Cluade,

The example code in the readme on github does have some basic examples of 
using MR in the Java client: https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client - 
scroll down to about 3/4 of the way to the end. 

I'm also currently working on a more comprehensive Java client "cookbook" 
and MR is probably the next item I'll be adding. 

Is there a particular thing you're trying to do that you need help with?

Thanks,
Brian Roach

Dear colleagues, 

Is there any basic sample or documentation available that illustrate how 
to construct execute the MapReduce syntax through the Riak Java Interface. 


Thanks in advance for your feedback.
