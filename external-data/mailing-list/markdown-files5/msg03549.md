Riak Recap for June 1 - 2
===================

1) The Homebrew recipes for Riak and Riak Search have both been

2) The awesome Berlin Buzzwords Conference starts June 6th in Berlin.
For those of you attending, you can look forward to Basho
representation in the form of Mathias Meyer (@roidrage) and Sean
Cribbs (@seancribbs). Mathias will be giving at talk called "NOSQL:
PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE", and Sean's talked is "WRAP YOUR SQL HEAD
AROUND RIAK & MAPREDUCE".

\\* Talk details here ---&gt; http://berlinbuzzwords.de/calendar/2011-06-06

3) For any Ripple Users out there: Sean et al are about to change the
escaping behavior to URI-style by default. If you've got opinions on
this, now is the time to make them known.

\\* Details here ---&gt; http://twitter.com/#!/seancribbs/status/76746950430560256

4) Basho Principal Architect Andy Gross (@argv0) was just added to a
panel discussion at the HotStorage Conference happening in Portland,
OR. The event starts on June 14th and the panel, called "Panel: Big
Data, No SQL, Big Problems, No Worries" is happening that morning at
8:50 AM.

Details here ---&gt; http://www.usenix.org/events/hotstorage11/tech/

(I'm planning to come up to Portland for this, so if anyone is in town
and wants to grab a drink, let me know. We're also considering
throwing a mini-drinkup of sorts and will announce in a few days at
the latest if it's going to happen...)

5) Dan Dean made it known on Twitter that he's tinkering with a
riakjs-based model implementation.
