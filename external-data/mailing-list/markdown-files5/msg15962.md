hi,
For the organization that I am working for, it seems like 25tb of storage
is needed. Reading riak docs, it's mentioned that at least 5 servers should
be put in place.

what is the harm in having only 2 riak nodes? will this reduce performance?
or cause loss of data? Since Riak is masterless, either one of the server
will have the data at any point of time.

Thanks for your time
Shankar
