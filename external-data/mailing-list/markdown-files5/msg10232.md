Thanks, Russell.

In that case I have one more argument to upgrade to 1.3.0 :) I'll try to 
confirm that we are hitting this issue and see if we can fix it by applying the 
proper patch.

&gt;&gt; Can you confirm that the PR didn't made it into 1.3.0? It was closed about 
&gt;&gt; two four weeks ago...
&gt; 
&gt; It is not in 1.3. We actually had the code freeze for 1.3.0 a \\_long\\_ time ago 
&gt; (I think it was 16th Nov 2012) and this fix did not make it in time for the 
&gt; freeze.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry,

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think I'm hitting the same issue here. In one project I'm using last write 
&gt;&gt; wins and the read repair count is ridiculously high. I'm hoping that this 
&gt;&gt; might also help reducing the latency problem we are seeing for the 99th+ 
&gt;&gt; percentiles of requests.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is fixed in master, but it doesn't look like it made it into 1.3.0. If 
&gt;&gt;&gt; you're ok with building from source, I tried it and a patch from 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8895d2877576af2441bee755028df1a6cf2174c7 goes cleanly onto 1.3.0.
