Thanks for the quick response,

Now it is working, maybe to be added to a wish list, a flag to 
"enforce\\_secure\\_transport" and by default be true, I'm quite sure many 
users use SSH tunnels for those things, no point on loading certificates 
and stuff if your servers are well protected and there is a different 
transport for sensitive information.


Regards,

Guido.

Hi,

Is it possible to have Riak control running at HTTP port on localhost?
Assuming security is provided by SSH tunnels.
If so what is needed to be done at app.config? I enabled Riak control
but it is redirecting me to HTTPS.

Yes, this is possible if you disable the authentication.

It will only redirect to SSL when the authentication is set to 'user list'
instead of 'none' to ensure you don't expose credentials over an
unencrypted channel.
