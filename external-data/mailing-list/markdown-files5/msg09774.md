Today, the Microsoft Open Tech team announced the launch of the Azure
VM Depot[0]. A post detailing the purpose, an overview of their
plans, etc can be found on the interoperability@microsoft blog[1].

Riak 1.2.1 was one of the images included in this launch[2]. For
those of you so inclined, this should make your deployent of Riak on
Azure quite a bit simpler. That Basho blog post on the subject is in
the usual location[3].

Being the nice fellow that he his, Mark Phillips has made a generous
swag offer for those willing to test and report their results.

Cheers,
