Sept 16 is software freedom day, a release that day might be a nice idea.

&gt; Given that all of the code except for MDC (and maybe JMX) is under
&gt; Apache 2, I would assume that those components would follow the
&gt; already existing license of the other components.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a plan to change the original license on the open source
&gt; product from Apache 2?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A quick status update. Today bet365 have signed the agreement to purchase 
&gt;&gt; all Basho IP. We expect the agreement to be ratified in the US courts next 
&gt;&gt; week. Once cleared, our intention is to open source all code, help rebuild 
&gt;&gt; the community and collaboratively take the development of RIAK forward.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In the coming weeks we will hopefully answer the questions people have and 
&gt;&gt; will be calling on the community to help forge the initial RIAK Roadmap.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; One of the initial questions we have for the community is which OSS license 
&gt;&gt; would people like applied to the code? Our thought is the most open and 
&gt;&gt; permissive.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Andy.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; I have been wanting to make you aware for a few weeks now that we have 
&gt;&gt; reached an agreement, in principle, to buy all of Basho's remaining assets 
&gt;&gt; (except support contracts) from the receiver. Up until this afternoon, I was 
&gt;&gt; constrained by some confidentiality needs of the receiver and was unable to 
&gt;&gt; speak.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We have agreed a price for the assets and are almost at the end of 
&gt;&gt; sorting out the legal agreement. Once this is complete, this will then need 
&gt;&gt; to be processed through the courts which, I am advised, should take a week 
&gt;&gt; or so.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is our intention to open source all of Basho's products and all of 
&gt;&gt; the source code that they have been working on. We'll do this as quickly as 
&gt;&gt; we are able to organise it, and we would appreciate some input from the 
&gt;&gt; community on how you would like this done.
