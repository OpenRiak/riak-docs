Hi Harald,

While I can't speak to the timeline for fixing this in current Riak
Search, I can say that this won't be an issue in Yokozuna [1]. Solr's
sort operation works quite well, and when the beautiful marriage of
Riak and Solr is complete (it's well on its way), you'll be able to
sort quite nicely.

I know this doesn't fix your issue with current Riak Search, but I
thought it was worth mentioning. At some point before Yokozuna is
officially supported there will be an upgrade path [2] but this is
still under heavy-development.

Hope that helps. Thanks for your patience.

Mark

&gt; i would like to ask if there is any timeline when this bug in "riak\\_search"
&gt; gets fixed, see pull requests:
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\\_search/pull/136
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\\_search/pull/137
&gt;
&gt; for me it's no problem to apply the patches during installation of riak,
&gt; still it would be nice to have it in a future riak release ... :).
&gt;
&gt; thanks!
