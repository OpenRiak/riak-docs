&gt; In Riak, there is no single primary copy considered the canonical version.
&gt; For each key, there will be N (3 by default) partitions responsible for
&gt; storing the associated value. In effect, there are N primaries for any key.
&gt; This is how Riak makes its availability guarantees, as well as why "absolute
&gt; consistency" is difficult.

But who makes the decision that a partition needs to migrate and where
a key is at any time during that migration? That isn't independently
decided by each node, is it? And if you have an authority for that,
why can't a client ask that authority to control ordering of
operations for certain things where the client is willing to trade the
time it might take for atomicity.
