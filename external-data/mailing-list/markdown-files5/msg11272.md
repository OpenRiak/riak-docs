Hey,

I'm trying to get Riak to load through the erl\\_boot\\_server, have anyone
had any success with this before?

At the moment i'm stuck with the most basic part of just getting
dependencies to load over the server. The boot file is loaded (judging
by the fact it tries to load deps) but no code is found.

I start the bootserver with:
erl -id bootserver -name bootserver -pa lib/\\*/ebin -run erl\\_boot\\_server
start 127.0.0.1

The riak vm
erl -id riak -name riak -hosts 127.0.0.1 -loader inet -boot
releases/riak-1.3.1/riak

So the first issue arises: {"init terminating in do\\_boot",{'cannot
load',error\\_handler,get\\_file}}

This can be mitigated by adding kernel & stdlib to the codepath with -pa

Now when i run it it returns a error stating it can't find mochiweb:
{bad\\_return,
 {{mochiweb\\_app,start,[normal,[]]},
 {'EXIT',
 {undef,
 [{mochiweb\\_app,start,[normal,[]],[]},
 {application\\_master,start\\_it\\_old,4,
 [{file,"application\\_master.erl"},
 {line,274}]}]}}}}

As far as i understand it uses erl\\_prim\\_loader which in turn requests
code remotely from the boot server. Now since the boot script defines
where to find the code on disk i assume that it just needs to be corrected
to point to the right place - i base this on `erl\\_prim\\_loader:get\\_file/1`
works when given a path relative to the bootserver working dir.

Any pointers on how todo this is greatly appreciated

Olav
