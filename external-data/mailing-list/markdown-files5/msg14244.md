Ingo, 

Sorry for the lack of response. What version of Riak are you using? At this 
point, i assumee riak-admin aae\\_status shows alls trees as built across the 
cluster. How much space is the AAE directory currently using?

Thanks,
Brian

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; we had a little outage of our 12 node riak cluster yesterday, the first
&gt; &gt; so far, four nodes had gone down because of exhausted disk space.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What happened: our backup crashed, leaving one node down. Because of a
&gt; &gt; misconfiguration in our monitoring, this node stayed down for 9 days. It
&gt; &gt; was then started and recovered after about 7 hours of running.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But then the disk space usage on six of our nodes start to explode until
&gt; &gt; the disks were full on four of them. This seems to have been caused by
&gt; &gt; AAE. We have about 320GB of real user data stored in levelDB and
&gt; &gt; yesterday night AAE consumed about 150GB on each of this nodes. Is this
&gt; &gt; normal or what should I expect?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I deleted the "anti\\_entropy" on these six nodes and started the nodes
&gt; &gt; again, running fine since then. AAE gets rebuild but at a lot of lower
&gt; &gt; level so far. I would be happy if someone could shed a light on this, I
&gt; &gt; didn't find anything helpful in the logs or the docs on docs.basho.com 
&gt; &gt; (http://docs.basho.com)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Best,
&gt; &gt;
