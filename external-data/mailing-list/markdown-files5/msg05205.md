&gt; I had a chat with Reid Draper about it (he is much more pythonic than me),
he concurs. I just need to do a bit more reading through the code, and
unless anyone here objects (anyone? class? anyone?), I'll start work at
merging your fork into the Basho repo so we can get back on track.

I hope it is no work; I think that it is close to basho/master, and can
merge clean. I can't check for a while, as I'm on planes for the next 22
hours :-(

After you merge, I'll start three branches: one for doc/test fixes, another
for deprecating bogus transports, and one to work with Brett on timeouts.
I'd like his input on that part, as we both want timeout handling for our
production systems.

Thanks!
