Hi,

Just an update on the progress of riak-2.2.5 release. I realize we said
"end of 2017" and then "end of Jan" and then "end of Feb" and here we
are, 1st March, spring is upon us, and still no 2.2.5. I thought it best
to at least keep you posted.

Why no release? Well, we're not quite finished yet. In terms of what is
left:

- a few PRs need review and merge against the upstream Basho repo (see
[1] if you want to help there);
- Opening of PRs for gsets;
- Docs for the changes;
- Release notes;
- Tagging;
- A final round of testing (and fixing?) after all is merged;
- Client support. This is crucial, but all the above work only has
client support in the Basho erlang clients. I'm hoping the community
that uses the Java/Python/Ruby etc clients can step up here. But we can release 
Riak before all client work is done.

The optimist in me says 2 weeks.

What do I mean "release"?

&gt;From my point of view the release is the tags. After that I'm sincerely
hoping ESL will continue to kindly build and host the actual artifacts.

What's in the release?

As a reminder, since it's been a while since StokeCon17, this release
contains:

- Some developer clean-up around `make test` and `riak\\_test` to make
them more reliable/trustworthy;
- Open source MDC Repl (thanks bet365!);
- A fix for a bug in riak core claim that led to unbalanced rings[2];
- `node\\_confirms` a feature like `w` or `pw` but for physical diversity in 
durability[3];
- `participate in coverage` an admin setting that takes a node out of
the coverage plan (for example after adding a node while transfers
take place);
- Riak repl fix, and change to unsafe default behaviour[4];
- Addition of a GSet to riak data types;
- Fix to repl stats[5].

Sorry if I missed anything. The release notes will have it all.

Work is already begun on Riak 3.0 with OTP20 support well under way.
Some candidates for inclusion that we're working on are a new
pure-Erlang backend[6], and a radical overhaul of AAE for both intra and 
inter-cluster anti-entropy.

Sorry for the delay, thanks for your patience. Weâ€™ll keep you posted.

Cheers

Russell
