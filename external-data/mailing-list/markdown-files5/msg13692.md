Hey Gang,

I'm pretty excited about the new CRDT support coming in the next release. 
Although counters are already out, I haven't seen much in the way of 
performance guidelines. Where counters are a fold/merge/sum type of deal with 
some kind of reasonably bounded size based on update frequency, sets and maps 
are potentially unbounded. Is there any guidance Basho can share in regards to 
at which size performance will drop off for set/maps. Every feature has some 
theoretical vs practical limit, ie. links, wondering what those are for the new 
set/map features. Obviously, ymmv. 

Thanks,

-Alexander Sicular
