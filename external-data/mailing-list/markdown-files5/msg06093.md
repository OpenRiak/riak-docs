Hi all

My illustrious employer has tasked me with evaluating riak as a 
replacement for our inhouse K, V store.


As part of this evaluation I need to performance test riak, looking 
around I see that basho\\_bench appears to be quite a well laid out tool 
that should save me a lot of effort in terms of creating test plans with 
a traditional tool like jmeter.


However we would like to test with our real dataset rather than with 
random data.


As such I have written an erlang module that allows me to expose our 
seed data set as a tuple of {ID, Binary}.


I want to integrate this into basho\\_bench in the custom value\\_generator 
and key\\_generator functions, however the documentation is a little 
sparse and I am struggling to work out what I am expected to return for 
my function in both cases.


Does anyone have any pointers, or better yet, examples of such things.

Many thanks

-- Greg
