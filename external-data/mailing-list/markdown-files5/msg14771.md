I don't think I've mentioned this on this list before, because it was
mostly an experiment, and has never seen production use anywhere, but
on the off chance it helps you dig out of trouble by upgrading Riakâ€¦

Some time ago I forked luwak to create a version of it that could be
run as an app outside of a Riak node:

https://github.com/beerriot/luwak/tree/external

This external app will read content written by the built-in luwak, but
the built-in luwak can't read data written by this external app.

The big change that fork involved was using regular 'get' operations
to read chunks, instead of mapreduce. The tradeoff is more network
traffic, but in exchange you get read repair and other dynamo
niceties.

Heed the warnings in the readme.
This hasn't been tested in ages.
Consider migrating to RiakCS instead.
YMMVHTHHAND,
Bryan
