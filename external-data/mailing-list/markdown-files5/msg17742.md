Hi,
we are testing Riak TS for our Application right now. I have a couple of 
question how to query the data. We are measuring electric power which comes in 
in odd time intervals.

1. Is it possible to query the value which has been received bevor at a given 
time? In other words: Get the current / last value of a series.

2. Is it possible to query the average in respect to time?
For instance you have such a measurement reading:

time | value
-----------------
09:31 | 4
10:02 | 6
10:05 | 3

And you want to query the average from 10:00 to 10:10. I would expect a value 
of 4.1
4 \\* 20% + 6 \\* 30% + 3 \\* 50% = 4.1

3. Is it possible to query 15 minutes average values for the last day? I would 
expect 96 values with the average as described in question 2.

Thanks a lot.
Jan Paulus
