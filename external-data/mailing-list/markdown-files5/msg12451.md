Hi folks

We're looking for a (preferably independent) expert who can advise our IT group 
about Riak and how to setup and configure a smallish cluster, as well as sanity 
check what we are planning to do with it.

If you are interested please email me directly.

We're based in Melbourne Australia, so if you're local that would be an 
advantage.

Thanks.
