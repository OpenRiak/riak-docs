Riak Recap for 5/7-5/9

1) @garrydanger spent some time hacking on socket based communication
from to Riak from .net

You can check it out here -- &gt; http://github.com/garethstokes/Data.RiakClient

I've also added a pointer to it It's also been added to the Community
Projects page:

http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Community-Developed+Libraries+and+Projects

2) More goodness from the node.js world: @technoweenie released Ripple
inspired HTTP lib for node.js. It WAS called "Rhodes" but turns out
that name was already taken, so watch the blog post for new repo name
and location.

Blog post here -- &gt; http://techno-weenie.net/2010/5/10/rhodes-riak-on-node-js

Once that gets straightened out, it'll be added to the Riak Wiki.

3) Bitcask got a huge enhancement over the weekend. There is now
support for time-based expiration of data. Most obvious use case for
this would be a session store, but there are many, many more.

Check out the changes at Bitbucket -
http://bitbucket.org/basho/bitcask or GitHub -

4) Sean Cribbs gave a Riak Training Class at Red Dirt Ruby on Friday.
You can get at his slides here:

http://www.slideshare.net/seancribbs/introduction-to-riak-red-dirt-ruby-conf-training

5) Rusty Klophaus (@rklophaus) has been added to the impressive set of
speakers at Berlin Buzzwords next month. You can get more info on his
talks and the conference here:

http://berlinbuzzwords.de/content/rusty-klophaus

5a) @old\\_sound and @roidrage made plans to meetup and see Bad Religion
in Berlin during the Buzzwords conference. This is almost as important
as Buzzwords itself. In fact, you should probably make this a
priority. (via IRC)

\\*\\*\\* Anyone who gets a picture of themselves at this show holding a
Basho/Riak logo will get a fresh Riak T. Anyone who gets a pic of a
Bad Religion band member holding a Basho/Riak logo will get something
so cool it can't even be mentioned here.

6) For anyone in NYC - On Thursday, May 20th, @justinsheehy will be
taking part in a "Future of Databases" discussion. We worked with
@lessin and the awesome team at Drop.io to set this up, and it should
be a great event. In addition to Justin, I'll be in the crowd, so let
me know if you'll be there and we can chat.
