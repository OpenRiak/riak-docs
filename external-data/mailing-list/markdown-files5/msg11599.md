I have installed Erlang and R statistics Language (R 3.0.1 executables) on my
Windows PC desktop, and also I have installed and compiled Basho bench on
Windows PC. 

I am able to run the basho bench benchmark tests on Windows PC against the
Riak server on Linux platform. And then I am trying to generate benchmark
tests using R from Basho bench via the command: make results (or the manual
command like: priv/summary.r -i tests/current), but I see the following
error:

$ make results
priv/summary.r -i tests/current
file name is missing
priv/summary.r: line 6: syntax error near unexpected token `('
priv/summary.r: line 6: `arg0 &lt;- sub("--file=(.\\*)", "\\\\1", grep("--file=",
commandArgs(), value = TRUE))'
Makefile:19: recipe for target `results' failed
make: \\*\\*\\* [results] Error 2

If I commented out the arg0 and dir0 lines, and I see the following error as
well:

$ make results
priv/summary.r -i tests/current
file name is missing
priv/summary.r: line 11: syntax error near unexpected token `('
priv/summary.r: line 11: `params = matrix(c('
Makefile:19: recipe for target `results' failed
make: \\*\\*\\* [results] Error 2

What could be the reasons for these issues ? such as:
(1) Because basho bench is running on Windows PC, so do we need to modify
the summary.r file to correct the above errors (by the way, I made one line
change for the location of Rscript on my Windows PC) ?
(2) Does the R installation have any issues, such as missing packages ?

Thanks for your inputs in advance if you got some ideas.

Here are some details about the installations of each component:
(1) Erlang Installation:
 http://www.erlang.org/download\\_release/14
 R15B01 Windows Binary File: otp\\_win32\\_R15B01.exe
(2) R Installation:
 http://cran.rstudio.com/
 R-3.0.1-win.exe
(3) Basho Bench Installation:
 http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Benchmarking/
 git clone git://github.com/basho/basho\\_bench.git
 cd basho\\_bench
 make
(4) Run Basho Bench tests using Cygwin:
 ./basho\\_bench myconfig.config
