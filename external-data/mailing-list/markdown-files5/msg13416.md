&gt; I guess you must be right. Riakâ€™s vnode version vectors, in the case
&gt; described in 3.2 would generate siblings. The put of `v` with an empty VV
&gt; would lead to the value `v` and VV {b, 1}, but the put of `w` with no VV
&gt; would not lead to a VV of {b, 2} and overwriting of {b, 1}=`v`.
&gt;
&gt; What Riak does is this: look at the incoming VV, and increment it (so {b,
&gt; 1}=`w` for that second client put) read the state on disk ({b, 1}=`v`)
&gt; realise that these values are concurrent (the incoming value does not
&gt; dominate the local value), so keep them both, and generate a VV that
&gt; dominates ({b, 2}=`v`, `w`).
&gt;
&gt; Does that answer your question?
&gt;

It sure does. Thanks Russell.
