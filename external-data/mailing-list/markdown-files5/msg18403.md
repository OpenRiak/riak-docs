Hi All,

I just wanted to share some news about Riak and commercial support 
options - as you may be aware Basho has been placed into liquidation at 
the end of July and the assets are being disposed of.


We are pleased to announce Erlang Solutions has partnered with TI Tokyo 
to provide continuity of enterprise grade support to users of the Riak 
suite of products.


It means that Riak users now have an alternative to Basho commercial 
support. We are offering 24/7 enterprise-grade support together with 
expert Riak and Erlang consulting services.


We have now launched support and I will be happy to discuss your 
support requirements.


There is still some uncertainty around the ownership of the Riak IPR 
(Bashoâ€™s receivers are in the process of trying to dispose of its 
business and assets), Erlang Solutions and TI Tokyo intend to work with 
all of you and rest of the Riak user community to ensure the Riak 
product set evolves and flourishes and we welcome contact from all those 
who wish to become active contributors to ensure Riak has a future.


Feel free to contact me if you or your colleagues would like to find out 
more about our support or have any questions.


Regards,
Steve Roberts
