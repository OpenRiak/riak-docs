The Basho TE team is kicking off a new weekly forum an hour from now: the Riak 
Community Hangout[1].

Most[2] Fridays at 11am Pacific/2pm Eastern/7pm[3] GMT we'll be holding a 15-30 
minute, development-focused Google Hangout, with the video to be posted later 
on YouTube[4]. 

A primary focus for coming weeks will be the new features in Riak 2.0. Today 
we'll talk data types (CRDTs) and Riak Search (Yokozuna), with Mark Phillips 
leading the discussion, and Basho hackers Sean Cribbs, Brett Hazen, and Luke 
Bakken participating.

Future episodes will focus on Riak / Riak CS internals, application building 
(e.g., "How to build a session store on Riak"), and the Riak / Riak CS 
development process. We'll also be looking for brave souls from the community 
to participate and talk about what they are building. Let us know what topics 
you'd like to see covered.

Please feel free to tune in each week, and send questions via IRC[5] or 
Twitter[6].

[1] The Hangout URL will be published on this list and via Twitter (@basho)
