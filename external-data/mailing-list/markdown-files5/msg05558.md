Riak Recap for November 9 - 10
=======================

1) We merged a small contribution to the Erlang Protobuffs code from
Michel Rijnders.

\\* Commit here ---&gt;
https://github.com/basho/erlang\\_protobuffs/commit/9e662bd002b3e3ac3dbc1215b99890c321e8ceab

2) Rick Olson at GitHub wrote a short blog post about git.io, their
Riak-backed URL shortener.

\\* Read here ---&gt; https://github.com/blog/985-git-io-github-url-shortener
\\* Also, you can get to the Riak and Basho repos using git.io/riak and
git.io/basho, respectively.

3) Sean Cribbs posted the slides from the "Embracing NoSQL and
Eventual Consistency with Ripple" talk he gave at Ruby Conf Uruguay.

\\* These are well worth it ---&gt;

4) Jon Brisbin has been busy again. :)

\\* Updated the RabbitMQ/Riak custom exchange to the 2.7 Rabbit release
---&gt; http://twitter.com/#!/j\\_brisbin/statuses/134703020725387265
\\* Released a new repo called "rabbitmq-riak-code-vnode-dispatcher"
that should help you use vnodes with RabbitMQ.

5) We added the ability to check your config file via the Riak command
line tools. (This has been around for a while but I'm not sure we
advertised it well enough.)

\\* Details here ---&gt;

6) Jordan Schatz is working on a Racket API to Riak.

\\* Code here ---&gt; https://github.com/shofetim/Racket-Riak

7) Basho is hiring Developer Advocates.
