Gordon,
Could you try:

erlang:process\\_info(list\\_to\\_pid("&lt;0.16614.32&gt;"), [messages,
current\\_function, initial\\_call, links, memory, status]).

in a riak search console for one/some of those mailboxes and share the
results? I am curious to see if you are having the same systemic
memory consumption I am experiencing.

&gt; We are having a bit of an issue with our 3-node riaksearch cluster.  What is 
&gt; happing is this:
&gt;
&gt; Cluster is up and running.  We start testing our application against it.  As 
&gt; the application runs the erlang process consumes more and more memory without 
&gt; ever releasing it.
&gt;
&gt; In trying to investigate the issue we ran the riaksearch-admin cluster\\_info 
&gt; command.  It appears that the bulk of this memory is being consumed by a 
&gt; bunch of mailboxes.
&gt;
&gt; I have posted both the output of the cluster\\_info command and the app.config 
&gt; from one of the nodes here:
&gt;
&gt; https://gist.github.com/996419
&gt;
&gt; I would be very grateful if someone from Basho would take a look at the 
&gt; cluster\\_info and see if they can spot anything obvious.
&gt;
&gt; Each machine in the cluster has an 8-core Xeon and 16GB RAM.  I believe all 
&gt; of the platform details, etc., are in the cluster\\_info dump.
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks,
&gt;
