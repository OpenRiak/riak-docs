Due to disk space constraints I had to move to 5 node cluster anyway. I'm
uploading a compressed 6GB json file. I'm not sure the actual datasize, but
is should be about 10 ~ 12 times that (By the time I've reached 1.3mi docs,
the disk usage was around 23GB)

I restarted the test and now I'm with 2mi docs.

The upload speed is a constant 75 docs/s.

Query response doesn't look too good now, but then again I didn't do any
tuning. I wanted some numbers how it would perform out-of-the-box.

&gt; Hi Pablo,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your reply. I am looking forward to your results. Please also
&gt; add the data size details. We have customers that dealing with web scale
&gt; data size ( billion docs) so I am looking riaksearch whether it is fast
&gt; enough and feature ready to this job. We want all queries should be below
&gt; 900 ms ..
&gt;
&gt; I will also make other tests and will be publis in this wiki..
&gt;
&gt; Regards

&gt; I haven't used your data, but I'm trying to benchmark riak search against
&gt; solr.
&gt;
&gt; For my test, I'm using each paragraph in the english version of wikipedia
&gt; as a document as well as some sequential and random data in a couple of
&gt; fields to reflect our current usage (which is a CMS). That's about 22
&gt; million documents. My initial test is using just one machine to load it all,
&gt; but in the next couple of days, I'll be using a 5 node Dell R610 with 24GB
&gt; RAM and SSD drives to see how well it will perform against solr, which will
&gt; be using the same machines.
&gt;
&gt; Right now, I'm looking into stats information to plot graphs (we use
&gt; cacti). So far, I've been using a few numbers from /stats page (and trying
&gt; to figure out what they mean. lol).
&gt;
&gt; The only numbers I've got so far is that I was able to index about 1
&gt; million documents at a rate of 65 documents/s while the solr interface works
&gt; pretty fast and the load on the machine seems to be steady (around 2.5).
&gt;
&gt; I'd really like some real world input to build the graphs, and when I'm
&gt; done, I'm gonna post them on the wiki. :D
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Week ago I put data ready to index riaksearch via solr interface in the
&gt;&gt; rapidshare to make it available to community.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would love to get some benchmark resuts from you guys. Is there anybody
&gt;&gt; test it ?
