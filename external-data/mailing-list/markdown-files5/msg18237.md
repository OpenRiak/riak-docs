Hi,

This is just a quick reply since this is somewhat a current topic on the ML.

On 24 May 2017, at 12:57, Denis Gudtsov  wrote:

&gt; Hello
&gt; 
&gt; We have 6-nodes cluster with ring size 128 configured. The problem is that
&gt; two partitions has replicas only on two nodes rather than three as required
&gt; (n\\_val=3). We have tried several times to clean leveldb and ring directories
&gt; and then rebuild cluster, but this issue is still present. 

There was a fairly long discussion about this very issue recently (see 
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\\_lists.basho.com/2017-May/019281.html)

I ran a little code and the following {RingSize, NodeCount, IsViolated} tuples 
were the result. If you built any of these clusters from scratch (i.e. you 
started NodeCount nodes, and used riak-admin cluster join, riak-admin cluster 
plan, riak-admin cluster commit to create a cluster of NodeCount from scratch) 
then you have tail violations in your ring.

[{16,3,true},
 {16,5,true},
 {16,7,true},
 {16,13,true},
 {16,14,true},
 {32,3,true},
 {32,5,true},
 {32,6,true},
 {32,10,true},
 {64,3,true},
 {64,7,true},
 {64,9,true},
 {128,3,true},
 {128,5,true},
 {128,6,true},
 {128,7,true},
 {128,9,true},
 {128,14,true},
 {256,3,true},
 {256,5,true},
 {256,11,true},
 {512,3,true},
 {512,5,true},
 {512,6,true},
 {512,7,true},
 {512,10,true}]


&gt; How can we diagnose where the issue is and fix it?

WRT your problem, a quick experiment looks like adding 2 new nodes will solve 
your problem, just adding one doesn’t look like it does. I tried just adding 
one new node and still had a single violated preflist, but I have just thrown a 
little experiment together so I could well be wrong. It doesn’t actually build 
any clusters, and uses the claim code out of context, ymmv

&gt; Is there any way how we
&gt; can assign partition to node manually? 

I don’t know of a way, but that would be very useful.

Do you remember if this cluster was built all at once as a 6-node cluster, or 
has it grown over time? Have you run the command riak-admin diag ring\\_preflists 
as documented here 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/setup/upgrading/checklist/#confirming-configuration-with-riaknostic?

Sorry I can’t be more help

Cheers

Russell
