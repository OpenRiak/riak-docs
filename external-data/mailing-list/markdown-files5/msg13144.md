Evening, Morning, Afternoon to All -

All the RICON West Videos are now live. You can find them in this playlist:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKqgGpAOv1w&list=PL9Jh2HsAWHxKAIZ5n-PkPW3CHg2wI-MWb

We've got full-length talks covering most of the new features in Riak
2.0, use cases from The Weather Channel, State Farm, StackMob, and others,
and much more.

Also, if anyone is in/around Raleigh/Durham and is interested in meeting
up, ping me. I'll be out there in a few weeks.

Enjoy,
