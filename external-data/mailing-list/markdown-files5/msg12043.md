I am also interested in the answer to this. If I had to 
choose between having 2 dedicated servers, each with 32GB RAM, or 5 
virtual servers each with 2GB RAM (which just happens to be the case for
 us at the moment), my gut feel is go with the 2 dedicated servers. But 
Basho seems pretty fixed on having at least 5 nodes. Would a 2 node 
system be viable?Regards,-- Nico

4:32 PMHello,I need to 
decide what database we will choose for our project. Certainly, we need 
only 2 physical nodes (active-standby). Riak is good for us, becase it 
is Erlang-based, as our project. But is's known that riak cluster should
 have at least five nodes. I have some problems with my cluster, same as
 in this E-mail: 
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\\_lists.basho.com/2012-March/007988.htmlCould
 you cleraly explain, please, is it possible to tune riak to work 
correctly with only 2 physical nodes, or we need to choose another DBMS?Dmitry\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_riak-users
