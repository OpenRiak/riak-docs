 I get this error on a seemingly random basis, with a one-node cluster
accessed locally over the default HTTP port (via riak-js).

It was so persistent that I have been taking the (probably needed
anyway) step of adding retry logic to every single call, which seems to
have solved the issues for me at any rate.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm using riak-js and the error I get is:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; { [Error: socket hang up] code: 'ECONNRESET' }
&gt;&gt; That is a strange error -- are there any corresponding errors in
&gt;&gt; server logs? I would have expected a timeout or some such...
&gt;
&gt; That is a standard network error in nodejs that bubbles up the stack. Same 
&gt; sort of error you get in the redis nodejs library when you cant connect to 
&gt; redis. It's a connection thing. Riak-js library is set to connect to the 
&gt; default riak port on localhost. If that has changed or the service is down 
&gt; you'll get that sort of error.
