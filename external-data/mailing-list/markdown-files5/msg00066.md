Via the Erlang client, 'cause that's what I had handy, I did a put/get 
combination on an object with a key 5000 chars long. Worked with no issues. You 
might run into URL length issues, depending on the client libs used, and/or the 
HTTP interface might have issues with URLs that long but I think the 
underpinnings should work with long keys just fine. Obviously, you're creating 
additional overhead with large keys -- replicas and such -- but it should Just 
Work otherwise.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; What is or is there a maximum key length in Riak? Either natively or in the 
&gt; HTTP interface?
&gt; 
&gt; My use case is keeping inheritance in it's own key so for example, I have two 
&gt; keys, "A" and "B" and I want to keep a third key "A,B". You see that the key 
&gt; length is a function of member key size times number of members. Knowing 
&gt; length would give me an aproximation of depth.

&gt; Thank you,
