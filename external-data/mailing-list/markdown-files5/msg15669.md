Thanks Christopher,

BTW, A few more questions:
- If something goes wrong during the process of joining the nodes, is it
possible to make a rollback? If true, how?
- Should I look again to the leveldb configurations. It has been working
pretty smoothly for more than one year, but 6 more nodes suggests that some
tuning may be needed..

Best regards,
Edgar

&gt; &gt; It is expected that the total amount of data per node lowers quite a
&gt; lot, correct? I'm doubling the size of the cluster (6 more nodes).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I ask this because the actual 6 machines have 1.5Tb in disks, but the
&gt; new ones ( for now) have only 1Tb.
&gt;
&gt; Thatâ€™s correct; you should reduce per-node allocation by adding additional
&gt; nodes.
&gt;
&gt; However, to minimize the amount of data that needs to be relocated, you
&gt; should add all nodes together rather than one at a time. This prevents the
&gt; situation where some percentage of the data gets moved between nodes
&gt; multiple times.
