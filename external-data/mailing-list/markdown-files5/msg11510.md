Hi

I've been looking at links and link walking and I noticed that Riak very often 
returns a special type of link with rel="up" instead of a riaktag, which is 
illegal for users to create.

What is the purpose of this link? (beyond the reasonably obvious "this key 
belongs to bucket X). Why was it added?
Are there other "rels" than "up"? 
Can they be followed through link walking?

This behavior is not documented anywhere that I (or Google) could find.

Age

PS
Also, all the docs on links, even the 1.4 docs, still refer to the old 
"/riak/bucket/key" format for specifying a link target. Riak 1.3.1 rejects this 
format with a bad request error!
