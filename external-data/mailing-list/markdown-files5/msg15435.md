Hello,I have a production database which is fairly large and uses Secondary 
Indexes. I was planning to move away from Secondary Index to RIAK Search(SOLR). 
Can someone please let me know if Active Anti-Entropy will take care of 
ensuring that all the existing data that i currently have in Production will be 
automatically synced up once i move to RIAK Search and i should be able to 
search on those fields. If not, is there any configuration/Settings that can 
help me achieve this? 
Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Regards,Nirav\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_
