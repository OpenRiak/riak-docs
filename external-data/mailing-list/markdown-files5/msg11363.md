Afternoon, Morning, Evening to All -

This Recap comes to you live from Falmouth, MA. On the off chance that
anyone is in/around the area and wants to talk about databases, ping me.

A few things to take care of before we move on:

\\* We've got about half the RICON East videos live (including Reid's talk on
Riak CS that went live this morning), so go watch them and buy a ticket to
West while you're are it.
- http://ricon.io/archive/2013/east.html

\\* Basho is hiring a few more Technical Evangelists, specifically in Austin,
TX and the Washington, D.C., area. If you or someone you know is interested
in making Riak the biggest database in the world (adoption, not LOC), ping
me. Check out this blog post if you're looking for more info on what TEs do
here at Basho.

Enjoy.
