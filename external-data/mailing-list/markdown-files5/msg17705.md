Hi all,

I’ve been trying to increase the backlog that riak uses when opening a 
listening socket with HTTP, as I’ve seen a fair number of backlog overflow 
errors in my use case (we have a 10 node riak cluster which takes a lot of 
traffic, and we certainly expect the peak of concurrent traffic to exceed the 
default backlog size of 128). I just found out that there appears to be no way 
to customize the backlog that riak passes to webmachine/mochiweb, as indicated 
by this issue (https://github.com/basho/riak\\_api/issues/108). Can anyone 
recommend a way to increase this backlog without having to modify and recompile 
the riak\\_api, or without switching to protocol buffers? Is there any set of 
erlang commands I can run from the attachable riak console to change the 
backlog and restart the listening socket?
