The Recap took an (unplanned) August vacation, rather like the rest of the 
civilized world, but we're back.

The most important news: RICON West tickets are still available, but early bird 
ticket sales end Thursday morning (US). If you've been to a RICON, you know why 
you shouldn't miss this; if you haven't, don't miss this chance.
