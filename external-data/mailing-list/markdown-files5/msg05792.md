&gt; Is it possible to incrementally add to a file in Luwak using PUT and the
Content-Range header. I just assumed that it was but I can't seem to

were before. The reason I want to do this is because we have some pretty

Hmm? You can read from a file and write to the http socket. There is no
reason or need to load the entire contents into memory.

I don't know what client you're using, but I do know the Python client is
broken in this regard. It erroneously loads the full content into memory.
But there is nothing from the Riak server that demands such an approach.
