What is the 'eventually consistent' result of simultaneous inserts of
different values for a new key at different nodes? Does partitioning
affect this case?

&gt; OR, you can cover those aspects of the CAP concept with an in-memory
&gt; caching system and a sort of a locking mechanism to emulate the core atomic
&gt; action of your application (put-if-absent) then I would say, you are in the
&gt; right place,

What happens if the partitioning that riak is so concerned about
happens between the inserter and the lock - or the nodes providing
redundancy for the lock?

&gt; All this said, it is at your hands and tools to have an in-memory cache and
&gt; locking mechanism.

If you have more than one writer, doesn't this need to be just as
distributed and robust as riak?
