<pre>Hi Fred,

I wasn't aware of this work. Thanks for bringing it to my attention. We’ve been 
in similar positions before where it was unavoidable to use a “db scan”. This 
certainly merits review.</pre><pre>

Thanks,
Andy.

Subject: Re: RIAK Roadmap Workshop

Thank you, Andrew, and Bet365 for hosting this event, and for shepherding Riak 
through these difficult times.

I will not be able to attend, but under enhancements, I would encourage the 
group to discuss the late enhancements to Riak/KV to support efficient bucket 
and key listing for sorted back ends.  This work can be found on the develop 
and develop-2.2 branches of riak_kv; it was not formally shipped in any Basho 
production releases, but listing buckets has seen some testing (and the code 
changes are relatively small).

Listing buckets in time proportional to the number of buckets (not the number 
of keys in the cluster), and keys in a bucket proportional to the number of 
keys in the bucket (not the number of keys in the cluster) seems like a 
laudable goal for which I am sure customers would find use cases.  Key listing 
has always been an operation known to kill large clusters, and the advice has 
always been, &quot;don't do that&quot;, despite its obvious utility.  With these changes, 
that advice can be dropped for a subset of users.

-Fred

 Hi,

We are beginning to plan out the two day workshop [1]. We are thinking the 
first day will start with an introduction from Martin Davies, in which Martin 
will detail current status and the asset list.

After which we will get into project questions, such as:

Which license?
The general consensus is Apache2. We need to complete the discussion as 
HyperLogLog has been introduced which is GPL’d. Our thoughts are to replace HLL.

Baseline?
We have heard some discussion around where to baseline the codebase. The 
concern is during the demise of Basho the correct level of diligence was not 
applied to promotes meaning the code such as HLL has crept in.

Governance?
How are we to manage the project going forward? Our feeling is we do not need a 
formal body as being discussed in the slack group. We see the project going 
forward as a simple repo into which likeminded developers agree and contribute 
changes. Placing overbearing procedure and structure on what is currently a 
small community will dissuade other from joining and contributing.

Supporting infrastructure.
The Basho websites, github account, and mailing group are all included in the 
deal. We are currently supporting the mailing list, and once the deal is 
complete we will continue to support the Basho domains; restricting community 
disruption.

Roadmap
Below, in no particular order, are the items we wish to address internally. If 
we can all share our lists we can come to an agreed community roadmap between 
us.

•         Review / rationalisation of Basho JIRA tickets / git issues

•         Replication
o    Address known issues (30+) to add stability
o    Selective replication
o    Persistent realtime queue
o    Review of general approach
•  In / out of band
•  Snapshot vs deltas

•         General
o    Address known issues (20+) to add stability
o    Silent data loss bug in riak_kv

•         Enhancements
o    G Sets
o    Big Sets
o    CRDT Maps
o    Async read / write vnodes
o    Split backend vnodes
o    Head requests – don’t return body to co-ordinator
o    Rudimentary indexing (leverage TS work)

•         Consolidation / feature cross population of KV,CS, and TS codebases

•         Erlang / OTP upgrade


At this point we want to keep the structure of the day loose to allow the 
conversations to flow, our collective priorities to take precedence.

The sessions will be live streamed, with details to follow.

We will also man IRC / Slack for discourse.

Food and refreshments will be provided throughout the two days.

Hopefully this gives us something to discuss in the build up to the 12th Oct. 
We’re looking for everyone’s input so we can hit the ground running.

As a quick update on the status of the purchase. We have exchanged funds and 
the court process continues. One clarifying point for anyone following the 
court proceedings. The purchasing company is our technology arm, Hillside 
Technology Limited, not the bet365 group.

Thanks,
Andy.
