&gt; Thanks Russ.
&gt; 
&gt; I wasn't passing comment on any of the HLL work, only the GPL dep.

&gt; Subject: Re: RIAK Roadmap Workshop
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; I don't want to hijack the thread, thanks for posting the roadmap, I hope all 
&gt; other interested parties can do the same. It's going to be a very valuable 
&gt; meet up and I look forward to attending.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I'm sorry for being a picky picky pedant but I worked with the guy 
&gt; who built the HLL feature, and it is a thorough, diligent, and professional 
&gt; feature added as part of the release cycle. I was concerned about the GPL 
&gt; dependancy (Proper) but after some investigation it looks like it is OK since 
&gt; it is not shipped with Riak or linked in anyway, instead it is a test only 
&gt; dependancy brought in by the dependancy on Hyper (but we should still get 
&gt; more clarification there.) But the HLL work itself is top drawer, thoroughly 
&gt; tested, and reviewed (perhaps more so than many Riak features.)
&gt; 
&gt; I do think that in the develop and unreleased branches there is probably 
&gt; questionable code that isn't yet production ready, but I need to defend the 
&gt; HLL work. It's good work. It's my fault that you've got the wrong end of the 
&gt; stick about the HLL work because of my concerns over the GPL dependancy. 
&gt; Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; 
&gt; Russell

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We are beginning to plan out the two day workshop [1]. We are thinking the 
&gt;&gt; first day will start with an introduction from Martin Davies, in which 
&gt;&gt; Martin will detail current status and the asset list.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; After which we will get into project questions, such as:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Which license?
&gt;&gt; The general consensus is Apache2. We need to complete the discussion as 
&gt;&gt; HyperLogLog has been introduced which is GPL'd. Our thoughts are to replace 
&gt;&gt; HLL.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Baseline?
&gt;&gt; We have heard some discussion around where to baseline the codebase. The 
&gt;&gt; concern is during the demise of Basho the correct level of diligence was not 
&gt;&gt; applied to promotes meaning the code such as HLL has crept in.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Governance?
&gt;&gt; How are we to manage the project going forward? Our feeling is we do not 
&gt;&gt; need a formal body as being discussed in the slack group. We see the project 
&gt;&gt; going forward as a simple repo into which likeminded developers agree and 
&gt;&gt; contribute changes. Placing overbearing procedure and structure on what is 
&gt;&gt; currently a small community will dissuade other from joining and 
&gt;&gt; contributing.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Supporting infrastructure.
&gt;&gt; The Basho websites, github account, and mailing group are all included in 
&gt;&gt; the deal. We are currently supporting the mailing list, and once the deal is 
&gt;&gt; complete we will continue to support the Basho domains; restricting 
&gt;&gt; community disruption.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Roadmap
&gt;&gt; Below, in no particular order, are the items we wish to address internally. 
&gt;&gt; If we can all share our lists we can come to an agreed community roadmap 
&gt;&gt; between us.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ·         Review / rationalisation of Basho JIRA tickets / git issues
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ·         Replication
&gt;&gt; o    Address known issues (30+) to add stability
&gt;&gt; o    Selective replication
&gt;&gt; o    Persistent realtime queue
&gt;&gt; o    Review of general approach
&gt;&gt; §  In / out of band
&gt;&gt; §  Snapshot vs deltas
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ·         General
&gt;&gt; o    Address known issues (20+) to add stability
&gt;&gt; o    Silent data loss bug in riak_kv
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ·         Enhancements
&gt;&gt; o    G Sets
&gt;&gt; o    Big Sets
&gt;&gt; o    CRDT Maps
&gt;&gt; o    Async read / write vnodes
&gt;&gt; o    Split backend vnodes
&gt;&gt; o    Head requests - don't return body to co-ordinator
&gt;&gt; o    Rudimentary indexing (leverage TS work)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ·         Consolidation / feature cross population of KV,CS, and TS codebases
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ·         Erlang / OTP upgrade
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; At this point we want to keep the structure of the day loose to allow the 
&gt;&gt; conversations to flow, our collective priorities to take precedence.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The sessions will be live streamed, with details to follow.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We will also man IRC / Slack for discourse.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Food and refreshments will be provided throughout the two days.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Hopefully this gives us something to discuss in the build up to the 12th 
&gt;&gt; Oct. We're looking for everyone's input so we can hit the ground running.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As a quick update on the status of the purchase. We have exchanged funds and 
&gt;&gt; the court process continues. One clarifying point for anyone following the 
&gt;&gt; court proceedings. The purchasing company is our technology arm, Hillside 
&gt;&gt; Technology Limited, not the bet365 group.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Andy.
