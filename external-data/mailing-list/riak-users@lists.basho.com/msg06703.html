Ryan, 

Thank you for the informative reply. </pre><pre>

&gt; - does riak search have the ability to do a join?  A feature we heavily use 
&gt; from the lucene unstable branch is the ability to do a &quot;hash join&quot; 
&gt; (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2272">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2272</a>).    
&gt; Our use case is we have documents of type User    who have  BlogPosts.      
&gt; We want to match all the BlogPosts that mentioned &quot;tires&quot; and where their  
&gt; User's description mentions  &quot; taxi driver&quot;.    We can't index all the User 
&gt; data into each Blog Post because we have ~400+  million blog posts and  ~2+ 
&gt; millions of Users with both growing.    We need the search to be in realtime 
&gt; so its not a situation where we could do background processing.  Is there a 
&gt; way to model this with  riak search?
&gt; 
&gt; No.  To satisfy this query you'd have to denormalize and put some user data 
&gt; in the blog post index (probably as an inline field).

Regarding denormalizing, I don't think its possible in our situation because we 
would be added up to MBs of data per each document.  Would it be possible to do 
a search for User docs,then feed all those ids into a map reduce function that 
does another search against BlogPosts that match the search term and the user 
ids?   

I still plan to try out riak to see if we can use it.  I'll let you all know of 
the progress.  I see you guys are in Boston, I'm there often and would love to 
stop by your office sometime.



&gt; Jason,
&gt; 
&gt; In general Riak Search is far from a Solr/Lucene clone.  It's main relation 
&gt; is that it supports the Lucene syntax and has an HTTP interface that roughly 
&gt; looks like Solr but doesn't support a lot of it's features and also has 
&gt; different semantics in some cases.
&gt; 
&gt; If you rely on specific Lucene/Solr functionality, such as joins or specific 
&gt; analyzers then Riak Search is probably not going to fit the bill.  Some Riak 
&gt; users have chosen to integrate with external solutions such as Solr or 
&gt; Elasticsearch.  As you mention this poses potential consistency issues and 
&gt; more deployment work, but perhaps you can work around those things.
&gt; 
&gt; More comments inline...

&gt;  I'm considering moving a fairly large data instance to riak because of the 
&gt; distributed nature and because of full integration with search. Avoiding the 
&gt; work of keeping solr and a datastore in sync sounds great.
&gt; I've gone through the wiki pages regarding search and I have a couple of 
&gt; questions.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; -  Are the search scores returned from the solr/search interface accessible 
&gt; to the client running the search? 
&gt; 
&gt; This probably depends on the client but I don't see why the score shouldn't 
&gt; be exposed.
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; - Is the scoring system built to be modifying by developers? In our current 
&gt; system, we have a modified solr scoring system to model our needs.  If I did 
&gt; want to modify it, would it coded in java or erlang?
&gt; 
&gt; No, it's hardcoded in Erlang.  There is currently no way to customize it like 
&gt; you can in Lucene.
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - I have searched around and I have not seen many case studies of using riak 
&gt; search with large amounts of keys.  I'm not even sure what large means for 
&gt; riak.  Our total data size of indexed data is about 500 million docs and 
&gt; growing. Most docs are small, about 64kb in size, but we also have a couple 
&gt; million docs that are multi mbs.
&gt; 
&gt; The concern isn't so much the number of objects you store/index as it is the 
&gt; number of objects that match any given query.  For example, an AND operator 
&gt; with a large result set on one side can cause serious performance issues 
&gt; because of Search's distributed nature (it has to stream/merge sort the 
&gt; postings from both sides).  This can be alleviated with inline fields but at 
&gt; a cost of a larger index.  Also, the size of the object shouldn't affect 
&gt; Search because it's streaming postings in most cases but there is a practical 
&gt; limit with Riak in general.  We say don't go past 40MB or so but I would say 
&gt; the practical limit is much, much lower.  Giving you a hard number would be  
&gt; foolish on my part because something like that is going to depend greatly on 
&gt; your hardware/software stack.  You need to benchmark with real data and real 
&gt; load to know for sure.  But to be pragmatic, I'd probably say in the single 
&gt; digit MBs.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; -  According to this page: 
&gt; <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Querying.html#Query-Scoring">http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search---Querying.html#Query-Scoring</a>  there is no 
&gt; actual idf score?  How are documents actually ranked then if no idf is used?  
&gt; if docs get matched on a query on different nodes, how is the order of 
&gt; results reassembled without using know the total number of documents in a 
&gt; collection?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to punt on this for now.  I'll try to get back to you with an 
&gt; answer later.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - does riak search have the ability to do a join?  A feature we heavily use 
&gt; from the lucene unstable branch is the ability to do a &quot;hash join&quot;

&gt; No.  To satisfy this query you'd have to denormalize and put some user data 
&gt; in the blog post index (probably as an inline field).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - Is this a bug in riak search and has this been solved? 
&gt; <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users_lists.basho.com/2012-January/007114.html">http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users_lists.basho.com/2012-January/007114.html</a>
&gt; 
&gt; No, it has not been addressed.
&gt;  
&gt;       
&gt; - can indexing and indexes be used together? I see there is support for doing 
&gt; exact/range queries in search if riak already can index dates?
&gt; 
&gt; Are you asking if you can use 2i and Search together?  If so, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; Search can do everything 2i can do.  The main difference at this point is the 
&gt; API and the query engine.  Search uses term-based partitioning whereas 2i is 
&gt; document-based.  Both have their pros/cons, but the main thing to take away 
&gt; is Search only has to query one node for a term query, 2i has to query 1/N of 
&gt; the nodes.  I've talked about this before on the mailing list.  I can dig up 
&gt; the threads if you want more information.
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; -finally is there a way to measure what kind of ram/hardware will be needed 
&gt; to support the indexes?
&gt; 
&gt; Capacity planning is tricky, to say the least.  Both 2i and Search use 
&gt; sequential log, generational merging techniques (2i uses leveldb, Search uses 
&gt; our in-house index merge_index).  Estimating disk/memory overhead for a given 
&gt; document in Search is also difficult since it relies on the data, the 
&gt; analyzer and other field options.  It should be fairly easy to add an API to 
&gt; Search to take a document, do a dry-run, and tell you disk/memory overhead, 
&gt; but currently there is no such thing. We do have some general capacity 
&gt; planning pages but nothing specifically on Search.
