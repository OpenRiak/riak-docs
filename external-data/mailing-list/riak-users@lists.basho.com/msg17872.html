<pre>Hi guys,
I've switched our configuration around, so that Riak CS now talks to
127.0.0.1:8087 instead of the haproxy version.</pre><pre>

We have immediately re-encountered the problems that caused us to move to
haproxy.
On start-up, riak takes slightly longer than riak-cs to get ready, and so
riak-cs logs the following then exits.
Restarting riak-cs again (so now 15 seconds after Riak started) results in
a successful start-up, but obviously this is really annoying for our ops
guys to have to remember to do after restarting riak or rebooting a machine.

How do other people avoid this issue in production?

&gt; Hi Shaun,
&gt; We've been running Riak CS since its early days, so it's possible best
&gt; practice has changed.. but I'm sure at some point it was suggested to put a
&gt; haproxy between CS and KV to guard against the issues of start-up race
&gt; condition, individual KV losses, and brief KV restarts.
&gt; I'm sure we used to have continual issues with CS being dead on nodes
&gt; before we moved to the haproxy solution. That was probably on Debian
&gt; Squeeze though, and these days we're on Ubuntu LTS, and so if CS is
&gt; launched from Upstart at least it can retry to start, whereas on old-school
&gt; init systems it just gets one attempt and then dies.
&gt;
&gt; Moving on though--
&gt;
&gt; Even if it's not the majority practice, shouldn't CS still be able to
&gt; withstand dropping and reconnecting it's protocol buffer TCP connections?
&gt;
&gt; CS still has a problem with not handling the case when its long-standing
&gt; idle PBC connections to KV get reset. Regardless of whether that's because
&gt; the local KV process is restarted, or because we've failed over to a new
&gt; haproxy.
&gt; The errors get pushed back to the S3 client software, but even if they
&gt; retry, they get repeated errors because, I think, CS has such a large pool
&gt; of PBC connections. You have to work through a large portion of this pool
&gt; before you finally get to one that's reconnected and is good.
&gt;
&gt; In our case, the pool size is multiplied by the number of CS instances, so
&gt; quite a large number.
&gt; Most client software has retry limits built in, at much lower values.
&gt;
&gt; While it will come good eventually, there's a significant period of time
&gt; where everything fails, all our monitoring goes red, etc. which we'd like
&gt; to avoid!
&gt;
&gt; I'm surprised this problem doesn't come up more for other users; I don't
&gt; feel like we're running at a large scale.. but maybe we're using a more
&gt; dynamic architecture than major users.

&gt; Hi Toby,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I thought that it was recommended AGAINST talking to a co-located Riak
&gt; on the same host?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure where you heard that from, but that's not the case.  We do
&gt; discourage running other parts of an application on the same hosts, such as
&gt; client front-ends for example.  From the top of my head (which means
&gt; there's probably an exception to the rule), all our customers have nodes
&gt; set up in the way Magnus described: one CS instance talking locally to its
&gt; KV instance directly on the same node.  The load balancing comes between
&gt; the CS node and the client.
&gt;
&gt; Riak shouldn't take a particularly long time to start at all.  We have
&gt; customers that have terabytes of data per node and a KV node can be
&gt; restarted in just a minute or two.  As long as you have valid bitcask hint
&gt; files in place (which requires a proper shutdown beforehand), then a node
&gt; should come up quickly.  If you have nodes that you feel are taking a
&gt; particularly long time to start up, that may be a symptom of another issue
&gt; unrelated to this discussion.
&gt;
&gt; If, for any reason, you need to shut down KV, you would then just remove
&gt; the CS node from the HAproxy configuration so it doesn't deal with any
&gt; requests.  The other CS nodes then take the additional load.  There
&gt; shouldn't be a need to restart CS if you remove it from the load balancer.
&gt; Having said that, you shouldn't have to worry about restarting CS as far as
&gt; I'm aware.  You might see failures if KV is down, but once it's up and
&gt; running again, CS will continue to deal with new requests without
&gt; problems.  Any failures to connect to its KV node should be passed to the
&gt; client/front-end, which should have all the proper logic for re-attempts or
&gt; error reporting.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm surprised more people with highly-available Riak CS installations
&gt; haven't hit the same issues.
&gt;
&gt; As I mentioned, our customers go with the setup Magnus described.  I can't
&gt; speak for setups like yours as I've not seen them in the wild.
&gt;
&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt; Shaun

&gt; Hi Magnus,
&gt; I thought that it was recommended AGAINST talking to a co-located Riak on
&gt; the same host?
&gt; The reason being, the local Riak will take longer to start up than Riak
&gt; CS, once you have a sizeable amount of data. This means Riak CS starts up,
&gt; fails to connect to Riak, and exits.
&gt; You also end up in a situation where you must always restart Riak CS if
&gt; you restart the co-located Riak. (Otherwise the Riak CS PBC connections
&gt; suffer the same problem as I described in my earlier email, where Riak CS
&gt; doesn't realise it needs to reconnect them and returns errors).
&gt;
&gt; Putting haproxy between Riak CS and Riak solved the problem of needing the
&gt; local Riak to be started first.
&gt; But it seems we just were putting the core problem off, rather than
&gt; solving it. ie. That Riak CS doesn't understand it needs to re-connect and
&gt; retry.
&gt;
&gt; I'm surprised more people with highly-available Riak CS installations
&gt; haven't hit the same issues.

&gt; Hi Toby,
&gt;
&gt; As far as I know Riak CS has none of the more advanced retry capabilities
&gt; that Riak KV has. However, in the design of CS there seems to be an
&gt; assumption that a CS instance will talk to a co-located KV node on the same
&gt; host. To achieve high availability, in CS deployments HAProxy is often
&gt; deployed in front of the CS nodes. Could you please let me know if this is
&gt; an option for your setup?
&gt;
&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt;

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; Now that we're all back from the end-of-year holidays, I'd like to bump
&gt; this question up.
&gt; I feel like this has been a long-standing problem with Riak CS not
&gt; handling dropped TCP connections.
&gt; Last time the cause was haproxy dropping idle TCP connections after too
&gt; long, but we solved that at the haproxy end.
&gt;
&gt; This time, it's harder -- we're failing over to a different Riak backend,
&gt; so the TCP connections between Riak CS and Riak PBC *have* to go down, but
&gt; Riak CS just doesn't handle it well at all.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a trick to configuring it better?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Toby

&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt; We've been seeing some issues with Riak CS for a while in a specific
&gt; situation. Maybe you can advise if we're doing something wrong?
&gt;
&gt; Our setup has redundant haproxy instances in front of a cluster of riak
&gt; nodes, for both HTTP and PBC. The haproxy instances share a floating IP
&gt; address.
&gt; Only one node holds the IP, but if it goes down, another takes it up.
&gt;
&gt; Our Riak CS nodes are configured to talk to the haproxy on that floating
&gt; IP.
&gt;
&gt; The problem occurs if the floating IP moves from one haproxy to another.
&gt;
&gt; Suddenly we see a flurry of errors in riak-cs log files.
&gt;
&gt; This is presumably because it was holding open TCP connections, and the
&gt; new haproxy instance doesn't know anything about them, so they get TCP
&gt; RESET and shutdown.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is that riak-cs doesn't try to reconnect and retry
&gt; immediately, instead it just throws a 503 error back to the client. Who
&gt; then retries, but Riak-CS has a pool of a couple of hundred connections to
&gt; cycle through, all of which throw the error!
&gt;
&gt; Does this sound like it is a likely description of the fault?
&gt; Do you have any ways to mitigate this issue in Riak CS when using TCP load
&gt; balancing above Riak PBC?
&gt;
&gt; Toby
