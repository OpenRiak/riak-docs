<pre>Hi all,Thanks for taking over riak management.I am strongly commited to
the success of this take over as we intensively use riak for our
customers solutions.Arnaud Wetzel, founder and CTO of KBRW, the company
I'm actually working for, has been contributing to riak but, due the
lack of visibility on the roadmap, we have also been maintaining our
own build of riak.Precisely, we use 3 flavours of riak:* our own build,
based on riak 1.1, with additional patches: for instance, <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://githu">https://githu</a>
b.com/basho/merge_index/pull/32* a vanilla riak 2.2* riak TS 1.3.0
As many of us, I suppose, we are really interested in sharing the
efforts on riak and want to contribute to it.
In a few words, by the past, we (ie Arnaud Wetzel :) ), has contributed
to the following features that are now integrated upstream:* IPV6
support (mainly through BEAM)* Cassandra search algorithm integration
into riak_search (pending pull request)* geoloc search, now merged into
SOLR* Symfony bundle for riak (yeah, some use it :) )
Regarding the license, we also agree on Apache 2, and would like to
avoid GPL.
Regarding the governance, we support the following points:* limit
community disruption* looking out how to mitigate the roadmap
uncertainty and lack of transparency of the recent period.We are
convinced that a better balance between community and business should
help to avoid this issue.
I need now to introduce myself with my other hat of OW2 consortium
chairman. This organization aims at supporting open source projects
providing:* supporting infrastructure: gitlab, continuous integration,
mailing lists, etc (in case project need them)* maturity assesment
tools* best practices and governance guidelines to help reaching it*
logistic support with a strong presence into international conferences,
dedicated booths for our corporate members, etc
I would be glad to join the meeting at Bet365 facilities to discussing
these points.
Regards,Jean</pre><pre>

&gt;  Hi,
&gt;  
&gt; We are beginning to plan out the two day workshop [1]. We are
&gt; thinking the first day will start with an introduction from Martin
&gt; Davies, in which Martin will detail
&gt;  current status and the asset list. 
&gt;  
&gt; After which we will get into project questions, such as:
&gt;  
&gt; Which license?
&gt; The general consensus is Apache2. We need to complete the discussion
&gt; as HyperLogLog has been introduced which is GPL’d. Our thoughts are
&gt; to replace HLL.
&gt;  
&gt; Baseline?
&gt; We have heard some discussion around where to baseline the codebase.
&gt; The concern is during the demise of Basho the correct level of
&gt; diligence was not applied to
&gt;  promotes meaning the code such as HLL has crept in. 
&gt;  
&gt; Governance?
&gt; How are we to manage the project going forward? Our feeling is we do
&gt; not need a formal body as being discussed in the slack group. We see
&gt; the project going forward
&gt;  as a simple repo into which likeminded developers agree and
&gt; contribute changes. Placing overbearing procedure and structure on
&gt; what is currently a small community will dissuade other from joining
&gt; and contributing.
&gt;  
&gt; Supporting infrastructure.
&gt; The Basho websites, github account, and mailing group are all
&gt; included in the deal. We are currently supporting the mailing list,
&gt; and once the deal is complete
&gt;  we will continue to support the Basho domains; restricting community
&gt; disruption.
&gt;  
&gt; Roadmap
&gt; Below, in no particular order, are the items we wish to address
&gt; internally. If we can all share our lists we can come to an agreed
&gt; community roadmap between us.
&gt;  
&gt; ·        
&gt; Review / rationalisation of Basho JIRA tickets / git issues
&gt;  
&gt; ·        
&gt; Replication
&gt; o   
&gt; Address known issues (30+) to add stability
&gt; o   
&gt; Selective replication
&gt; o   
&gt; Persistent realtime queue
&gt; o   
&gt; Review of general approach
&gt; § 
&gt; In / out of band
&gt; § 
&gt; Snapshot vs deltas
&gt;  
&gt; ·        
&gt; General
&gt; o   
&gt; Address known issues (20+) to add stability
&gt; o   
&gt; Silent data loss bug in riak_kv
&gt;  
&gt; ·        
&gt; Enhancements
&gt; o   
&gt; G Sets
&gt; o   
&gt; Big Sets
&gt; o   
&gt; CRDT Maps
&gt; o   
&gt; Async read / write vnodes
&gt; o   
&gt; Split backend vnodes
&gt; o   
&gt; Head requests – don’t return body to co-ordinator
&gt; o   
&gt; Rudimentary indexing (leverage TS work)
&gt;  
&gt; ·        
&gt; Consolidation / feature cross population of KV,CS, and TS codebases
&gt;  
&gt; ·        
&gt; Erlang / OTP upgrade
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; At this point we want to keep the structure of the day loose to allow
&gt; the conversations to flow, our collective priorities to take
&gt; precedence.
&gt;  
&gt; The sessions will be live streamed, with details to follow.
&gt;  
&gt; We will also man IRC / Slack for discourse.
&gt;  
&gt; Food and refreshments will be provided throughout the two days.
&gt;  
&gt; Hopefully this gives us something to discuss in the build up to the
&gt; 12th Oct. We’re looking for everyone’s input so we can hit the ground
&gt; running.
&gt;  
&gt; As a quick update on the status of the purchase. We have exchanged
&gt; funds and the court process continues. One clarifying point for
&gt; anyone following the court proceedings.
&gt;  The purchasing company is our technology arm, Hillside Technology
&gt; Limited, not the bet365 group.
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Andy.
