<pre style="margin: 0em;">
Sean,

</pre><tt>Sure, mapping is another way, but even with very few object-encapsulated 
</tt><tt>links it's slower than header link walking, correct?  I just wanted to 
</tt><tt>treat them all the same.  More importantly, get decent response times, 
</tt><tt>appropriate for an interactive ui.  Perhaps with stored map functions 
</tt><tt>and the 0.9 addition of consecutively interleaving map and link phases 
</tt><tt>-- the two approaches have become interchangeable / complementary?  The 
</tt><tt>question is how would map+link compare to link+link in terms of 
</tt><tt>performance?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;"></pre><pre>

</pre><tt>Would these secondary key-correspondent link-storing objects use link 
</tt><tt>headers or link encapsulation?  I'm guessing it's the latter - which 
</tt><tt>Ripple calls composition (embedding)...  That would solve the &quot;very 
</tt><tt>many&quot; issue.  Yes, I'm wary about the foot thing.  Having to do map for 
</tt><tt>(some of the) links feels somewhat like that.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I started this thread for being cautious rather than expecting that many 
</tt><tt>links.  Neo4j was something I looked at and didn't like because of their 
</tt><tt>licensing and because my links are predictable (i.e. don't go to unknown 
</tt><tt>depths) as far as traversal.  Long before that, I had considered an 
</tt><tt>entirely semantic (triple store) solution - which would have been 
</tt><tt>all-links and all-standards.  While that's mentally stimulating (or 
</tt><tt>inherently &quot;good&quot;), it's even heavier time investment than riak.  Riak 
</tt><tt>does links, so I thought good chance to postpone the inevitable web of 
</tt><tt>linked data...  Yet, I'm all for best-of-breed hybrids.  That's why I 
</tt><tt>intend to use redis for some of the browsing / filtering via sets.  
</tt><tt>That's why I fancy your suggestion of riak + graphs (in another db) 
</tt><tt>too.  Thanks!
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>What if all the &quot;primary objects&quot; (json) have 1:1 key-correspondent rdf 
</tt><tt>objects (e.g. rdf-json).  The api or proxy would serve get requests 
</tt><tt>based on content-type.  And all the links (whether stored in headers or 
</tt><tt>objects) will have their triple store doubles that interconnect the rdf 
</tt><tt>objects.  The &quot;link walking&quot; would be done entirely with semantic web 
</tt><tt>standards.  The map-reduce with riak, as expected.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>This data / link duplication will probably happen with post-commit 
</tt><tt>hooks.  Are header link changes part of the new post-commit feature?  
</tt><tt>Could the hook just post the changes somewhere?  I'll have a message 
</tt><tt>queue with an http endpoint, so I can post-process the changes with 
</tt><tt>whatever language.  Nothing against erlang, only that I have zero 
</tt><tt>experience with it and too many things on my learning plate.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Last but not least, ruby has recently emerged as a full-fledged semantic 
</tt><tt>web citizen.  One of the very useful consequences is the growing 
</tt><tt>abundance of storage adapters 
</tt><tt><a  rel="nofollow" href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/2010Apr/0030.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/2010Apr/0030.html</a> -- 
</tt><tt>would anyone be interested in writing an adapter for riak...  I don't 
</tt><tt>have the time for such feat, but could gladly bleed a little on that 
</tt><tt>edge.  Thus riak may become its own graph database as well.  And if it 
</tt><tt>all ends up being stored in Riak, then Ripple gets yet another reason 
</tt><tt>for this other type of association - i.e. :graph :)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Too far out?  It would make ruby more special.  Yet that's kind of the 
</tt><tt>case anyway.

Orlin,

</pre><tt>One thing that you imply is that you would always be using the Link 
</tt><tt>header to represent links.  Another way to cope with large numbers of 
</tt><tt>links is to encapsulate them in the object itself, rather than in the 
</tt><tt>headers.  This removes the header-length/count limitation, but would 
</tt><tt>require you to have a map function that understands the internals of 
</tt><tt>the object.  Also, you would need to deal with the larger size of the 
</tt><tt>object, which could potentially slow down your request.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>In Ripple, I intend to support secondary link-storing objects through 
</tt><tt>associations.  You would associate the secondary object by key (i.e. 
</tt><tt>it would have the same key as the owner), and then that secondary 
</tt><tt>object would have a link association to the targets.  Then the 
</tt><tt>origin/owner object would have the transitive association via a simple 
</tt><tt>method delegation.  As I told the Raleigh Ruby group on Tuesday, &quot;I 
</tt><tt>want to provide just enough tools to shoot yourself in the foot.&quot; 
</tt><tt> Having a convention is helpful, but won't substitute for thoughtful 
</tt><tt>evaluation of your data model.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>One of the &quot;other options&quot; that I didn't mention was a graph database. 
</tt><tt> If your model seems to beg lots and lots of links, you might be 
</tt><tt>better off looking at something that fits the traversal model better, 
</tt><tt>like Neo4J, AllegroGraph, etc.  You could still use Riak for storing 
</tt><tt>the primary objects, but keep your tightly interrelated stuff in the 
</tt><tt>graph DB.  Remember, nosql is about choice and using the best tool for 
</tt><tt>the job!

Riak Users,

</pre><tt>Thinking about a data modeling pattern that will allow one to not 
</tt><tt>worry about how many links can be had with one-to-many (or 
</tt><tt>many-to-many) scenarios.  This question has come up before in various 
</tt><tt>places.  One answer I like is Sean's from this thread 
</tt><tt><a  rel="nofollow" href="http://riak.markmail.org/thread/6e7ypt5ndjzjk7mr">http://riak.markmail.org/thread/6e7ypt5ndjzjk7mr</a> saying: &quot;... at the 
</tt><tt>point where you have that many links it becomes necessary to consider 
</tt><tt>other options, including intermediary objects or alternative ways of 
</tt><tt>representing the relationship&quot;.  I wonder if an _intermediary way_ 
</tt><tt>could be baked into Ripple (or your client library of choice).  This 
</tt><tt>is for the cases when one-to-many can become one-to-very-many.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>To make it more interesting, let's say we want to add metadata to the 
</tt><tt>relationship as described in the pre-last paragraph of 
</tt><tt><a  rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.basho.com/2010/03/25/schema-design-in-riak---relationships/">http://blog.basho.com/2010/03/25/schema-design-in-riak---relationships/</a>.  
</tt><tt>Here is what I have in mind: 
</tt><tt>{from}-&gt;{from_association}-&gt;{association}-&gt;{to} -- the {curlied} are 
</tt><tt>bucket / objects and -&gt; are links.  For example if {from} = &quot;user&quot;; 
</tt><tt>and {association} = &quot;interest&quot;; and {to} = {whatever} there is 
</tt><tt>interest in - e.g. &quot;event&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, &quot;story&quot;, another &quot;user&quot; or even 
</tt><tt>self-interest :)  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Let's use a 
</tt><tt>recent example from Basho's blog where a &quot;user&quot; links {to} = &quot;task&quot;.  
</tt><tt>So we get: user -has--&gt; user_interest -meta--&gt; interest -in--&gt; task.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The &quot;interest&quot; association could imply &quot;ownership&quot; but maybe the 
</tt><tt>application allows its &quot;users&quot; to express interest another's &quot;task&quot;.  
</tt><tt>Maybe it's a collaborative effort...  Reverse-linking from the many 
</tt><tt>interests / tasks to their respective owners is easy because it's 
</tt><tt>just a single link for task -of--&gt; user or interest -of--&gt; user.  In 
</tt><tt>the interests bucket I want to put all kinds of useful metadata.  
</tt><tt>There I would embed (via Composition as Ripple calls it) not only all 
</tt><tt>the &quot;tags&quot;, but also &quot;notes&quot;, &quot;star&quot;, etc.  Think delicious bookmarks 
</tt><tt>or google reader items and so on.  It seems like a common pattern.  
</tt><tt>Something that may fit the use case of @botanicus too.  One could 
</tt><tt>represent all possible links (various associations) between two 
</tt><tt>objects as metadata contained in a given &quot;interest&quot;.  Ownership can 
</tt><tt>be a type of interest for the sake of link-walking.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

There are three things happening here:
1. the &quot;very many&quot; (links through intermediary objects)
</pre><tt>2. optional metadata (yet another intermediary object) - multiple 
</tt><tt>associations between any two objects can be expressed through extra 
</tt><tt>metadata rather than extra links
</tt><tt>3. reusing the &quot;very-many&quot; and / or metadata intermediaries 
</tt><tt>-linking--&gt; to objects in different buckets
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The real issue (that #1 solves) is not having an easy ability to do 
</tt><tt>&quot;very many&quot; links originating from the same object.  The #2 metadata 
</tt><tt>object vs a few extra links for tags / notes (which are insignificant 
</tt><tt>compared to the many interests a user can have) - makes it easier (in 
</tt><tt>my eyes) to put in Redis for filtering...  Of-course interests (#2) 
</tt><tt>could be specialized (different metadata models) with regards to what 
</tt><tt>they are about (#3).  On delicious that's just bookmarks.  I've got 
</tt><tt>close to 6,000 of them.  Does that approach &quot;very many&quot; in terms of 
</tt><tt>Riak?  If &quot;very many&quot; were easier to do (with client-library models 
</tt><tt>or otherwise Riak itself) #2 &amp; #3 would be indifferent about which 
</tt><tt>intermediary leads to them (an extra link-walk step) as they are 
</tt><tt>already possible anyway.  How could we step (automagically) through 
</tt><tt>an intermediary object (the user_interest &quot;very many&quot; enabler bucket) 
</tt><tt>- having a specific target object in mind?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>I think it may already be possible with current link-walking.  Then 
</tt><tt>it's all a matter of managing the intermediary bucket / objects.  Not 
</tt><tt>exactly sure how the max links are calculated.  According to one 
</tt><tt>formula from the mailing list I may get 1000 headers (limit in 
</tt><tt>mochiweb) * 200 links (&quot;around 40 chars per link&quot;) = 200,000 links 
</tt><tt>max?  That seems like &quot;very many&quot;, but there was also something about 
</tt><tt>performance burden...  If we took those 200 with just a single 
</tt><tt>header, pointing to 200 intermediary objects, each pointing to 
</tt><tt>another 200 target objects we would get 40,000 links.  That's quite a 
</tt><tt>few.  Of-course that number could easily get much much bigger (square 
</tt><tt>the default limit).  What decides how many links per intermediary 
</tt><tt>object is ideal?  Is it a setting that Basho could recommend a 
</tt><tt>default for?  Could Ripple automate that?  Some link creation logic 
</tt><tt>is needed and if Riak doesn't support it, the client libraries that 
</tt><tt>do &quot;associations&quot; are a good candidate for the task.  Also with link 
</tt><tt>deletion - we'll need to either keep track of link count per 
</tt><tt>intermediary or run map-reduce jobs to clean-up once in a while...
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>In either case, link creation should be as simple as knowing which 
</tt><tt>intermediary object is the last one and whether we should add the 
</tt><tt>next new link through it or through a new intermediary (when a 
</tt><tt>certain link count _setting_ is reached).  If this could be automated 
</tt><tt>then it wouldn't matter how many the links are.  Otherwise Riak would 
</tt><tt>have to be monitored and if certain links begin to get &quot;very many&quot; 
</tt><tt>then a model migration is run to make the transition from few 
</tt><tt>straight links to very many.  If client libraries could work with 
</tt><tt>both kinds of links then this transition would mean tweaking the 
</tt><tt>model association (and link walking remaining the same).  But when 
</tt><tt>using Riak's raw interface there would be a difference, which means a 
</tt><tt>switch from one-to-many to one-to-very-many will usually take some 
</tt><tt>thinking / effort.  Any time I'm in doubt, it seems safer to side 
</tt><tt>with the very-many (just in case).  What is the cost of an extra step 
</tt><tt>of link-walking as compared to changing application code?
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>As another example, if one were to build GitHub with Riak, how would 
</tt><tt>you model the watching &amp; following associations?  Many users would 
</tt><tt>use few, but some would use many, which in a few cases get to be very 
</tt><tt>many, which means everybody will watch and follow in very-many 
</tt><tt>style.  If the app ui allows it, one has to assume it will happen...  
</tt><tt>Here is the following / watching example for very many - different 
</tt><tt>words for having interest in something:
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

* separate very-many:
user -does--&gt; user_following -what--&gt; user
user -does--&gt; user_watching -what--&gt; repo (-of--&gt; user)
* combined very-many:
user -has--&gt; user_interest -for--&gt; {whatever}
* combined very-many + metadata:
user -has--&gt; user_interest -meta--&gt; interest -for--&gt; {whatever}
* and if metadata was different, perhaps:
user -has--&gt; user_interest -meta--&gt; interest_user -what--&gt; user
user -has--&gt; user_interest -meta--&gt; interest_repo -what--&gt; repo

</pre><tt>Whatever the pattern, it would be nice to have the best practices 
</tt><tt>defined and implemented for reuse (via association-proficient client 
</tt><tt>libs - a la Ripple).  After all, Riak users like big data, which is 
</tt><tt>another way of saying very many items of stuff -- and why not very 
</tt><tt>many hands / links too :)
