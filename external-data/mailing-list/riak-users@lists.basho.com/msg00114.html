<pre>Don't fall into the trap of &quot;one size fits all&quot;. Riak is an amazing product
that can solve a number of tough problems. I don't think this is one of
them. You need/want a triple store to (correctly) model this sort of
problem. You need flexible schemas, ontologies, and a graph based query
language.</pre><pre>

&gt;  Riak Users,
&gt;
&gt; Thinking about a data modeling pattern that will allow one to not worry
&gt; about how many links can be had with one-to-many (or many-to-many)
&gt; scenarios.  This question has come up before in various places.  One answer
&gt; I like is Sean's from this thread
&gt; <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://riak.markmail.org/thread/6e7ypt5ndjzjk7mr">http://riak.markmail.org/thread/6e7ypt5ndjzjk7mr</a> saying: &quot;... at the point
&gt; where you have that many links it becomes necessary to consider other
&gt; options, including intermediary objects or alternative ways of representing
&gt; the relationship&quot;.  I wonder if an _intermediary way_ could be baked into
&gt; Ripple (or your client library of choice).  This is for the cases when
&gt; one-to-many can become one-to-very-many.
&gt;
&gt; To make it more interesting, let's say we want to add metadata to the
&gt; relationship as described in the pre-last paragraph of
&gt; <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.basho.com/2010/03/25/schema-design-in-riak---relationships/">http://blog.basho.com/2010/03/25/schema-design-in-riak---relationships/</a>.
&gt; Here is what I have in mind: {from}-&gt;{from_association}-&gt;{association}-&gt;{to}
&gt; -- the {curlied} are bucket / objects and -&gt; are links.  For example if
&gt; {from} = &quot;user&quot;; and {association} = &quot;interest&quot;; and {to} = {whatever} there
&gt; is interest in - e.g. &quot;event&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, &quot;story&quot;, another &quot;user&quot; or even
&gt; self-interest :)  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Let's use a recent
&gt; example from Basho's blog where a &quot;user&quot; links {to} = &quot;task&quot;.  So we get:
&gt; user -has--&gt; user_interest -meta--&gt; interest -in--&gt; task.
&gt;
&gt; The &quot;interest&quot; association could imply &quot;ownership&quot; but maybe the
&gt; application allows its &quot;users&quot; to express interest another's &quot;task&quot;.  Maybe
&gt; it's a collaborative effort...  Reverse-linking from the many interests /
&gt; tasks to their respective owners is easy because it's just a single link for
&gt; task -of--&gt; user or interest -of--&gt; user.  In the interests bucket I want to
&gt; put all kinds of useful metadata.  There I would embed (via Composition as
&gt; Ripple calls it) not only all the &quot;tags&quot;, but also &quot;notes&quot;, &quot;star&quot;, etc.
&gt; Think delicious bookmarks or google reader items and so on.  It seems like a
&gt; common pattern.  Something that may fit the use case of @botanicus too.  One
&gt; could represent all possible links (various associations) between two
&gt; objects as metadata contained in a given &quot;interest&quot;.  Ownership can be a
&gt; type of interest for the sake of link-walking.
&gt;
&gt; There are three things happening here:
&gt; 1. the &quot;very many&quot; (links through intermediary objects)
&gt; 2. optional metadata (yet another intermediary object) - multiple
&gt; associations between any two objects can be expressed through extra metadata
&gt; rather than extra links
&gt; 3. reusing the &quot;very-many&quot; and / or metadata intermediaries -linking--&gt; to
&gt; objects in different buckets
&gt;
&gt; The real issue (that #1 solves) is not having an easy ability to do &quot;very
&gt; many&quot; links originating from the same object.  The #2 metadata object vs a
&gt; few extra links for tags / notes (which are insignificant compared to the
&gt; many interests a user can have) - makes it easier (in my eyes) to put in
&gt; Redis for filtering...  Of-course interests (#2) could be specialized
&gt; (different metadata models) with regards to what they are about (#3).  On
&gt; delicious that's just bookmarks.  I've got close to 6,000 of them.  Does
&gt; that approach &quot;very many&quot; in terms of Riak?  If &quot;very many&quot; were easier to
&gt; do (with client-library models or otherwise Riak itself) #2 &amp; #3 would be
&gt; indifferent about which intermediary leads to them (an extra link-walk step)
&gt; as they are already possible anyway.  How could we step (automagically)
&gt; through an intermediary object (the user_interest &quot;very many&quot; enabler
&gt; bucket) - having a specific target object in mind?
&gt;
&gt; I think it may already be possible with current link-walking.  Then it's
&gt; all a matter of managing the intermediary bucket / objects.  Not exactly
&gt; sure how the max links are calculated.  According to one formula from the
&gt; mailing list I may get 1000 headers (limit in mochiweb) * 200 links (&quot;around
&gt; 40 chars per link&quot;) = 200,000 links max?  That seems like &quot;very many&quot;, but
&gt; there was also something about performance burden...  If we took those 200
&gt; with just a single header, pointing to 200 intermediary objects, each
&gt; pointing to another 200 target objects we would get 40,000 links.  That's
&gt; quite a few.  Of-course that number could easily get much much bigger
&gt; (square the default limit).  What decides how many links per intermediary
&gt; object is ideal?  Is it a setting that Basho could recommend a default for?
&gt; Could Ripple automate that?  Some link creation logic is needed and if Riak
&gt; doesn't support it, the client libraries that do &quot;associations&quot; are a good
&gt; candidate for the task.  Also with link deletion - we'll need to either keep
&gt; track of link count per intermediary or run map-reduce jobs to clean-up once
&gt; in a while...
&gt;
&gt; In either case, link creation should be as simple as knowing which
&gt; intermediary object is the last one and whether we should add the next new
&gt; link through it or through a new intermediary (when a certain link count
&gt; _setting_ is reached).  If this could be automated then it wouldn't matter
&gt; how many the links are.  Otherwise Riak would have to be monitored and if
&gt; certain links begin to get &quot;very many&quot; then a model migration is run to make
&gt; the transition from few straight links to very many.  If client libraries
&gt; could work with both kinds of links then this transition would mean tweaking
&gt; the model association (and link walking remaining the same).  But when using
&gt; Riak's raw interface there would be a difference, which means a switch from
&gt; one-to-many to one-to-very-many will usually take some thinking / effort.
&gt; Any time I'm in doubt, it seems safer to side with the very-many (just in
&gt; case).  What is the cost of an extra step of link-walking as compared to
&gt; changing application code?
&gt;
&gt; As another example, if one were to build GitHub with Riak, how would you
&gt; model the watching &amp; following associations?  Many users would use few, but
&gt; some would use many, which in a few cases get to be very many, which means
&gt; everybody will watch and follow in very-many style.  If the app ui allows
&gt; it, one has to assume it will happen...  Here is the following / watching
&gt; example for very many - different words for having interest in something:
&gt;
&gt; * separate very-many:
&gt; user -does--&gt; user_following -what--&gt; user
&gt; user -does--&gt; user_watching -what--&gt; repo (-of--&gt; user)
&gt; * combined very-many:
&gt; user -has--&gt; user_interest -for--&gt; {whatever}
&gt; * combined very-many + metadata:
&gt; user -has--&gt; user_interest -meta--&gt; interest -for--&gt; {whatever}
&gt; * and if metadata was different, perhaps:
&gt; user -has--&gt; user_interest -meta--&gt; interest_user -what--&gt; user
&gt; user -has--&gt; user_interest -meta--&gt; interest_repo -what--&gt; repo
&gt;
&gt; Whatever the pattern, it would be nice to have the best practices defined
&gt; and implemented for reuse (via association-proficient client libs - a la
&gt; Ripple).  After all, Riak users like big data, which is another way of
&gt; saying very many items of stuff -- and why not very many hands / links too
&gt; :)
