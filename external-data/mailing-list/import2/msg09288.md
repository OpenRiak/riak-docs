Hey All,

Mark here. The great people at FOSDEM have just announced that the CFP
for the NoSQL Dev Room.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHRnOWNMeEN5VHc0cVJmUDRMakVXY1E6MA

I just wanted to pass this along in the event that anyone is planning
to go (or thinking about it) and wants to get ambitious and submit a
Riak-related talk. (Perhaps you're already planning to do so, in which
case you're already my hero.)

I'm happy to help support you in whatever way needed if you're
interested in representing Riak.

Thanks,

Mark
