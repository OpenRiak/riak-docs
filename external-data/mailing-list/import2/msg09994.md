Hey everyone, 

Just shipped two releases of riak-js today. 0.9.3 [1] is a minor bug fix 
release. It should now be installable on Windows too, because there's really no 
reason it shoudn't.

The 0.10.0pre1 release brings preliminary support for Protocol Buffers, based 
on Nathan LaFreniere riakpbc library [2]. It's based on an ongoing pull request 
[3], which I'm working on completing.

While still not fully complete (streaming keys and mapreduce are still pending, 
but I'm close to having those in there), I wanted to throw it out for testing.

So please have at it, and report oddities [4] :)

Cheers, Mathias
