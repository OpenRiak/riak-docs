I've been looking at CEPH a lot lately. Object storage in a cluster of
identical nodes. It can be used for hosting raw block devices (like Amazon
EBS) or object storage over http (like S3). It works like luwak - objects
are chunked into smaller pieces and replicated around the
cluster independently.

S3 Interface:
