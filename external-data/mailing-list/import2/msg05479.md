Thanks for all the suggestions. 

Let's not worry about the problem of ensuring uniqueness right now - I have 
that part solved separately.

Rohman, this approach is what I described as a "manual index". It adds a good 
deal of code that I'm hoping to avoid by using 2i or search. This whole thing 
is a balancing act between performance, code complexity and to some extent disk 
space. I'm trying to evaluate which approach gives me the best of all 3.

Manual Index:
 - Adds lots of code complexity
 - Requires only 2 gets look up a user - one to the index to retrieve the 
primary key, then the lookup of the primary key
 - Not much extra space used.

Search:
 - Barely any extra code
 - Have to index user objects, so about 2x as much space is required
 - Since search uses term-based partitioning, querying should be pretty fast 
in theory. Write performance will take a hit due to indexing.

2i:
 - Barely any extra code
 - Unsure of amount of extra space required - think it won't be too much
 - Because of document-based partitioning, there is overhead in talking to a 
coverage set when only one machine will have the result I'm looking for. The 
significance of this overhead is what I'm really trying to evaluate.
