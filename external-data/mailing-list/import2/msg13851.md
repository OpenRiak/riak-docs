I'm trying to remember some of the pain points of Riak in production on EC2
back 2.5 years ago. Riak is a different product now, but EC2 is still a
challenging environment.

Do you have any monitoring on the state of network interfaces? Is it
possible the IP of one of the nodes changed from underneath you?
In general, random EC2 network problems (which are plentiful) result in
Erlang problems, and they have resulted in Riak getting confused.
