Riak Recap returns after a busy couple of weeks, including one of the more 
spectacular developer conferences anywhere in the world, Strange Loop. If 
you've not yet attended, you're missing out.

Garrett Eardley of Riot Games talked at Strange Loop about migrating from MySQL 
to Riak for scale; we'll definitely post a link to that talk when it goes 
public.

A few upcoming events:

If you're in Berlin and you hurry, you can catch eBay and Wooga talking about 
using Riak in about an hour:

Basho is hosting a party for Erlang Workshop '13 this Friday:

If you're in the Chicago area next week, Basho engineers will be in town for 
two days of Erlang goodness:

\* GOTO Night Chicago, October 3rd, where Steve Vinoski will be talking about 
implementing Riak in Erlang

\* Erlang Factory Lite, October 4th, where Chris Meiklejohn and Sean Cribbs will 
be talking

And of course, San Francisco, October 29-30, RICON West returns for another 
opportunity to see how academics and industry are solving our toughest problems 
in distributed systems.
