Hi I have successfully installed Riak in ubuntu in my vmware virtual box in
windows 7. It was working fine when I was applying some command from
terminal. I want to use Riak from my Eclipse from Windows environment. I am
using the java program provided by Riak site. I changed the riak IP address,
after changing I am unable to start Riak. Please help me in this regard. I
have made the following changes in riak.conf file.

nodename = riak@192.168.17.11

........
listener.http.internal = 192.168.17.11:8098

I refered to the following sites.

Please help to start Riak and suggest me how to run the built-in java
program from Eclipse in windows 7.
