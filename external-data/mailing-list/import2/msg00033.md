This is probably being caused the the single core you have on the EC2 node. You 
will need to enable your Erlang to be smp capable to make innostore work. Add 
the following to your /etc/riak/vm.args file (anywhere will do):
-smp enable

This is something we are going to add to the vm.args we distribute to work 
around the issue. Give the above a try and report back with any issues you 
have.
