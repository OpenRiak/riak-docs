Hi there,

I want to report again a problem I have with packagecloud.io; everytime I
do "aptitude update" I get a hit as if a new version of Riak is available
(that is not)... and I have to re-install Riak to a version I already have.

I just did an "aptitude safe-upgrade" and upgraded Riak to version 2.0.5
(latest):

# aptitude safe-upgrade
The following packages will be upgraded:
 ... ... ... riak ... ... ... ... ... ...
[...]
Unpacking riak (2.0.5-1) over (2.0.1) ...
[...]

# riak version
2.0.5

# aptitude update
Hit https://packagecloud.io trusty InRelease
Hit https://packagecloud.io trusty/main Sources
Hit https://packagecloud.io trusty/main amd64 Packages
Hit https://packagecloud.io trusty/main i386 Packages

# aptitude safe-upgrade
The following packages will be upgraded:
 riak
1 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Need to get 0 B/55.4 MB of archives. After unpacking 0 B will be used.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?]

if i select Y i get the following:

Unpacking riak (2.0.5-1) over (2.0.5-1) ...

and everytime I check for updates, "riak" comes as requiring an update
although is not true. How to fix that? makes no sense it continues coming
as needing to be upgraded when is the same exact version.

Thanks,
Alex
