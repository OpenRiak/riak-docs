Greets,

https://gist.github.com/883872

That stack trace is the product of calling Riak.mapValuesJson in a map phase
of a map reduce job. I checked the same parsing against Chrome and Firefox
and they both parse the string as I'd expect. The object, as a string, that
is being parsed is:

"{\"bar\":\"baz\\r\\nfrob\"}"

The setup is: Riak 0.14.0 on Mac OS X 10.6.6 and CentOS 5.5


Any advice / pointers, greatly appreciated. Also, let me know if there is
anything else I can do to help.

Cheers,

mike
