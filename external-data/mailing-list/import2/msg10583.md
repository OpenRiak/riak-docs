Unfortunately this would break the API in regard to backwards
compatibility with older versions of Riak. This is not to say we
wouldn't ever do that, but it does mean we'd (in general) like to
avoid it. I've opened an issue with the suggestion of simply adding
the 'X-Riak-Deleted' header for consistency.

A tombstone will exist for 3s by default. With the Java client I can
reproduce it every time with:

 IRiakClient client = RiakFactory.httpClient();
 Bucket b =
client.createBucket("sibling\_test").allowSiblings(true).execute();
 b.store("key1","value1").execute();
 b.delete("key1").execute();
 IRiakObject io = b.fetch("key1").returnDeletedVClock(true).execute();
 System.out.println(io.isDeleted());
 client.shutdown();

Honestly? No, other than "at least two or three" because of
interacting directly with them (one of which led to the PR you cited).

Yeah ... it's a hard road trying to guess how people are going to want
to use something. Personally? Since the feature exists I'd support it
if only for the sake of completeness.

I'll raise that issue this week; there probably should be. In the mean
time probably the most comprehensive information on the subject can be
found here:
