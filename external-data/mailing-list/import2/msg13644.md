Joe,

I added an integration test to the 1.4.x-develop and the 1.4.4 branch of the 
client and tried them against the latest 1.4 branch of Riak but was not able to 
reproduce your issue.

I'm using 1.4.4, and creating a PBClusterClient. 

Thanks.

Hi Joe - 

What version of the Riak Java client are you using, and which protocol 
(PB or HTTP)? 

Will take a look at it. 

Thanks!
