Wow. This looks like a great tool. Thanks for releasing it!

I threw a link to it up on the wiki :

http://wiki.basho.com/Community-Developed-Libraries-and-Projects.html#riak\_core

At some point we will be giving riak\_core its own chunk of real estate
on the wiki, but this should do for now.

Keep the code coming!
