Hello New Year's Revelers,


This is the last recap of the year and it’s a big one. The dedicated team
at Basho delivered yet another TS release, Riak TS 1.5, and it’s packed
full of new features and performance enhancements. Many thanks to all the
folks at Basho who’ve worked on Riak this year and many thanks to all of
you who participate in this community. Looking forward to hearing about how
you use Riak in the new year.


Are you working on something Riak related? Let me know and I’ll get your
talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap. Perhaps your project
could be featured on our blog [0].
