In the midst of a discussion about messaging and eventual consistency and I'm 
wondering if there's a reasonable answer to the question:

Is eventual consistency in a system that needs to know when it can start 
querying the system for the just-inserted data not a problem if there is an 
event triggered when this checkpoint is reached (like a publisher 
acknowledgement) that tells the client "remember that data you inserted a few 
cycles back? It's ready to be queried now" and takes the place of a transaction?

The concern is that eventual consistency is bad when you need to know for sure 
that data was persisted to the store and the system currently uses transactions 
to ensure this.

Thanks!
