I have been struggling with the same issue. You may want to look at
Cassandra, which handles sequential key range traversal very well.
Riak also has a problem with buckets sharing the same data storage
(buckets are essentially just a way to namespace keys), so if you have
two buckets and fill up one of them, then enumerating the keys of the
empty bucket will take a long time even though it
