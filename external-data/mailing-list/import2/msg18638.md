The latest patch for the 2.9.0 is now available.

On github the release can be found at -
https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0p4. Updated packages are also
available (thanks to Nick Adams at TI Tokyo) -
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.9/2.9.0p4/
.

Details on the fixes are available via the release notes -
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/riak-2.9.0p4/RELEASE-NOTES.md.

Previously I had announced concerns over the potential severity of an issue
1707 (https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/issues/1707) in the 2.9.0 release -
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2019-August/039368.html.
Although this issue remains unexplained, it is no longer believed to be as
a result of recent changes, or present a direct risk of data loss.

For those running earlier patches of the Riak KV 2.9.0 release, upgrading
is recommended, but the update is not considered urgent unless running
with Tictac AAE enabled.

Regards

Martin
