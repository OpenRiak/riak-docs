What do you mean by 'process'?

If you mean operating system process, then, No. A Riak instance runs in a 
single OS process. There is a Riak instance per "node" in the cluster, where a 
"node" is a machine, container, etc. Probably what the OMG guys used to call a 
"capsule" (cute) There are typically many nodes in a Riak cluster; hence 
multiple OS processes, but in general it only makes sense to run each process 
on a separate node or machine, because things break.

If you mean a lightweight Erlang process, then yes, there is an Erlang process 
per connection. From that point on, it gets ... complicated. There are 
process corresponding to coordinating finite state machines, processes (plural) 
corresponding to vnodes, and there is a long list of processes that run support 
for all things between. But all of these Erlang processes (or "actors") run in 
a single operating system process, the Erlang virtual machine, or abstract 
machine, if you learned how to computer before Java.

Does that help?
