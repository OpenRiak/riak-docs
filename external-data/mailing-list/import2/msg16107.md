The original idea was to use a Set directly. The Set-in-Map thing was
just a thought experiment (Map-in-Set would make more sense).

The intention is to store log messages in each element of the set:
either as a string (syslog or json, or whatever else the user sees fit),
or as a map of key-value pairs (where values themselves can be maps
too).

On average, the log messages are a few kilobytes in size. There may be
exceptions, but >1mb ones are fairly rare. How much data the set would
hold... now that's a question that can't really be answered. It is
really up to the syslog-ng user to configure that.

Hope that made it a little more clear.
