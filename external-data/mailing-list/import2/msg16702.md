Hi,
I've started to use RiakKV on an 11 node cluster. So far it seems to be 
working reasonably well for my application although I occasionally hit 
Timeouts on inserts and have to keep retrying in my python client.
I'm interested in giving RiakS2 a trial and given that I already have 
Riak installed on my nodes can I layer RiakS2 on top of my existing Riak 
cluster that I'm using as a key value store or should I run multiple 
riak instances listening on different ports for the 2 differing use cases ?

Cheers,
Emyr
