Hi Eric,

Thank you for your answer.

Yeah apparently, Links are not the Eldorado I though it was.
In my head it was a pointer to another record, and accessing it would be faster 
than regular requests…

I'm not really looking for more than 100 friends in one user's list really. 
(Except the rare user that will have 1000 or more friends).
When you say "a limited length", I'm not sure what you are referring… ?

Actually, more than checking if A and B are friends, I was looking for getting 
fast Information about friends, e.g. :

- retrieve all friend's information by Link Walking, like : A/B/name A/C/name 
A/D/name …

But it seems that I would not be as fast as I though ?

Thank you,

Morgan.
