It hasn't been documented anywhere (sorry) but the 1.0.0 release includes
field listing support for the solr-like interface [1].

http://localhost:8098/solr//select?q=query&fl=blurb

I wouldn't recommend setting N=1 because if you loose disks you'll lose
data. However, for loading data you could set W=1 for quicker loading.

Riak should handle the data fine as your actual object sizes are very
practical. My concern would be the types of queries you plan to run.
 Search can become overwhelmed if you search for an oft occurring term.
 Typically these types of fields are things like gender, name, color, etc.
 I.e. fields that have a small set of total terms that are repeated often.
 These are often tagging data used for classification. For these you'll
want to make use of inline fields [2,3]. In that case you use a query to
match the documents and then inline fields to further filter those results
[4].

http://localhost:8098/solr//select?q=query&filter=tag:foo&fl=blurb
