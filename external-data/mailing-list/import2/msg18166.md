Hi,

My name is Wagner, and I'm really new at Riak.
I'm trying to do some testes, for my masters degree. But I don't know how
to do it.
Its very simple, basically I have to test commands like "Select", "Create",
"Insert"

I tried, using the root user\riak user\riak attach. As you can see in the
attachments.

What I'm doing wrong ?

Sorry for any english mistakes.

Thanks,
Wagner Braz Rodrigues.
