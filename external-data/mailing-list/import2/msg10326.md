Only a week since our last Recap. We might be on to something here.

Another week closer to RICON in New York City in May. Even distributed
systems need to leverage a little locality now and again, so come join
us for some concentrated awesomeness.

Early bird pricing ends March 15, so be sure to register before then!

P.S. You may have noticed that recap.basho.com hasn't been updated
lately; we're working on some tweaks behind the scenes to make that
easier to keep updated. The Recap shall not be denied!
