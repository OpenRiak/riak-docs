Hi!

I've been kind of holding off development for a bit while the Basho team
puts the polish on 2.0 - and then I saw a tag - 2.0.0rc1 - in Github from 3
days ago.

Has riak 2.0 quietly moved in to RC mode? And if so, are we well in to
feature freeze now?

Is it OK that I'm posting this to the mailing list?

Thanks!

Dave
