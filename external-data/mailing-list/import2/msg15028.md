Hi, 

I just started to learn Riak, but encounter a problem.

I have installed Riak on my mac os using the official mac distribution.
After starting the Riak server, I can interact with it via http interface 
properly. 
Then I tried using Ruby client, and problem came. Below is the code I extract 
from Riak Ruby client github page:

> require 'riak'
> 
> client = Riak::Client.new(pb\_port: 8098)
> bucket = client.bucket('rooms')
> 
> # Get an object from the bucket
> object = bucket.get\_or\_new("index.html") # a Riak::RObject
> 
> # Change the object's data and save
> object.raw\_data = "Hello, world!"
> object.content\_type = "text/html"
> object.store
> 



When I run this program, it just hung there. After a little bit debugging, I 
found it hung in file lib/riak/client/beefcake/protocol.rb:44, which said:

> header = socket.read 5

My Ruby version is 2.1.1, Riak version is 2.0.1, Ruby client version is 2.1.0

Any ideas about this?
