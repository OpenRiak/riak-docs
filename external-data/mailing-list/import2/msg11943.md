Hi Toby,

The error you are seeing is a bug which I'm working to resolve. We're
currently in the process of reviewing a test to ensure against possible
regressions, [1] two bug fixes, [2] [3] and a modification to the copy to
clarify what "incompatible" means. [4]

For now, it's safe to assume that the 1.4.1 "incompatible" message is only
going to prevent you from inspecting details such as RAM usage in the UI
and shouldn't affect things such as cluster management.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
