Thank you. I have restarted the server several times and I don't see riak
running with 'ps ax'. The configuration is set to come up on reboot so there
shouldn't be any other instance of riak around to run.


It's not necessarily another Riak instance but some other software could 
be listening on port 8089 or 8099.


Try:

sudo netstat -nap | grep LISTEN | grep -E "8089|8099"

And see if there are any processes listening on those ports.
