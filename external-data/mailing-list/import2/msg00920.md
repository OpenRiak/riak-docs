Riak Recap for 8/18 - 8/19

1) Bryan Fink Delivered the "Riak in Action - Wriaki" Webinar yesterday.

For those of you who couldn't make it, you might want to check out the
following:

1.1) "Wriaki" has been added to the Riak Wiki as a sample app here --->

2) Q --- On a delete operation, does Riak keep vector clock values
around for a period of time? Example: a node goes down for a period.
After, let's say 5 days, how does Riak know the value in the bucket
was removed without keeping the bucket key around? (from
@jonathan\_oliver via Twitter)


 A --- Yes, vclocks are involved. Deletes are actually writes (of
a tombstone), followed by a read where R=N. If all nodes respond to
the read with the tombstone, read-repair will invoke an actual delete
on the owner nodes.

3) TheColonial and joseph\_sh had a brief chat in #riak that started
with, "What is the common practice around dealing with which riak node
to talk to if one of them goes down?"

4) mietek and justinsheey had a very short exchange about some bitcask
internals.

5) allen kicked off a concise and valuable convo in #riak with
benblack when he asked, "With the same number of replication factor,
if I add more and more nodes, will it affect the performance, or will
it stay the same?"

6) fujin, benblack, skeptomai, markanderson, seancribbs, and dysinger
had a long convo in #riak that touched on a variety of Riak-related
topics.

7) Not sure how this went unnoticed, but a few days ago @frank06
posted a quick blurb about Riak-js on the Widescript blog.
