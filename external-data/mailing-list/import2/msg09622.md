I only mention this as I too have a small userbase/data footprint for one of my 
projects and in that project I have "squashed" all fields together in a 
catchall field within a json blob exactly because of this problem. Because of 
the project size doing so is an acceptable performance hit in terms of 
processing and disk space. Separately I have also put together systems that 
have automagically constructed the appropriate RiakSearch search string. For 
example a search for "medical books" would turn into:

(title:medical\* description:medical\* title:books\* description:books\* ) AND 
group:1468Madison

Here I am specifically searching though the title and description fields and 
the default search operator in this case is OR, as set in the schema file. 
Group, in this case, is a further internal filter automatically appended. 
Again, all this happens in application space and Riak is oblivious to it.

Constructing your search strings would also apply to the magic Ryan is brewing 
with Yokozuna. Either in your application or a hook/module built into Riak.
