I am starting it like ./bash\_bench CONFIG like it indicates in the usage
with -h.

 

/etc/hosts file just has a minimum configuration

 

127.0.0.1 localhost

 

(not other names are listed)

Hi,

 

At a glance, it looks like the basho\_bench node couldn't start correctly
with a longname.

How are you starting basho\_bench?

 

This issue could be due to a misconfiguration in the hostname for your
machine.

How do your /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname look like? 

 

For information about shortnames and longnames in Erlang:

I reiterate the request to see what is wrong with my basho\_bench
configuration. I have attached the configuration as well as the output. Any
ideas as to what is wrong would be greatly appreciated. I basically used
the templates in the 'examples' folder but apparently there is something
wrong.
