Hi all,

I have Riak building on omnios, with Erlang R15B02, and Oracle JDK 1.7.0\_25.

Everything appears to be building just fine. However... even though I have
Yokozuna and Riak Control enabled in my app.config, neither are able to be
used or - it seems - start up. I can confirm that kv is working fine.

app.config: https://gist.github.com/themartorana/eb503f1d7fca798fc6c3
console.log: https://gist.github.com/themartorana/7c517c0ba5549c35540a

Oddly, console.log doesn't show any mention of Riak Control. It does show
the startup line for Solr at the end. However, the webapp only has the
following links:

riak\_kv\_wm\_buckets
riak\_kv\_wm\_buckets
riak\_kv\_wm\_counter
riak\_kv\_wm\_index
riak\_kv\_wm\_keylist
riak\_kv\_wm\_link\_walker
riak\_kv\_wm\_link\_walker
riak\_kv\_wm\_mapred
riak\_kv\_wm\_object
riak\_kv\_wm\_object
riak\_kv\_wm\_ping
riak\_kv\_wm\_props
riak\_kv\_wm\_stats

There is no admin/control, and no yz. Any attempt to link to /yz/\* or
/admin results in a 404.

I'm at a bit of a loss. There is nothing in error.log or crash.log.
yokozuna.jar builds fine. Riak Control appears to be built fine.

Any thoughts?

Cheers,

Dave

P.S. - I have also built the git rz-yz-merge-1.4.0 branch of the riak repo
on github just to be sure. Same result. Building Riak from master - while
obviously not having Yokozuna - \*does\* have Riak Control enabled. Thanks!
