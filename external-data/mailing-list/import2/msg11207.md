Hi,
 I was trying to build a sample application on my own to check the APIs 
of the corrugated Iron. When I followed the samples in the website, some of the 
APIs where missing in the library which I was using. It consumed more time for 
me to try out all the APIs in the library and find out the right one. So it 
will be helpful if you could update the samples in the website.

Thanks and Regards

Thanks for the email. While our documentation definitely needs work, I thought 
that the basics were at least covered to a reasonable extent.

Would it be possible for you to let us know the places where the docs let you 
down please? That would give us some idea of where to best start filling the 
gaps.

Thank you!
OJ

Hi Everyone,
 I am trying to explore riak using .net library 
Corrugated Iron. The api samples in their website is not up to date for the 
current version of the Corrugated Iron. If anyone have any samples or links of 
the latest Corrugated Iron api, I really appreciate sharing that with me.

Thanks and Regards
