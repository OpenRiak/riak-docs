I've found and filed a bug in the Fedora RPM -
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=929028. I have run Riak on
Fedora as specified on the website docs without problems, but IMHO
it's in everyone's interest for open source projects like Riak to work
with the Linux distributors. The last time I checked, Fedora 19 will
have the latest Riak (1.3.1), although the window for changes is
closing and in the absence of testers, things tend not to get done.
