Hi,

Does this mean that you are using a single connection to each node in your 
test? If this is the case I would recommend increasing the number of threads as 
Dmitri Zagidulin recommended in his response in order to get better throughput. 

Also, what is the size of the objects you are writing?

Best regards,

Christian
