Vincenzo / Jared,
That makes sense and yes I'm planning on benchmarking on a real cluster
although I don't have one setup yet. For now I'll adjust my local config on
Jared's recommendation.

Reid,
Thanks for bringing that up and yes I'm using paginated 2i.


Has anyone here stopped using 2i because it stopped scaling well at some
point? If so, which point was that? Any quantifiable information would be
helpful. I'm asking this again as I had a strong recommendation not to use
2i at a large scale, and instead use basic riak key value to implement such
capabilities. Does anyone share a similar experience? Or a different one at
all?


Thanks,
Wagner
