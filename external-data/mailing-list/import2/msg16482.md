Hi Matthew,

I've been trying to get the Riak Mesos framework to compile and I've
been having difficulty. Is there a definitive document that shows how
to get the beta running? I've filed numerous issues and keep running
into compilation difficulties; it appears that it requires a specific
version of Ubuntu to compile and it uses a outdated version of godep
to compile dependencies.

For what it's worth, the Go developers I've talked to have advised
that godep should no longer be used for dependency management, and the
Makefile for the project seems to assume a number of dependencies are
installed without actually testing that they are present.

Has anyone else had success with getting this running?
