Hi Ricardo,

Full bucket read is not supported yet by Riak KV. If you're able to
upgrade, Riak TS does support that feature.

Otherwise, with Riak KV, you could use a range of 2i indexes. See
https://github.com/basho/spark-riak-connector/blob/master/docs/using-connector.md#reading-data-from-kv-bucket
for more info.
