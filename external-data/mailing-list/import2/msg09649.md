Sorry guys, indeed the problem was with different erlang versions.
We moved all node to machines with erlang version:

$ erl
Erlang R15B (erts-5.9) [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:0] [hipe] 
[kernel-poll:false]

and the problem seems to have gone away.
Feels stupid and sorry for myself that we didn't looked into this before.

Thanks a lot guys.
