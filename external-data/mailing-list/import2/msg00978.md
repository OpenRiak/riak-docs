the data in the cart does not change as this will only be stored when
the user has made the payment, the only thing that will change in the
cart will be the status of the transaction. whether it has been paid
or not.

with this in mind do you think it is still better to keep the carts in
a different bucket to the store?

on the graph database in your wiki
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Riak+Compared+to+Neo4j would i
need to push the data into this or does riak provide (will) have this
built in? i am more interested in the storage of the initial data.
