I think you're missing a key point here, and that is that the vector clock 
doesn't store copies of the \*values\*, only the individual "touches" of 
identified clients. I'm not sure what computing the common ancestor is going to 
give you if you don't have the value. Vector clocks are essentially opaque to 
clients.

That said, I think the use-case you gave is one that can clearly bubble up to 
the user, e.g. "Someone else changed this record while you were editing it. Can 
you resolve the differences?" (Give the other person's name perhaps, highlight 
the fields that are different.)
