Hi Hank,
We are looking into bringing new packages onto packagecloud but when this will 
become available is not confirmed. In the meantime, TI Tokyo will continue to 
make new packages available on https://files.tiot.jp/riak/ . There are plans 
underway to make everything a little more transparent but we will have to wait 
a little longer for them to come to fruition.

Best regards,

Nicholas

Subject: Looking for the official repository for riak packages

Hello,

I'm trying to understand what is the plan for official riak releases and where 
to find packages.

In the 2.2.6 announcement, Nicholas Adams provided 
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.2/2.2.6/ as the location for binary packages. 
Is this correct? Is there a plan to publish packages on packagecloud again?

Thanks and regards,
Hank
