Hi, all. Is the Ruby Riak::Client thread safe? I'm wondering if it's safe to 
share a single Riak::Client instance across all threads in an application. I 
might run the app in JRuby, by the way.

Are there any pros and cons to sharing a single client you can offer?

An obvious pro is that it saves some memory, but probably an insignificant 
amount.

Thanks,
Keith
