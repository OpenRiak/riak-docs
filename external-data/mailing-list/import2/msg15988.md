Hi José,

Please refer to this document:

http://basho.github.io/riak-nodejs-client/classes/RiakObject.html

When you retrieve a value, you get a RiakObject back:

client.fetchValue({ bucket: 'test', key: 'foo' }, function (err, rslt) {
 var riakObj = rslt.values.shift();
});

This RiakObject exposes several methods related to metadata.

I just released version 1.1.0 which adds support for links. You'll see
that in the API docs now.
