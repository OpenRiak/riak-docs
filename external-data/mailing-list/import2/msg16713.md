Hi folks,

Sorry if this is the wrong venue for cuttlefish questions - please 302 
me to the right place if need be.


I would like to use cuttlefish in my application, but can't see how to 
hook it in. Doing the schemas is
quite obvious - I have a small set of mappings ready to go. I just don't 
see in the cuttlefish docs how

to make my application cuttlefish-aware.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Michael
