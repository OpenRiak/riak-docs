 Hi,
I've been working on getting Riak to run inside Docker containers - in a
multi-machine cluster. (Previous work I've seen has only run Riak as a
cluster all on the same machine.)
I thought I had it cracked, although I tripped up on the existing issue
with Riak and lockfiles[1]. But the nodes have been generating an awful lot
of errors like the below, and I wondered if anyone here can give me an
explanation? (And, is it a problem?)

2015-10-21 01:19:23.567 [error] <0.24495.0> Error folding keys for
"/var/lib/riak/bitcask.1h/2283596
30832953580969325755111919221821239459840/2.bitcask.data":
{incomplete\_hint,4}

1: Related issues to the lockfiles --
I note that many are closed, but the problem still exists, and is
particularly triggered by using Docker and stopping/killing Riak more
violently than it likes.
