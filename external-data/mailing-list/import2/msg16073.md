Is there a way to do a restore without rebuilding these indexes though? 
Obviously this could take a long time depending on the amount of indexed data 
in the cluster. It's a fairly big gotcha to say that Yokozuna fixes a lot of 
the data access issues that Riak has, but if you restore from a backup, it 
could be useless for days or weeks.

As far as disk consistency, the nodes were stopped during the snapshot, so I'm 
assuming on-disk it would be consistent within a single node. And cluster 
wide, I would expect the overall data to fall somewhere between the first and 
last node snapshot. AAE should still repair the bits left over, but it 
shouldn't have to rebuild the entire Solr index.

So the heart of the question can I join a node to a cluster without dropping 
it's Solr index? force-replace obviously doesn't work, what is the harm in 
running reip on every node instead of just the first?

Thanks for the help,
Jason
