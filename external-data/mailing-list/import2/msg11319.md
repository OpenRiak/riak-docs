David,

Riak does indeed work on EC2, we have many customers who deploy exclusively
to EC2. We also happened to do some large cluster testing on ec2 this week
so I know nothing has suddenly gone awry.

Your problem seems to be you using your external IP rather than your
internal IP in your configuration. Try changing to internal IP. For AWS,
here are a couple of pages on our docs that will probably be really helpful.

http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/installation/Installing-on-AWS-Marketplace/
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Performance-Tuning-AWS/

Good luck,
Jared
