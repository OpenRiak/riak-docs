As of about 5 minutes ago the new Riak Java 2.0 RC1 client is cut.

The master branch in the Java client repo reflects this version:

https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/tree/master

I've released it to maven central, but these days it takes about 3 - 4
hours for it to be synced over to the public repository. Once it shows
up in maven central, the new artifact info is:


com.basho.riak
riak-client
2.0.0.RC1


I realize the Javadoc is sparse (and missing in some places). After a
much needed break I'll be working on that for the final release.

Thanks!
