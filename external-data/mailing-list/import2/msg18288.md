Ah wait, no, I see it, you seem to have set the DVV enabled bucket property to 
the binary <<“false”>>, it should be a boolean atom, either ‘true' or ‘false’.

Something weird has gone on in your bucket props validation, though, as that 
should have been caught or coerced to binary long before this point. How did 
you set that bucket property on this bucket?

Cheers
