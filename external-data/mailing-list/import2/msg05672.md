Michael,

The first thing that jumps out to me is the line that says: alarm\_handler:
{set,{system\_memory\_high\_watermark,[]}}, followed by a lot of "long\_gc"
messages. My guess is that you have too much memory pressure (which can be
a problem with Bitcask when you have lots of keys) and so the Erlang VM
exits when it reaches OOM. On your next node startup, monitor the VSZ of
the "beam.smp" process by using the ps command and make sure it doesn't
reach the maximum RAM in your system.

Hope that helps,
