Hi Alexander,

The node appears to be crashing due to it hitting the Erlang process limit. You 
can increase this from the default value of 32768 to e.g. the double by setting 
adding the line +P 65536 to the vm.args file. Having said that I am wondering 
what is causing you to hit this limit. What ring size are you using? How are 
you querying your data?

Best regards,

Christian
