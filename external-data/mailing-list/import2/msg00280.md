Riak Recap for 5/5

1) Q --- Something not clear to me: does riak offer a facility to
link buckets to each other (similar to how it's done for documents) ?

 A --- In a sense, buckets are "virtual", so there is no way to
link them. They are simply namsespaces and they don't really "exist"
unless you change their properties.


2) Here is a link to a conversation about data migration that might be
of interest to anyone upgrading from 0.9 to 0.10.1

(in the convo, they refer to "Grant's Approach" - this is here:
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2010-May/001120.html

\* update - the code for the "riak-admin leave" command has been pushed
to tip -- http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/changesets (commit 1262)


3) @b6n released a Riak cookbook that is now in the Opscode repo.

You can check it out here - >

There is also a pointer to it in the Riak wiki under "Getting Started."
