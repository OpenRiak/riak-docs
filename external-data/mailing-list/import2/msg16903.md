 Paulo,You can find a list of community maintained PBC pooling ‎libraries in the Erlang sub-section of this page: ‎http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/libraries/#Community-LibrariesII was under the impression that Riak Erlang client ships with poolboy ‎so I'm uncertain of the distinction between the different libraries listed.Perhaps someone could comment to clarify?Bryan From: Paulo AlmeidaSent: Wednesday, December 30, 2015 10:40 PMTo: riak-users@lists.basho.comSubject: Connection multiplexing in the Erlang clientHi,Does the Erlang Riak client support multiplexing multiple concurrent calls in a single TCP connection? Specifically when using the PB interface (riakc\_pb\_socket:start\_link).Thanks.Regards,Paulo
