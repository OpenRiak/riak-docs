Hi,

I am wondering if there are some best practice or recommendation for how
many keys inside a single bucket?

Let's say I have some sensors reporting data every 5 seconds, I can put all
these data under one single bucket, or I can dynamically generate a bucket
every day.

My question is, is there any performance difference for "insert", "query"
etc. between them? for example, 1 million records under one bucket and
10k records under 100 buckets ?

Thank you.

Br,
Alex
