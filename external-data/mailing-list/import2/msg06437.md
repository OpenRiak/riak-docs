Ok, so now I can see in the "leaving" node logs:
2012-01-26 19:18:23.015 [info]
<0.32148.2873>@riak\_core\_handoff\_sender:start\_fold:39 Starting handoff of
partition riak\_kv\_vnode 685078892498860742907977265335757665463718379520

<0.32148.2873>@riak\_core\_handoff\_sender:start\_fold:87 Handoff of partition
riak\_kv\_vnode 685078892498860742907977265335757665463718379520 from '
r...@leaving.compute-1.amazonaws.com' to '
r...@ec2-othernode.compute-1.amazonaws.com' completed: sent 5110665 objects
in 3905.97 seconds

so things \*are\* moving but at a rate of 1308 records per second.
This sounds very slow to me, accounting for the small record size, the high
bw rate inside ec2 and practically 0% load on the servers

any thoughts?
