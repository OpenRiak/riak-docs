Hi Joe,

You could do that. Riak currently supports millisecond resolution. Look at the 
primary key composition. There are two lines, the first is the partition key 
and the second is the local key. The local key denotes the sort order and is 
the actual unique key for that grouping (quanta).

You could do something like (syntax?) :

Create table test(

time timestamp not null,
micro int not null,
data varchar not null,

Primary key(

(Quantum(time, 1, m)),
time, micro

)
)
