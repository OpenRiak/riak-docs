I think this is a case of asking the wrong question. LMAX Disruptor is a
single-process abstraction, similar to an event loop / reactor. Erlang
already has this concept under the covers (use +K on the command-line to
turn on kernel-polling).

Riak (the product) is a distributed key-value store that runs on multiple
nodes (OS processes). Riak Core is the framework upon which
Riak-the-product is built, and provides cluster membership, consistent
hashing, the virtual-node abstraction, handoff and various other utilities.
None of these things talk about how work is distributed to multiple
consumers in a single process. The two have very little in common.
