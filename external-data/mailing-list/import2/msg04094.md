I ... wouldn't think so? I'm running Rabbit and it's using this Erlang
binary, but shouldn't this build be running a different Erlang
process? I'm not even sure how they could be stepping on each other's
feet.

To be clear (if it isn't obvious), I'm no Erlang developer, I just
want to be able to build master to play with secondary indexes, etc.
