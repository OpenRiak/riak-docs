Hi,
I just pushed the big red button and released 1.0.0 of the riak-java-client. 
Changes from last week's 1.0rc1 include domain object mapping for user meta, 
riak indexes and riak links, and a bug fix from chrisumbel for the HTTP 
transport (https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/pull/64)

Changes from 0.14.1, in a nutshell, are:

1. A new common API on top of two existing RiakClient classes.
2. A new API to simplify semantic reconciliation of conflicting writes 
(includes basic domain object mapping.)
3. Support for Riak search in m/r
4. Suport for Riak's secondary indexes
5. Support for all the new Riak 1.0 PB message options 
6. Replace the dependency on Apache HTTP Client 3.1 with 4.1

See the CHANGELOG and the README for details.

Get it here 
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/com/basho/riak/riak-client/1.0.0/

It should be synced to Maven Central within the hour. Just update your pom 
dependency to 1.0.0.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed!

Cheers
