Dear Riak users,

Earlier today we have released Riak TS v1.5. This release packs multiple
new features, usability and performance improvements, and bug fixes. In
best Basho traditions, we release it both as open source for the Riak
community and as Enterprise Edition for Basho customers.

The new and improved features are:

 -

 (NEW) ORDER BY clause in SELECT statement [1]
 -

 (NEW) LIMIT clause in SELECT statement [2]
 -

 (NEW) ASC / DESC keywords in CREATE TABLE definition [3]
 -

 (NEW) BLOB data type to store unstructured (e.g. binary) or opaque (e.g
 JSON) data in TS tables [4]
 -

 (NEW) SHOW CREATE TABLE command to review SQL definition and replication
 parameters [5]
 -

 (NEW) DELETE command in ‘riak-shell’ to remove TS records [6]
 -

 (NEW) EXPLAIN command to review query execution plan [7]
 -

 (NEW) Added support for Ubuntu 16, dropped Ubuntu 12 [8]
 -

 (IMPROVED) Better NULL handling in SELECT statements [9]
 -

 (IMPROVED) Query latency and execution plan, especially for read queries
 spanning multiple quantas, new configuration parameters [10]
 -

 (IMPROVED) Usability of ‘riak-shell’ tool, added multi-line paste
 functionality, built-in help for SQL commands, and enhanced error handling
 [11]
 -

 (IMPROVED) Integration of features from Riak KV 2.2 codebase [12]
 -

 … bug fixes, documentation and performance improvements, see [13] for
 details


Those users, who upgrade from previous Riak TS versions, should review
configuration changes, including added and deprecated parameters in
riak.conf [14]

Riak TS continues to generate lot of excitement with Basho customers and we
believe this release will be easier to use and will help with additional
use cases. Many of the added or improved features were done based on the
feedback from the users, and much more is on the way. Please do not
hesitate to provide feedback and requests - as you can see, we do listen.
