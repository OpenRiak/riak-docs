Hello Folks

I am looking for a really simple hook (pre or post commit) that will do
send http put of the key to a server. I could also live with some simple
send of the key via a tcp connection, or for that matter pipe the key value
to a local process

Any pointers on how to create such a hook or an example would be greatly
appreciated

Regards
Mav
