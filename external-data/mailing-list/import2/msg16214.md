Hi Kota,
Our production nodes are Riak CS 1.5 and Riak 1.4.x -- they're running
haproxy 1.4.x, and it's all been happy for some time now.

Testing the new nodes, still same haproxy versions, but Riak CS 2.0.1 and
Riak 1.0.5.
Very confused as to why the connections are being dropped when going
through haproxy. The problem persists even after restarting CS.
I tried staggering the restarts.. increasing the PB request pool.. etc..
 no change.

But it works fine if CS connects directly to the localhost riak pb.
(Which isn't a great idea.. big Riak instances sometimes take too long to
start, and CS falls over because it started too fast and couldn't connect,
if you're going to localhost)

Confusing! I'm wondering if it's because the testing machines are in
virtual machines, compared to production which is real hardware.
But.. normally haproxy still works fine on VMs.

I'll continue to play around.. Must be something that's botched on the
testing setup... but don't want to replicate that into production!
