Use another bucket, keyed by email, with the users generated ID as the value:

Bucket/key: buckets/users-by-email/bob.bar...@gmail.com
Value: Riak generated ID

There are, I am sure, race conditions and eventual consistency issues
to keep in mind, but it's good to remember that you can use key/value
operations in this manner.
