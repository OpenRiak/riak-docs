Niels,

I tested PUT object by your script (slightly modified for keys etc.) and
succeeded.
My environment:
- Riak CS, both 1.5 branch and develop branch
- node.js v0.10.25
- npm 1.3.10
- % npm ls
/home/shino/b/g/riak\_cs-2.0
└─┬ aws-sdk@2.1.16
 ├─┬ xml2js@0.2.6
 │ └── sax@0.4.2
 └── xmlbuilder@0.4.2
- script https://gist.github.com/shino/36f02377a687f8312631

maybe version difference of node or aws sdk (?)

Thanks,
Shino
