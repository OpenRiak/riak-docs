Hi Anand,

The brew install actually gives you compiled code, and no makefile. In 
addition, the startup scripts are slightly different that when installing from 
source.

I recently answered the same question on StackOverflow which should point you 
in the right direction:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9906386/running-a-three-node-riak-cluster-using-a-homebrew-installation

Basically, you need to manually make copies of the /usr/local/Cellar/riak 
directory and edit the files accordingly, including the startup scripts 
themselves. 

Please let us know if you have additional questions!

Thanks,
Brian Roach
