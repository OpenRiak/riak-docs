I would go a step further and say it would be \*really\* cool to have the M/R 
framework pluggable. One could spin up a JDK 8 Nashorn implementation (maybe 
even with a little Reactor integration thrown in for good measure ;) that 
communicated over jinterface and would like to the M/R framework like a normal 
Erlang process. Or one could use Clojure or other JVM language like Ruby, etcâ€¦ 
ZeroMQ support would be cool here as wellâ€¦using inproc or even over the 
localhost to something like Reactor [1] running in a JVM.

I'm currently playing with Reactor's Nashorn and network support such that I 
can make a Reactor participate in an Erlang topology with minimal static and 
Riak's M/R engine has been on my mind as a good way to test it.
