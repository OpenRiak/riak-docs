Sean,

I apologize if this is readily available in the docs, faq, etc. (I
obviously missed if it is).

When a cluster is repartitioned, e.g. as a result of adding or
removing vnodes, is one backend preferable to another? Does keeping
node size down help/hurt in terms of performance, reliability, etc?
