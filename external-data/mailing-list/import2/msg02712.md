I have been meaning to get familiar with Riak's allow\_mult setting so I used
this thread as an excuse to mess with it.

I created a class in python call RiakCounter that stores a value into a key
that makes conflict resolution easier when reading the value.

Here's the code. I'm sure there's probably some fatal flaw in it that Basho
and friends will quickly point out.

It's very likely that Redis is a better fit for your use case. My
implementation is pretty nasty and more complex than you expect. There seems
to be a growing trend of pairing Redis with Riak because they're
complementary. Riak = elastic scale, Redis = easy data structures, pub/sub
and speed.
