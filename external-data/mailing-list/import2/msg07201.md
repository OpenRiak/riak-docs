If you'd like, I will write a C wrapper around
riak-cpp,
obviously itself written for C++. Actually, in the interest of getting my
code into more hands, I will help you in any number of ways (e.g. provide
an implementation of Riak/PB) if you can specify your compiler and/or
runtime constraints in more detail.

Let me know.
