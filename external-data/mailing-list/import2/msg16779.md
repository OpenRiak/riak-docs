Hi Joe,

I have a similar setup, and in my case, "indexed\_s" is properly indexed. 
Are you sure that your data is really what you think it is ( i.e. real 
JSON, with the right mimetype, etc) ?

Using the default YZ index schema, I know I can index:

dataset={
 indexed\_s:"Blah"
}

I also know I can index:

dataset={
 indexed\_s:"Blah",
 notindexed: 52
}

However, when I add:

dataset={
 indexed\_s:"Blah",
 notindexed: 52,
 otherstuff:{"something":1, "something\_else":2}
}

the indexing fails. Please note all I really want to index is field 
'indexed\_s' - nothing else. Why would adding the sub dictionary 
'otherstuff' (not indexed) wreck the indexing of field 'indexed\_s'? Is 
there a way around this? I really want search to ignore 'otherstuff' - 
and it should as it does not follow the \*\_\* format.


Thanks!
