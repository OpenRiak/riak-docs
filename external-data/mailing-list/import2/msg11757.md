Vladimir,

I can explain what happened, but not how to correct the problem. The gentleman 
that can walk you through a repair is tied up on another project, but he 
intends to respond as soon as he is able.

We recently discovered / realized that Google's leveldb code does not check the 
CRC of each block rewritten during a compaction. This means that blocks with 
bad CRCs get read without being flagged as bad, then rewritten to a new file 
with a new, valid CRC. The corruption is now hidden.

A more thorough discussion of the problem is found here:

https://github.com/basho/leveldb/wiki/mv-verify-compactions


We added code to the 1.3.2 and 1.4 Riak releases to have the block CRC checked 
during both read (Get) requests and compaction rewrites. This prevents future 
corruption hiding. Unfortunately, it does NOTHING for blocks already corrupted 
and rewritten with valid CRCs. You are encountering this latter condition. We 
have a developer advocate / client services person that has walked others 
through a fix via the Riak data replicas â€¦ 

â€¦ please hold and the doctor will be with you shortly.

Matthew
