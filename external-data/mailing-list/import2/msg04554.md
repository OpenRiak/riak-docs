Hi Sean,

I have the same issue as mentioned here :
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2011-June/004639.html
It happens few time every day, the node doesn't crash, I'm not sure if I
have to be worried about this or not.

I have plenty of memory available on this server.

Here's the output of erlang.log
I'm having difficulty to decipher this stack trace.... any howto available ?
:)

Thanks

-tony
