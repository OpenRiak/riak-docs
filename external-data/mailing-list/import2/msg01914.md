The build process for Riak on Windows is not yet streamlined because
of the spidermonkey JS libraries for the erlang\_js component that need
to be built separately using a different build setup. The C code for
the bitcask component required quite a few changes to the file I/O
code, so it's still not clear what kind of side effects it will
produce. If others can participate in the testing process that would
be definitely helpful because I assume a few performance issues and
bugs will show up here and there :-)

I'm wrapping up a number of left over tasks from the previous quarter,
so I'll be working on the initial testing shortly to see how much work
still has to be done.
