Hello Hao,

I’m guessing that `todoriak\_main\_movie\_idx` is the index you removed? Can you 
check to see if there are any buckets or bucket\_types associated with that 
search\_index? Also, what version of Riak are you using? 

We have a test here w/ the pb client to test a delete: 
https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/3e749512d2df07c81def3c9c592615fd8d2d1234/riak\_test/yz\_pb.erl#L175
 
.
 I’m guessing that there may have been a race condition set in when deleting 
the index and the delete registering on all the nodes, as the operation happens 
asynchronously over cluster metadata. 

Is the error occurring on many nodes or just one?

Thanks.
