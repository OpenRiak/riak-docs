The key filter still has to walk the entire keyspace, which will make 
fetches an O(n) operation as opposed to O(1).

I was curious if anyone has any thoughts on what is more performant,
links or key filters in terms of secondary links. For example:

I want to be able to look up a user by id and email:

\*Link implementation:\*

Two buckets: user and user\_email, where id is the key of user and email
is the key of user\_email. User\_email contains no data but simply has a
link pointing back to the proper user.

\*Key Filter:\*

One bucket: user, where id\_email is the key of the bucket. Lookups
would use a key filter tokenizing the id and then looking up the id or
email based on the proper token.

Obviously both work, but I'm curious what the implications are from a
performance standpoint.

Thanks,

Andrew
