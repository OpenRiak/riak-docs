Riak Recap for 5/25

1) There was a quick convo in #riak about MapReduce operations and
listing buckets/keys.

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/414848

[Ed: Listing buckets and keys is not generally a good thing to do in
production]

2) We just announced a free webinar on the Basho Blog which will focus
on how to measure Riak performance and, more importantly, developing
your own action testing plan. Spots are limited and they are going
fast, so if you want more insight into how to best approach
benchmarking Riak, check out the blog and get yourself registered.
