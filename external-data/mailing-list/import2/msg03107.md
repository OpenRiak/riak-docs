Thanks, Jon. This is great stuff!

In case anyone is interested, I took the liberty of putting all the
Riak + RabbitMQ code in one section on the wiki:

http://wiki.basho.com/Community-Developed-Libraries-and-Projects.html#Riak-and-RabbitMQ

(I debated calling it the "Riak and Jon Brisbin" section but that
would definitely be suboptimal SEO :)

Feel free to add anything if I missed it.
