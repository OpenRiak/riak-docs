Hi Matt and all,

As I get it from your post, you already have some resolution algorithm at the 
application logic. So it looks you could activate allow-mult=true and then when 
concurrent writes happen you can be presented with multiple values in a later 
GET (these values are called siblings). At that point you can merge them, with 
your application logic resolution, and PUT back a single resolved value (that 
hands back the get causal context) that hopefully will remove those siblings 
and get your state back to a single value. 

If you do concurrently these resolutions/merges you might keep getting 
siblings, but if your resolution algorithm is correct this only means more 
resolution work and should not lead to any errors or lost data. 

Actually, if the resolution algorithm is deterministic (as in CRDTs) it can 
even be pushed inside Riak. I think this is the case for
