A quick skim over the paper seems to indicate that version vectors with
per-server entries cannot track causality among concurrent updates
coordinated by the same replica node.

Isn't version vectors with per server entries what Riak was using previous
to this change? If so, did this lack of causality tracking apply to
previous versions?
