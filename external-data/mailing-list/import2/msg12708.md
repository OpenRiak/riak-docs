 Hello,

 I want to try the following setup for a cloud-storage project :

- a cluster of x86 servers with SAS drives running Riak CS

- the replication for the metadata will be Nx3 on the servers running 
Riak


- data for the objects will be stored on a NFS shared storage (SONAS 
probably) with no replication configured on Riak (Nx1). The NFS platform 
will handle data protection instead in the backend.


 I found a similar setup in MezeoCloud.

 What do you think about this ?


 Thanks,

 Adrian.
