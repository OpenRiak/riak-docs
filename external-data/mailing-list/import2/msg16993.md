Weixi,

Are you using 2.0.0 or another 2.0.\* version?

If you look at 
https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/2.0.0/priv/default\_schema.xml#L104 
, 
sets are not stored in the default schema, as they can get large. Theyâ€™re 
indexed for search, but will not return in the result-set. In 2.0.7 and in 
2.1.3, the default schema was changed to store them. If you modify the existing 
default schema you have (stored=true), reload the schema, and reindex, youâ€™ll 
see the results.

Thanks.
