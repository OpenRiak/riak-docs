So, (Dr.) Kresten's PB client was integrated into the Basho client about 0.14. 
Basho fixed some minor bugs in it for our 0.14.1 release. As of now (1.0rc1) it 
is one of the two bedrock APIs of the riak-java-client, although it is somewhat 
smoothed over by a compatibility layer that allows you to use either HTTP or PB 
with the same API. The Basho repo has fixes to Kresten's repo, so, bottom line, 
if you want raw speed and can sacrifice API parity, use the pbc.RiakClient from 
the 1.0rc1 release of Basho's riak-java-client, it is basically Trifork code 
with some fixes.

Let me know why not, please.

Figures here (http://wiki.basho.com/Java-Client-Benchmark.html) give a more 
realistic comparison, I am seeing 2.5x-4x speed up, still not to be ignored.

I would really like to be able to mould the riak-java-client to clojure. Better 
still, it would be great to create a Statebox 
(https://github.com/mochi/statebox) like clojure client for Riak. Greg Burd (at 
Basho) and I have already talked about this, and if you're interested, 
collaboration would be cool.

I'll leave your other question to someone better informed.

Cheers

Russell
