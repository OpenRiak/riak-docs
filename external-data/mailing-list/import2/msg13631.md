Hi Matt.

Ignoring that you really shouldn't be running an app server on a
machine that's also a database server, I'm confused as to why you
would use any load balancing features of a client if that's the way
you're doing things.

Presumably you have something load balancing to your app servers, so
... just connect to the local riak node. If that machines crashes, it
seems unlikely your app server would continue running. If there's some
edge case where somehow the riak node stops responding but the app
server is still running, your load balancer should stop sending
requests to that app server.

All that said, the existing `ClusterClient` class in the 1.x Java
client is very basic/limited. All it does is round-robin requests
through the list of supplied nodes. As Sean Cribbs points out, the new
Riak 2.0 Java client will allow you to define your own node selection
code.

Thanks,
- Roach
