I've looked at netty too, but I thought Grizzly was a little more mature and I 
liked the abstractions of Grizzly better. 

I'm really looking into something like this for a proof of concept I'm doing 
that might involve Riak in a very large-scale, massively-concurrent system that 
handles large transfers of data. The "competition" POCs include Node.js and 
maybe Ruby/EventMachine. The point is to see if using Java (and/or Scala) in a 
hugely-scalable, highly-concurrent system can compete with Node.js and others 
that seem to have more momentum in that area. I'm convinced it can not only 
compete, but surpass those other platforms considering you have all the 
benefits of running on the JVM, including management/monitoring and ease of 
extension through plugins and other extension points. 

If Riak was to be the data store of record for this system, then I would 
absolutely need a highly-concurrent, non-blocking driver to access the data 
from the REST interface, which will be Grizzy HTTP and also non-blocking. 

I'm going to clean things up a little (I've only implemented get and put but 
not using the abstractions in the official driver). I think I'm going to 
refactor that a little and then I'll put it on github and let everyone know. 

Thanks!
