Referring to ACID: ACID is a property of transactions.

Riak doesn't provide any transactional facilities: there's no notion
of isolation (the 'I' in ACID; a concurrency control mechanism, such
as serializability), nor the ability to perform multiple updates
atomically against the database in an all-or-nothing fashion (the 'A'
in ACID.)

The closest you can get to having something with similar, but weaker,
guarantees in Riak, is to use the strong consistency mechanism that
provides an atomic compare-and-swap for a single register: by reading
and supplying your read context with your write you can ensure a form
of isolation (or, concurrency control) by failing write operations
that have been invalidated by a concurrent writer operating on the
same register. These operations are CP, not AP, and will not be
available if a majority of the cluster is not reachable by the node
performing the operation.

Thanks,
Christopher
