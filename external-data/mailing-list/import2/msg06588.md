I'm considering Riak for the statistics of a site that is approaching

information about each the page view and then to query that data.


Honestly, I wouldn't use stock Riak for this; the MR times will become 
prohibitive over billions of records. However, jrecursive has been 
solving a very similar set of problems at Showyou, and wrote Mecha, a 
solr/leveldb backend for Riak. Mecha provides fast, distributed querying 
on top of Riak's redundancy/distribution. There's a talk at the next 
Riak Meetup on the 23rd, and we should be releasing then as well.
