Right, 10k is probably too many keys to fetch in parallel. Though you wouldn't 
open and close 10k connections since there is a connection pool, and you can 
set an upper bound on it when you configure your client (more on that below.) 
But you could easily use a producer/consumer set up to fetch many objects in 
parallel. It depends on what you are fetching the data for, how often, and what 
you're going to do with it.

Curious. The code above is part of the integration test suite, it is run every 
time we build and doesn't usually throw an OOM exception. Did you call 
\*addInput\* 10k time in a loop before executing the map/reduce (can I see a 
snippet of code maybe, in a gist or pastebin, ideally)? Can I have a stack 
trace (a gist or pastebin is best for this also, please)? What version of the 
client did you use?

Which one? Which version etc? There are two classes called RiakClient (both 
legacy classes (one PB, one HTTP)), you can use them, but they are likely going 
to deprecated and removed in future versions. I recommend IRiakClient interface.

Like a lot of Java libraries you configure/acquire a client through a factory. 
There is an example in the README on the repo home page 
(https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client) under the heading \*Configuration\*, 
it is lower down that page. Maybe the README needs re-organising a bit.

The README, the integration tests, and this mailing list are the current best 
sources of help. I would like to spend some time writing some more detailed 
documentation and tutorials (ha, actually, \_no\_, I wouldn't, but I really 
\*should\*!)

Hopefully that helps, and if you get me that stack trace I'll try and figure 
out what is going on with the map/reduce error.

Cheers

Russell
