I had a similar issue the other day with similar symptoms. One node just 
seeming to be stuck. It turned out after much frustration looking at the Riak 
Control interface and the member\_status from other nodes, that the node that 
was leaving didn't known it was supposed to be leaving. It thought it was in a 
cluster all by itself. I had to join it back to the actual cluster. After 
that it was fine and started rebalancing. Then issued the leave command again 
and it complied.

But to be safe, try looking at member\_status on the node that is supposed to be 
leaving and make sure it actually is leaving. I got the impression that the 
other nodes that were actually still in the cluster were reporting back their 
last known state for the leaving node. But it wasn't the actual state ON the 
node itself.
