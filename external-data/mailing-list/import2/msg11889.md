Hi everyone,

We wanted to single out two RICON announcements:

## RICON code contest

We're putting up \*five free\* tickets to RICON West. If you want one,
here's what you need to do:

- Write a sample app leveraging either Counters or Yokozuna
- Write a packaging/deployment tool with BOSH or Packer
- Add SmartOS or OmniOS support to our Chef cookbooks

Our favorite solution for each will win a ticket. If this interests
you, read the blog post about it on the RICON website. [0]

## Riak training at RICON

We're offering a full day Riak training on Monday, October 28th at the
St. Regis hotel before RICON West kicks off. [1] This is the perfect
addition for any individual or team looking to get fully immersed in
Riak. The three day package is available for $799.
