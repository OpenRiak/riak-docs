Hi Payal,

Sorry for the late response here.

Are you asking if you can store data in Riak at the same time that
you're indexing it in Riak Search? If that's the case, then yes. Riak
Search will index documents using a default schema [0] assuming you've
got search enabled.

Does that answer your question?

Also, if you're still interested in testing Riak Search, you might
take a few minutes to read up on Yokozuna [1], the not-yet-supported
but future of Riak Search. :)

Hope that helps.

Mark
