Do you have a robust policy of accepting outside patches?

Of course, in the grand scheme of things this might not be your 
biggest
bottleneck, but why hashing now() when there exsists an idiomatic 
make\_ref()

solution? Am I missing something?


You're not missing anything, I think. make\_ref() seems like a logical
and reasonable alternative. As you said, however, it's not (anywhere
near) our biggest bottleneck -- last time I ran the profiler it didn't
even show up in the top 100 hotspots. :)

Thanks,
