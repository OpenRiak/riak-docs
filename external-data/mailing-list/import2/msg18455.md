Martin,
I fully agree. We started the Kyorai org log before it was public knowledge 
that bet365 (or anyone) would buy the IP of basho and done under the assumption 
that the basho repository would either be deleted or end up rotting there. The 
goal was/is to prevent fragmentation and give the community still using the 
repos a home where they can come together.

That said I think it’ll take some time getting everything back together. The 
repos there are currently the mirrors of what is on hex, and due to how hard it 
was to get changes merged to the basho repositories have all diverged to some 
degree or another. So there is work to be done to get it all back in sync. I 
can’t speak for the other people who maintain repos on Kyorai (so I suspect 
they feel the same) but I’d be eager to get it all back together and kill of 
forks.

Cheers,
Heinz
