Dear Sean,
thank you for your quick reply.

"Your reduce function can (almost) never assume that it is operating on the 
entire result set." -> wow! that totally kills my implementation... i wanted to 
use the Reduce phase to cut the array as a Limit + Pagination ( like LIMIT 10 
PAGE 2 in SQL )... but if i don't have the full result set is impossible and 
useless. I will have to get all the rows and then process it outside Riak for 
that.

"you must structure your reduce function such that it can receive as inputs 
anything that it outputs" -> what do you mean with that? can i merge Reduce 
phases? any example?

i'm building a php MVC framework in top of Riak, and i would like to clone from 
my SQL implementation as much functionality as i can, so people can easily use 
Riak as if they were using MySQL/PostgreSQL/etc without noticing.
thanks.

Rohman
