I've fooled around with paginating large lists of keys in Riak. A
technique that I have found is to emulate a set using 2i with
Lexicographically sorted keys. You can then emulate a db cursor using
a ranged 2i query to get chunks of values. You'll do repeated queries
to get chunks of data to build up the page much like a B-Tree. You'll
want to make sure your key ranges include enough items so that you're
not doing too many queries but not too large that you are needlessly
fetching too many items.

The easiest example is explain is to use date boxes for the index
value. This is problematic because your chunks are likely not to be
uniform but for the sake of demonstration I'll use dates.

To date box your objects, simply chop off the time part of the
object's ISO8601 creation date:

stories/slug1 = {"creation\_date": "2012-07-09T06:00:00Z"}
x-riak-index-date\_bucket\_bin: 2012-07-09

stories/slug2 = {"creation\_date": "2012-07-09T06:00:00Z"}
x-riak-index-date\_bucket\_bin: 2012-07-09

stories/slug3 = {"creation\_date": "2012-07-08T23:00:00Z"}
x-riak-index-date\_bucket\_bin: 2012-07-08

stories/slug4 = {"creation\_date": "2012-07-08T23:30:00Z"}
x-riak-index-date\_bucket\_bin: 2012-07-08

Then you can put a bound on the query:

"inputs":{
 "bucket":"stories",
 "index":"date\_bucket\_bin",
 "start":"2012-07-09T00:00:00Z",
 "end":"2012-07-09T25:00:00Z"
 },

That will get you all the objects for the day of the 9th. If your
page isn't full, you can fetch the objects for the 8th, etc. You'll
want to design things so that your pages are the size of your page or
larger so to prevent round trips to Riak. For instance getting a
1,000 keys and then sorting and limiting them to 20 items in the
reduce phase is nicer than fetching two or three chunks of 20 items so
that you can merge sort and limit them client side.

For a previous page you'll want to start with the last item on the
first page to get the next 20 items, etc.
