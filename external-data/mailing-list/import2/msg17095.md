Hi Markus,

You may want to subscribe to the mailing list to avoid that messages from
you are held in the moderation queue. Only subscribed members can post
directly to this list. Also, please always reply to the list address, not
to individual subscribers to keep the discussion public.

Russel just beat me to an answer. Please let us know if this solved your
issue.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
