Joe,

TS records in a given table all have the same structure and are stored
and retrieved as single objects (in Riak KV sense); the backend cannot
introspect them and only extract some fields.

Full records are read from backend and these are delivered, in chunks,
to the coordinator node (the node your client has connected to). On
receipt, columns not appearing in the SELECT clause are dropped; thus,
only the relevant columns are kept while the coordinator collects the
remaining chunks. From there, records are shipped to the client (via
temp tables if the query had an ORDER BY or LIMIT clause).

So no, the 1M blobs will be read from the leveldb backend, and they
will hog the bandwidth between storage and coordinator nodes. They
will not appear in the traffic going from the coordinator to the
client, though.
