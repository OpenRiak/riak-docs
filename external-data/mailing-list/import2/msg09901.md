I apologize if question is answered on archives, but it is not easy to
search for this. Suppose I store following JSON array,

PUT /riak/mybucket/mykey
[1359401530, 1359401531, 1359401532, 1359401533, 1359401534,
1359401535, 1359401536]

Is number 1359401530 stored as array of bytes ['1', '3'.....] in 10 bytes,
or as binary value 01010001000001101101001000111010, in 4 bytes?

Many thanks,
Boris
