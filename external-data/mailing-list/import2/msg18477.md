Hi all,
It looks like we’re moving toward shipping the open source repl code with the 
next release of Riak.

I’m canvassing for opinions about the riak\_snmp and riak\_jmx portions of the 
enterprise code. Is there anyone out there that depends on these features? I’d 
like to deprecate them in the next release, and remove them in the release 
following that.

Cheers

Russell
