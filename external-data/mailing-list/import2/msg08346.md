Awesome! :)

I am going to go out on a limb and suggest that Basho's scripts are
going to be "nicer" to your Riak nodes. We've been polling the stats
page on our Riak nodes at the rate of about once-every-10-seconds for
almost a year now with no visible performance problems, so I'm
comfortable saying that the stats JSON doesn't cause any real
problems.

That said, use whatever fits your needs. Basho's scripts don't (yet?)
let you alert based on latencies, sibling counts, object sizes, or how
many nodes you've lost from your cluster. If they complete that
functionality, I'd be happy to switch over to using the official
scripts. :)
