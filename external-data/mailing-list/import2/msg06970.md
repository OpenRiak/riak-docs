I agree that the Python client does need some work to clean it up,
and make it more idiomatic Python, but I'm not sure that a total rewrite
is necessary.

Most of the abstractions are good, but they just need a bit of cleanup.
I think there is always a tendency to assume things are unnecessarily messy,
but once you get to rewriting it you end up running into the pain points that
drove those design decisions.

If there is interest, we could just formulate a roadmap for the a set of 
breaking
changes to the existing client, and release it as a new version of the same 
project.

Things I would like to see:
 \* Cleanup the transport interface
 \* RiakObject needs to be simplified
 \* Support a RiakJSONObject subclass which has the encoding logic that is 
inside RiakObject now
 \* Indexes need to be cleaned up
 \* MapReduce interfaces feel a bit dirty
 \* Much improved exception hierarchy
 \* RiakClient / RiakBucket interface needs to cleaned up
