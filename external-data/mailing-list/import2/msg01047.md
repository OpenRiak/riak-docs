Yeah, well it looks like that. I haven't had any problems with associating an 
address to a client
through rails console for example but then I would do:

client = Client.new(:name => 'someclient')
client.address = Address.new(:address => 'abcde' )
client.save

The problem is in the form building, and I don't know if there perhaps isn't 
support for that or if
it's a bug or if I'm doing something wrong.
