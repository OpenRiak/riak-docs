Hi,

Streaming 2i indexes is not timing out, even though the client is 
configured to timeout, this coincidentally is causing the writes to fail 
(or or the opposite?), is there anything elemental that could "lock" (I 
know the locking concept in Erlang is out of the equation so LevelDB?) 
something in Riak while trying to stream a 2i index?


Basically, our cluster copier which runs every two minutes once it gets 
to this state it never exists (no timeout) and our app just starts slow 
writing (over a minute to write a key)


Not sure what's going on.

Guido.
