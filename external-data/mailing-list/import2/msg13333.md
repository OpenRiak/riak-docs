Ok, thanks for confirming!

Is it normal, that this action affects the overall state of the cluster? On
the 26th It started the regeneration and the the response times of the
cluster raised to never seen values. It was a day of heavy traffic but
everything was going quite ok until it started the regeneration process..

Have you got any advices about changing those app.config values? My cluster
is running smoothly for the past 6 months and I don't want to start all
over again :)

Best Regards
