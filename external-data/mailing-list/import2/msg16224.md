I was perform all nodes upgrade in x6 nodes cluster
and at same time 4 of them was prooceed with node name changed by steps:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/recovery/failed-node/#Node-Name-Changed

after that search indexes becomes completely broken - many data missed,
 returns different results on every requests.

Does it have any options now except re-save entire data in bucket to fix
it?
