The primary difference is that you don't need all of the extra node/process 
discovery stuff that Erlang provides when you use protobuffs, so there's less 
overhead. Your Erlang app also isn't affected when a Riak node goes down or 
comes up. Protobuffs isn't necessarily more compact that Erlang's ETF.
