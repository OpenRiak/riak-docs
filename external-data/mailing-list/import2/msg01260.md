Riak version is: 0.12.1
Bitcask version is: 1.0.3

I got some problems with transfer-encdoing: chunked when I put data into
riak, I stumbled at Riak accepting only 16372 bytes of data.
I created file of needed size: dd if=/dev/zero of=19k bs=1k count=19

then here's my console log to show you what's going on:

I guess I do something wrong with CURL, but I can't figure out what is
wrong.. Or riak won't support transfer-encoding: chunked?
