Hi David,

Look at the documentation for object deletion:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/using/cluster-operations/object-deletion/

There is also a blog post talking about this:
http://basho.com/posts/technical/riaks-config-behaviors-part-3/

When deleting an object, riak will first write a tombstone value. This
will by default live for 3 seconds before the object is deleted by the
backend (which may create a second backend specific form of
tombstone). If you do a GET on the key of the deleted object before
these 3 seconds have passed, you will get a not\_found as expected.
However, the key will still show up in key listings, map-reduce jobs,
etc.

See the links above for more details.

//Daniel
