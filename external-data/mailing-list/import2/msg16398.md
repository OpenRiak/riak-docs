Hi everyone,

Riak Search does not seem to work in a bucket whose bucket type has
write\_once = true. I could not see this mentioned anywhere in the
documentation, but I was curious if it is to be expected? It seems like the
objects never get indexed.

My bucket type is:

riak-admin bucket-type create raw\_tweets \
 '{"props": {"search": true, "search\_index": "index\_raw\_tweets",
"n\_val": 2, "allow\_mult": false, "write\_once": true}}' && \
 riak-admin bucket-type activate raw\_tweets


If I remove "write\_once":true, the objects are indexed.

Many thanks
Marius
