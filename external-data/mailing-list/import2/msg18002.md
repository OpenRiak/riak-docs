Hi Chris,
I suggest you to put some logs on this function that are involved in
handoff like handoff\_starting and is\_empty. What commands did you use to
join the nodes? :riak\_core.join('pg\_master\_app@192.168.137.100')? Did you
try to run all nodes on single machine? Do you have some errors in logs?

Now, I'm not able to run the example so I can't go in details now sorry :-(.

If you want I'm writing a series of posts about using riak\_core in elixir.
You can find it here http://medium.com/@gpad and an example of an
application at https://github.com/gpad/no\_slides

Let me know

bye
Gianluca
