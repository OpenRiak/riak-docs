Greetings,

For your review this (U.S.) holiday weekend we have some product
announcements, a bit of JDBC, and a pinch of Docker along with the
indomitable mailing list review.

As always, we want to hear from you. Let me know if you’re working on or
speaking about something Riak related and would like a shoutout. I’ll get
your talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap.

 to batching and Solr, Cuttlefish configurations, an OTP upgrade, and fixes
