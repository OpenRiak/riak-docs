Hi Riak users,

I want to start checking out Riak 2 and for that I need the new Java client

I downloaded it from Git but it will not build.
It seems to be missing a few dependencies (One of them was protobuf which I
actually downloaded and built but it did not sync)

Is there anywhere I can download the Jar or get detailed instructions of
how to build the project?

Thanks,

Shimon
