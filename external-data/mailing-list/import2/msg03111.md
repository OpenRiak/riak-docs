Riak Recap for April 18 - 19
====================

1) We added a few lines on Table Formats to the Innostore
Configuration and Tuning page on the wiki.

\* Read here --->
http://wiki.basho.com/Innostore-Configuration-and-Tuning.html#InnoDB-Table-Format

(Those of you who are keen observers will notice that it came straight
from the Innostore README on GitHub. h/t to Kresten Krab Thorup for
pointing out that the wiki page was lacking.)

2) Adam Hunter has been working Rekon, a data browser for your Riak
data, that is coming along quite nicely.

\* Definitely take a look at it if you haven't had the chance to do so
already ---> https://github.com/adamhunter/rekon

2.1) The team at SEOmoz liked Rekon so much that they wrote and
open-sourced a Rack App for serving it.

\* Code here ---> https://github.com/seomoz/rack-rekon

3) Attention Chef fans: Sean Cribbs updated the Riak Cookbook.

\* Latest here ---> http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/riak

4) There is a new Erlang meetup happening in NYC. I'm sure they
wouldn't mind some Riak users...

\* Details here ---> http://www.meetup.com/Erlang-World/?gj=wg2\_ej1b

5) Nick Campbell was looking for Riak Users in the DC/NOVA area.

\* Check this out if that's you

6) The team at VodPod is hiring developers.

\* Details here --->http://twitter.com/#!/aphyr/statuses/60800730931544065

7) Kyle Kingsbury made some enhancements to a Reduce function on Riak
Function Contrib that deletes bucket/key pairs.

\* Function is here ---> http://contrib.basho.com/delete\_keys.html
\* Change details here --->
https://github.com/basho/riak\_function\_contrib/commit/0706fc4880b10e90db18bf17015aad190bd5f3e6

Thanks, Kyle!

8) More from Function Contrib: Mikhail Sobolev made some nice changes
to an existing Erlang function that saves the output of a map to a
bucket and key .

\* Function is here ---> http://contrib.basho.com/save\_reduce.html
\* Change details here --->
https://github.com/basho/riak\_function\_contrib/commit/907aab45163f2002b56b13733250436be7eb721d
\* Related blog post (in Russian) here --->
http://dmitry-rozhkov.livejournal.com/26753.html

Thanks, Mikhail!

9) Mathias Meyer (@roidrage) wrote a post for the Basho Blog
called,"Why MapReduce is Hard."

\* Read it here ---> http://blog.basho.com/2011/04/20/why-mapreduce-is-hard/

10) Q --- Are Riak generated keys unique across buckets? (from
varworld via #ria)

 A --- Riak generated keys are just UUID's, and there is no
guarantee of uniqueness (though it's just \_very\_ unlikely that you'll
get a repeat). Buckets don't factor into the key generation. That
said, keys are independent per bucket.

\* Relevant code for key generation is here --->
