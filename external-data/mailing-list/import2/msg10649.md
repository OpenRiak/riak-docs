Riak is not intended to store objects of this size, not at the moment anyway. 
Riak CS [1], on the other hand, can store files up to several TB. That being 
said, Riak CS may or may not have other qualities you desire. It's a known 
issue [2] that the Riak object size limitations should be better documented.

Is this a single-socket, or is there some concurrency here?

Was this running the 24 (12 \* 2) uploads in serial or parallel? With a 
single-threaded workload, you're unlikely to get Riak to be able to saturate a 
disk. Furthermore, there are design decisions in Riak at the moment that make 
it less than optimal for single objects of 39MB. Single-object high throughput 
(measured in MB) is more in the wheelhouse of Riak CS than Riak on it's own, 
which is primarily designed for low-latency and high-throughput (measured in 
ops/sec). One of the ways that Riak CS achieves this on top of Riak is by 
introducing concurrency between the end-user and Riak.

Hope this helps,
