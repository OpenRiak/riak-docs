Hi all,

If I want to create a Disco cluster [ http://discoproject.org ] to build
statistics and compile data attacking Riak's SOLR directly without using
Riak, how can I do it?

In this way, I would leave Riak mainly for data IO (post/get) and leave the
heavy duty of searching and compiling data to Disco; so Riak's performance
shouldn't be affected for searching as mainly it will store and retrieve
data only.

Thanks,
Alex
