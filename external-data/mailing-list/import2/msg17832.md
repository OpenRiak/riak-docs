Hi Tomi,

For a cluster that uses the default replication factor (`n\_val`) of 3, the
behaviour you observed is expected. Secondary index queries work on a
covering set of VNodes, that include 1 replica for each KV object. With
`n\_val=3` the covering set can only be guaranteed if no more than 2 nodes
are offline at any given time. This behaviour has not changed since the 1.4
release.

As our documentation [0] states:

"Riak stores 3 replicas of all objects by default, although this can be
changed using bucket types, which manage buckets’ replication properties.
The system is capable of generating a full set of results from one third of
the system’s partitions as long as it chooses the right set of partitions.
The query is sent to each partition, the index data is read, and a list of
keys is generated and then sent back to the requesting node."

Other operations working fine is due to Riak's ability to spin up fallback
partitions (VNodes on one of the remaining nodes), that will accept and
temporarily store data while the Node that should own the data is down.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
