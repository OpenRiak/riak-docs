Hello,

i would like to know if riak has a couchdb's \_change like, to be notified of 
updates and act accordingly.

I know about the postcommit hooks but nothing seems ideal to track changes 
easily.

It seems the only way to avoid http overhead is to add zeromq or similar to be 
able to knock nodejs.
In couchdb, the continuous feed is very useful in all real time application and 
you only link one continuous http link. Node js takes care of the rest.

Anything I missed in riak ?

Thanks !

Alain
