Hi,



The counters stuff looks awesome.... can't wait to use it.

Is this already supported via the currently available clients (specifically, 
the Java 1.1.1 client)?Â 

Also, when can we expect some tutorial / documentation around using counters? I 
looked at the GitHub link, however, some use cases are not very clear (e.g. are 
all counters automatically initialized to 0? How do you initialize it to a 
different value)?

Thanks.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
