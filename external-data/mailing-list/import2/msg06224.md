Jeremy,

When you upgrade, your /etc/app.config file isn't altered (we don't want to 
blow away your previous settings). With a fresh install, there will be a new 
section in app.config for riak\_control, which you can also manually add. But, 
as Andrew already replied, riak\_control will be "official" with 1.1 and isn't 
included prior to that.
