Just to clarify... I was referring to...

Is it legal to bind Riak to a hostname instead of IP?


Yes, it's legal but it will incur the overhead of the lookup. If you're
talking about the HTTP/PBC interfaces, it's best to use IP addresses, but
for the node name, it's totally fine to use a hostname.
Will it be a significant overhead? I believe the it will just be a function
call after the initial lookup rather than a network call.
