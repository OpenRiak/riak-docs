Hey David,

So with the CRDT Map implementation, you can have a register, a counter, an
inner map, a set, and a flag embedded within a map, all with the same name
(oh my!).

In the underlying API the map entry identifier is actually made of both the
name and the type, so you can pull off that bit of trickery. You can see
this bleed through a little bit in the HTTP JSON API, where map field id's
are represented as \_ :

curl -XPOST 
http://localhost:8098/types/maps/buckets/customers/datatypes/ahmed\_info
\ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "update": {
"annika\_info\_map": { "update": { "first\_name\_register": "Annika",
"last\_name\_register": "Weiss", "phone\_number\_register": "5559876543" } } }
} '

Also since the API's been out for awhile now, doing the changes you listed
could break compatibility with other clients / users :-/

I'll take a look at getRegister and friends, and see if there's a better
way to implement them though.

Thanks,
Alex
