1. The configuration for Ripple goes like this...
 require 'ripple'
 Ripple.client.host = 'hostname-or-ip-address'

2. You could write
 x = Klass.find(key)
 if x.nil?
 x = Klass.new
 x.save
 end

Unless you meant that you need an atomic read-or-create operation. I don't
know if such a thing is possible in Ripple or Riak. Locking semantics is
really not part of the nosql "paradigm", if I understand it right.

3. Have a class save its instances in different buckets? Polymorphic types
doesn't sound like it would be possible in Ripple.
