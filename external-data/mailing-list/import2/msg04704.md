Hi Jeremy,

The max\_file\_size parameter controls when Bitcask will close the currently
active data file and start a new data file. The active data file will not be
considered when determining if a merge should occur. The default
max\_file\_size is 2GBs. This means that each partition in the system can grow
to 2GBs before the data files are considered for merging. This is likely
what you are seeing in your situation.

You can lower the max\_file\_size in the app.config file under the bitcask
section. This parameter should be specified in bytes.

This article is related to your issue:
