HI Luke,

Thank you. Makes sense.... I've always installed from source; I forget 
why. I'll switch over to package installations from now on.


Sincerely,

Robert

Hi Robert,

When you install the official Riak package for Ubuntu 14 Riak will use
an OTP release bundled with the package
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/downloads/).

Unless you have specific requirements otherwise, installing Riak from
packages is the recommended, supported method.

Thanks -

Hi Sargun,

I installed it from source on Ubuntu14.04 LTS.

I'll take a look at kerl as well; right now this issue more academic than
anything else.

Sincerely,

Robert

How did you install OTP18? When dealing with Erlang, and multiple
installs of it, I might suggest using kerl
(https://github.com/kerl/kerl). It's an excellent tool for dealing
with the problem.

Hi all,

Quick question:

I have an instance with OTP18 and I want to make it a Riak Node. I
DL/install the OTP16 patch 8 for Riak 2.1.4. How then do I use make rel
to
use OTP16 instead of the default OTP18??


Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

Robert
