Hi,

I'd be interested in the answer to this too, isn't it inevitable that in the 
underlying storage you will get compaction delays, you see the same in any key 
value store, eg if you were pushing lots of small packets of data into 
HBase/Cassandra etc... Eventually the system has to perform the compaction ? 
Not sure how you tune it so that you lower the throughput but remove some of 
the compaction times.

Rgds,
Mike
