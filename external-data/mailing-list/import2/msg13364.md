Hi Guys,

i want to build a statistics email marketing application and i want to use riak 
cs (as cdn) for storing the html/css/images files.
for this i need to 'count all the ressources of the bucket that have been 
accessed '. I am using s3 api to prorammaticly store my object(i am using 
python/django): 


>>> from boto.s3.connection import S3Connection
>>> conn = 
>>> S3Connection(aws\_access\_key\_id='DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD',aws\_secret\_access\_key='DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD',is\_secure=False,port='8080',host='xx.host.com')
>>> b = conn.create\_bucket('testpython')
>>> k = Key(b)
>>> k.key = 'jdk upload file'
>>> k.set\_contents\_from\_filename('/home/data/jdk-6u45-linux-x64.bin')


so my idea is code an application in django and intercept all the urls that 
will be accessed, and then i will have to somehow increment statistics of my 
accessed files.
Do you have any idea how to achive this through riak or riak cs API ?
And thanks for your help.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
