Hi all!

I have installed Riak on an Ubuntu 8.04 EC-2 instance and it stores all of
its' data on an EBS block (10GB). The machine is 32 bit (small). It will
accept information in a bucket easily with a curl request like this:

curl -X PUT -H "content-type: text/plain"
https://127.0.0.1/riak/example/foo --data "I have a document."

If I query the data like this:

 curl -i -k https://127.0.0.1/riak/example/foo

I get back the data, it works perfectly. (It sits behind nginx as a reverse
proxy that adds SSL).

However, if I perform this query:

https://127.0.0.1/riak/example

it never finishes executing, nor if I try https://127.0.0.1/riak/test

I have attached the conf file, if it will help, and I appreciate any time
you guys have!

Sincerely,
Tyler


The problem I am having is that I can
