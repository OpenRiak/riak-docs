I want to add one thing to my letter.

Yesturday (maybe the day before yesturday) I've joinde 3 node to cluster
plan. The I've reviewed it (to understand in which way my cluster will be
rebalanced). Then I've cleared this plan without commitment.

riak-admin member-status does not show the new nodes (that's ok). But when
I put the following in the riak console:
RCap = fun() ->
 {ok, Ring} = riak\_core\_ring\_manager:get\_my\_ring(),
 [{Node, Props} || {Node, {invalid, Props, \_Capabilities}} <-
element(8, Ring)]
 end.

I see

{'riak@boa.pleiad.uaprom',[{'riak@anole.pleiad.uaprom',{1,
 63632780342}},
 {'riak@boa.pleiad.uaprom',{3,63632777924}}]},
 {'riak@boiga.pleiad.uaprom',[{'riak@anole.pleiad.uaprom',{1,
 63632780342}},
 {'riak@boiga.pleiad.uaprom
',{3,63632777929}}]},
 {'riak@cascavel.pleiad.uaprom',[{'riak@anole.pleiad.uaprom',{1,
 63632780342}},
 {'riak@cascavel.pleiad.uaprom
',{3,63632777932}}]},
 {'riak@chameleon.pleiad.uaprom',[{'riak@ameiva.pleiad.uaprom',{4,

63631553081}},
 {'riak@anole.pleiad.uaprom
',{3,63632604763}},
 {'riak@chameleon.pleiad.uaprom
',{4340,63633309485}},
 {'riak@chuckwalla.pleiad.uaprom
',{1,63631964612}},
 {'riak@cobra.gigatrans.uaprom

 {'riak@sonoran.pleiad.uaprom

 {'riak@chuckwalla.pleiad.uaprom',[{'riak@chuckwalla.pleiad.uaprom',{934,

 63633047697}},
 {'riak@cobra.gigatrans.uaprom
',{9,63613457491}},
 {'riak@mussurana.pleiad.uaprom

 {'riak@yarara.pleiad.uaprom

boa, boiga and cascavel - this new nodes that was not joined to cluster.
chameleon and chuckwalla (and others) are old members of riak cluster.

Is it correct behaviour of riak or this is an issue?
