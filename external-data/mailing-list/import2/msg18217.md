Thanks for the writeup and detailed investigation, Martin.

We ran into these issues a few months when we expanded a 5 node cluster
into a 8 node cluster. We ended up rebuilding the cluster and writing a
small escript to verify that the generated riak ring lived up to our
requirements (which were 1: to survive an AZ outage, and 2: to survive any
2 nodes going down at the same time).

This will be a great document to refer to when explaining the subtleties of
setting up a Riak cluster.
