We shipped Riak CS 2.0.0 last night. A huge thanks goes out to all who
made it happen!

Riak CS 2.0.0 includes many improvements you can review here [3]. To list a few:
\* Integration with cuttlefish, which means new conveniences like
riak.conf for configuration
\* Enhanced conflict resolution (thanks to dotted version vectors) that
resolves situations like "sibling explosion"
\* The ability to tier storage for data files using LevelDB

Want to upgrade?

Upgrading a Riak CS system involves upgrading the underlying Riak,
Riak CS and Stanchion installations - there is much more on that here
[1]. You can download the latest code here [2]. The full release notes
are available here [3] and will continue to be updated.

Enjoy!
