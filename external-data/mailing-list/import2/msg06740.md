The problem is that amongst all replicas for a particular key,
operations are not serializable. Put another way, if there
are concurrent writes to three replicas,
there is no way to figure out a total ordering for the actions.

It's also important to note that even when you set W=N
for a write, it's possible that 1 write could succeed
and 2 could fail. The succeeding write is \_not\_ "rolled back"
when this happens. The user will see an error message
that the write didn't succeed on all replicas.

Correct, but as far as I know, there is no way to build a CAS system
on top of the primitives provided by the Riak public API. You need
a point of serialization amongst all of the replicas (for a particular key),
which Riak does not provide, for availability reasons.

Zab and Paxos are going to be your best references.
It's also worth noting that if you don't need high availability,
there are other ways of gaining durability that will give
you strong consistency and the ability to do CAS operations.
