Hi,

Currently, I need to know exactly which process occupies the network
port (OS level) and performs file IO while Riak is running (For some
research usage). I have seen tools like Erlang+drace, but it seems a
little difficult. I'm not very familiar with Erlang world, so would
you mind giving me some advice about it?

Thank you very much

Best,
Jing Liu
