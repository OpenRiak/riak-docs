Dear Riak users,

Earlier today we have released Riak TS v1.4. This is well-rounded release,
combining several new features, number of incremental improvements and bug
fixes. Please upgrade your Riak TS clusters or if you still did not, take
it for the spin. Any feedback, good or bad, is welcome. We do listen.


Release notes: http://docs.basho.com/riak/ts/1.4.0/releasenotes/

The new and improved features are:

 -

 (NEW) GROUP BY statement can be used in SELECT queries. This allows to
 condense the result set using one of Riak TS aggregation functions. [1]
 -

 (NEW) Users can now use textual date/time representations (per ISO 8601)
 in Riak TS SQL statements, without the need to translate to milliseconds
 before issuing the commands. [2]
 -

 (NEW) Global object expiration (a.k.a. TTL - time to leave) at the
 backend (LevelDB) level allows efficiently remove aged data from Riak TS.
 [3]
 -

 (NEW) Added SHOW TABLES command to list Riak TS tables from Riak Shell.
 This is in addition to riak-admin ‘bucket-type list’, which also works. [4]
 -

 (NEW) Added official support for Debian 8 Jessie, dropped Debian 6. [6]
 -

 (IMPROVED) DESCRIBE 

 command now returns quantum information, in
 addition to the columns names, types and primary key. [5]
 -

 (IMPROVED) Fine grained security using Riak TS specific permissions. [7]
 -

 (IMPROVED) Rolling upgrade and downgrade to and from Riak TS 1.3.1. [8]
 -

 … many documentation and performance improvements.
