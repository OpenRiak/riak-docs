Justin,
Thanks a ton for the quick response, that makes perfect sense. It also
explains why I've only seen this behavior in our test environment. It may
make sense to note this info in the "Replication" node of the wiki, perhaps
in the "What does N=3 really mean?" section (there's an example of a 2-node
cluster with N=3 in there). I think our case of "Let's quickly test this
thing out on more than 1 box with default config" is probably common and
this behavior could lead some to believe that Riak isn't replicating
properly.

Thanks again.

-Alan
