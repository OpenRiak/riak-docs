Hi Humberto,

Excuse the delay here - this question slipped through. Can you walk
through what you're trying to do?

When it comes to hook examples, the best examples are kept up-to-date
on this page [1]. I found one example from this blog post [2] which
you can jump to by searching the page for "% pre- and post-commit hook
functions."
