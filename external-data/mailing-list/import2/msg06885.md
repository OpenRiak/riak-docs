This is only an issue if you're using bitcask (which is the default back end 
for Riak). If you're willing to consider one of the alternative storage 
backends (LevelDB or InnoDB), then you can store as much data as you want, as 
long as you have disk space to hold it.

This sounds cumbersome.

I would too - there's no guarantee that two writes to the same collection won't 
happen enough together to cause a conflict.
