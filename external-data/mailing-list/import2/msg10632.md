Right now there's nothing purpose built that compares the operation/scaling
costs of Riak and Mango. On the anecdotal side of things, Will Moss wrote a
great email to the list a while back about what to keep in mind when making
the transition [1]. 30MM documents in Riak is trivial. The queries are
probably going to be a bit harder to translate...

That said, let's see if we can quantify this for you. A few questions:

How many docs do you expect to have in six months?
What are the queries you're doing on them?
Current total data set size?
What's the median ops/second? Max?
Read to write ratio?
Current cluster hardware specifics and cloud provider (if applicable) if
you can share.

Thanks,

Mark
