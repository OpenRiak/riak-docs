Alexander, quick question - do you have Active Anti-Entropy turned on? If
yes, check out this discussion:
http://riak-users.197444.n3.nabble.com/Active-Anti-Entropy-with-Bitcask-Key-Expiry-td4027688.html(might
shed more light on the matter).

No. You can do a streaming list keys, which is less expensive than listing
keys used to be, but I'm not sure that counts as cheap.

> how long does it take to purge old keys from the storage?
This depends on how often Bitcask merges are performed. The expired keys
are actually removed from disk when merging/compaction occurs (though until
then, they will return as not found to client requests).

> is it possible to see how many keys were expired for the last
minute/hour/day?
I don't think so - Bitcask doesn't send any notification to Riak when it
expires the keys, and I don't think it keeps any records of its own.
