Hello Riak-users,

I am currently using Riak search to do some queries, since my queries are
very simple, it should be fulfilled by secondary indexes as well.
So, my question is which one has better performance and less overhead,
let's say both can fulfill the query requirement.

Many thanks in advance.

Br,
Alex
