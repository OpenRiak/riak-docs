Thanks for the reply, which confirms what I expected.

Let me explain why I asked. I have an application that my intuition says would 
be a good match to Riak, but I don't trust my intuition since I've never used 
Riak and I'm not sure I understand all of its failure modes. One thing I'm 
trying is to work through a mental model-checking exercise—which I might 
eventually turn over to a real model checker—which is making me wonder about 
all the things that can go wrong. A failed write that is visible anyway, either 
permanently or just for a while, is just one example.

In the long run, it would be great if Riak were documented perfectly and 
completely—and other other piece of software in the world too!—but in the 
meanwhile I'm just trying to build my own mental model. I'd prefer, of course, 
a mental model that does not depend on a detailed knowledge of Riak's internal 
workings, enumberating only the preconditions and postconditions of each 
operation. We'll see how far I can get....

Cheers,
John
