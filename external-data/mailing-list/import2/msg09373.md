Riak Recap for November 15 - 24
========================

1) nlf's "simple-riak" hit 0.1.3 a few days back.

\* Code here ---> https://npmjs.org/package/simpleriak

2) Suvash Thapaliya wrote a blog post about using Vagrant and Riak.

3) RiakOn, "hosted Riak that rocks", was just announced.

4) Logstash has experimental Riak support.

\* Details here ---> http://logstash.net/docs/1.1.5/outputs/riak

5) I just stumbled onto a few blogs from deepakmdass that should be
worthwhile to some of you.

6) Gideon de Kok just released Raiku, "a non-blocking - Akka IO driven
- Riak client for Scala with a cute DSL". This looks quite useful.

\* Code here ---> https://github.com/gideondk/Raiku

7) CarrotCornCat wrote some code to make Riak usable with the
Sprockets library.
