Hi All,

I am having the data like:

R =
[<<"{\"age\": 24, \"name\": \"krishna\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 29, \"name\": \"sharat\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 25, \"name\": \"ramesh\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 28, \"name\": \"kumar\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 24, \"name\": \"gopi\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 27, \"name\": \"anil\"}">>].

How can i get the age,name value for a particular age/name.

I have tried the following but i am not sure how to get it.

28> list\_to\_tuple(R).
{<<"{\"age\": 24, \"name\": \"krishna\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 29, \"name\": \"sharat\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 25, \"name\": \"ramesh\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 28, \"name\": \"kumar\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 24, \"name\": \"gopi\"}">>,
 <<"{\"age\": 27, \"name\": \"anil\"}">>}

element(1,Tup).
<<"{\"age\": 24, \"name\": \"krishna\"}">>

.

Please suggest me how to get the age/name.
