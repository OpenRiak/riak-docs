Thank you for fast reply,

Could you please specify what do you mean by context sent by client? Do you
mean update on the existing object in database?

I see exactly that when allow\_mult=false, only the highest timestamp value
is stored.

For me the results are unexpected because the client sees inconsistent
values (not from the last write) but there are no partitions and quorum is
set to the strongest consistency configurations. In the diagram, it is
showed more clearly how shifted clocks generate inconsistent result.

Thanks,
Zuzana
