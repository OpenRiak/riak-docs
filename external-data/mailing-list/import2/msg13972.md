All released versions of Riak have allow\_mult=false for default buckets. All 
release version of Riak only have default buckets.

2.0 will have allow\_mult=true as default for typed buckets, and 
allow\_mult=false for untyped/legacy buckets.

Which pre did it change in? I don’t know. But certainly from pre20 it is the 
case. I think it would be very hard for any client to support different pre 
releases.

Why? As stated by Eric and myself, for backwards compatibility with existing 
data and clusters. But the change to `true` for typed buckets is because we 
think that is the correct way to run Riak.

It was, there is a lot of history. Originally Basho wanted allow\_mult=true, I 
think they opted for false for ease of take up/adoption, but have since 
realised that Riak is safest with allow\_mult=true. The back-and-forth in the 
press reflects I suppose the difficulty of making a decision, and also, the 
difficulty of doing the “right” thing after the “wrong” thing has been done.
