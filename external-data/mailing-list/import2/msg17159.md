Hi Magnus,

Yes, thank you. Though I'm stuck a bit. When I experienced recursive
behaviour with paginated $bucket query I tried to create Yokozuna Solr
index with an empty schema (just \_yz\_\* fields). Unfortunately querying
Yokozuna gives me inconsistent number of results as described in my another
email in this mailing list. Hopefully it will be solved as well :)
