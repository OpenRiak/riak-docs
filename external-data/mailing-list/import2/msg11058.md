I saw composer.json in riak-php-client and google'd it (never heard of it
before). Installed it and ran it and changed my require to:
require\_once('./riak-php-client/vendor/autoupdate.php');

Now I am getting this error:

 PHP Fatal error: Class 'RiakClient' not found in /root/storeinriak.php on
line 3

Digging further in I don't find any reference to RiakClient in any of the
src files, but I do find a Riak class. So I changed the source code to new
Riak('127.0.0.1'. '8098'); only to get the same error, but this time for no
Riak class.

Is this client library supported? Is anyone using it? I can't find much of
anything online when searching for any information about using this client
library. There is an example riak\_php\_app listed on the basho site from the
community, but it doesn't exist anymore on github. I found the doxygen docs
at Basho's website, but even they are out of date:
http://basho.github.io/riak-php-client/. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
coLLin
