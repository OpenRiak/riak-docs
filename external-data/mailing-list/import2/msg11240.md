Hi all,

I have a question regarding setting the n\_val.
In the documentation (
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Tunable-CAP-Controls-in-Riak/)
it is stated that:

n\_val must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the number of actual
nodes in your cluster to get all the benefits of replication.
And, we advise against modifying the n\_val of a bucket after its initial
creation as this may result in failed reads because the new
value may not be replicated to all the appropriate partitions.

But this seems contradictory to me. Which value I have to set if I'm
setting up one node right now but planning to add second one later?
Setting n\_val=2 means this value will be greater than actual number of
nodes. But setting n\_val=1 is also not advisable since
I will have to change it later to n\_val=2 (I'm planning to have two
replicas in the end).

I'm also concerned about the performance in case of one node and n\_val=2.
Will it degrade since both replicas are stored on the same server?
