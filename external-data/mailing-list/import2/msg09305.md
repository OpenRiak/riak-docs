Hi Shane,

I'm sorry for the delay on this. Over the weekend I was working to
replicate your setup so I can answer your question from experience. Alas,
time got the best of me and I have not yet finished.

That said, I'm inclined to suggest upgrading riak on your current cluster
first and then using riak-admin replace to move off of the VM's and onto
metal.

\* In this scenario, do a rolling upgrade (including making backups) of the
current cluster.
\* Install riak onto the new machines
\* join the first machine to the cluster
\* use riak-admin replace to replace one of the old nodes with the new node
\* wait for ring-ready, then repeat for the other nodes.
