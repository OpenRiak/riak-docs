That would be very cool. Can't wait for it! 

Keeping delete-by-bucket on the wish list would still be nice, I could see it 
very useful down the road as we iterate with data shapes and deal with data 
migrations.

Yea, I agree. Do you have any pointers or thoughts on conventions for 
integrating QC into a rails app? 


Since I've adopted using moonshine, I was thinking of sticking the M/R scripts 
in #{Rails.root}/app/manifests/templates/riak and then the tests in 
#{Rails.root}/qc. Then working out the devops to load the up any mr files for 
my dev/test environment.
