Hey Norman,

Your assumption is correct. In this particular situation, with regard to
the AppFog Application, you'd need to provide another facade over the Riak
Cluster in AWS that would provide security and API end point access. This
facade application, which easily could just be another node.js web service
running at AWS, would provide all access while the Riak Cluster would be
setup and allowed only internal communication with the facade layer.

Another option is to move the existing application to AWS. One good option
is to use Beanstalk for Node.js and then you can just open up internal to
AWS ports per their firewall settings to connect the Riak Cluster directly
to the actual Node.js Application. That would remove the need for a
completely autonomous service facade.

Cheers,
-Adron
