Riak-pb (https://github.com/CrowdProcess/riak-pb) is a Riak Node.js client 
module that uses Protocol Buffers (instead of HTTP) to talk to Riak. It has the 
following features:

Automatically reconnects if disconnected
Can be configured with an array of nodes, load-balancing between them
Uses connection pooling, using many connections in parallel to speed up 
concurrent requests
Automatically retries if client gets disconnected during request
Provides a streaming interface for when Riak uses streaming replies


Riak-pb is entirely written in JavaScript, using protobuf.js 
(https://npmjs.org/package/protobuf.js) to encode and decode protocol buffers.


(Because it makes use of Streams2, Riak-pb is only compatible with Node.js >= 
0.10).


Enjoy!
