Hello,

I try to use the riak search java client, specifically the Search.Builder
class, like the following

Search search = new Search.Builder("test", "\_yz\_rb:accounts AND email:" +
 [user-email]).


"[user-email]" is what user entered in the login form, my question is about
sql injection, it seems like the java search client api doesn't prevent sql
injection, are there any other api/methods that I can use to prevent this?
Thank you
