Martin,

Thank you for more information.
I found a mis-configuration of riak's app.config. The backend of riak for
Riak CS is riak\_cs\_kv\_multi\_backend (look out for \_cs\_). This is the custom
riak\_kv backend for Riak CS. The error of "s3cmd ls" was caused by this.

As for MB boundary stop, the issue https://github.com/basho/riak\_cs/issues/613
may be related. Although not direct way to treat it, some points which may help:

- As Seth said, upgrade to 1.4, which can reduce network communication
between riak nodes
- Set pb\_backlog to 256 or higher in riak\_api section of riak's app.config

Regards,
Shino
