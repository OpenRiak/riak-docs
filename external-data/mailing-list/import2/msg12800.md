Riak 2.0's search is Solr and has the same functionality as SolrCloud. As I
understand it, you'll have the same functionality available to you between
the two.

Looking at the history of the source, it looks like the current Solr
version in Riak 2.0 Search is Solr 4.4... so, no, block joins aren't there.
