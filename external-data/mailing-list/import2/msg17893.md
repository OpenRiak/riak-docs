Hello Alex,

As long as each bucket does not have its own properties but rather shares one 
or a handful of bucket types you should be fine and it wouldn't make a 
difference. 

One way to record data temporally, aka in a time series fashion, from a data 
model perspective is via a pattern called deterministic materialized keys. You 
basically record the sensor name (known id) and a base time at some granularity 
into the key name and push all data captured in that time frame into that key. 
This works well if you expect to record data at regular intervals. If, however, 
your data is sparse you'll need some additional model to know when you've 
recorded data.
