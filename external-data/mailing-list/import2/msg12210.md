I am using the lastest ubuntu deb package.....



https://localhost:8069/admin

I get page not found

The connection was reset

 The connection to the server was reset while the page was
loading.

 The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
 moments.
 If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
 connection.
 If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
 that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.



Is riak running on the port? Yup

root@ubuntu-VirtualBox:/etc/riak# lsof -i :8069
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
beam.smp 1376 riak 21u IPv4 3238716 0t0 TCP localhost:8069 (LISTEN)


I followed the instructions here
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/riak-control/

%% https is a list of IP addresses and TCP ports that the Riak
 %% HTTPS interface will bind.
 {https, [{ "127.0.0.1", 8069 }]},

 %% Set to false to disable the admin panel.
 {enabled, true},




So...what could be wrong? Yes..I restarted riak after I make the change to
the config file.

Thanks
