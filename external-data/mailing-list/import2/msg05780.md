Thanks Russel for the reply .

After going through all the APIs I too reached the same opinion. 1)Simultaneous 
multiple fetch and 2)MapReduce. However, simultaneous access would make the 
fetch very slower and it doesnt look efficient ( since there are threads 
spawned for each key and fetching say, 10K records might be an over head) let 
me know if I miss something here and that I shoudl not be concerned. My worry 
is not the procedure to spawn so many worker threads, but the number of 
connections they open and close and the performance overhead, thereby


I tried the map reduce in similar way that you mentioned. For weird reasons, it 
throws Java Heap memory exception and dies.

MapReduceResult result = client.mapReduce() .addInput("goog","2010-01-04") 
.addInput("goog","2010-01-05") .addInput("goog","2010-01-06") 
.addInput("goog","2010-01-07") .addInput("goog","2010-01-08") .addMapPhase(new 
NamedJSFunction("Riak.mapValuesJson"), true) .execute();


I used the same format as above mentioned in 
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client page. I tried with and without the 
addMapPhase method, but in vain. Am I missing something here? Is there a 
prerequisite to use this code?

I also see that the above methods works only for IRiakClient. Until now I have 
been using RiakClient. Only to access these methods. I am using IRiakClient. 
Does that have any significance? way to access/ configure IRiakClient/ 
Mapreduce. This is the only place I need the map reduce, 
and throughout my code, i just store and fetch key values.  

I dont seem to get the answers in the forums or documents. If there are any,can 
you please point? Thanks again.

May be I can make my statement clear :) I store my devices values in buckets

signature takes in bucket name and key. (Client.fetch("windows", "D1"). Is 
there a way where I can get Client.fetch("windows", ?

There is no multi-fetch from Riak right now. You can either fetch your 
individual keys (serially on in parallel) or run a Map/Reduce. In most case the 
Map/Reduce will be slower (though the API is simpler, I suppose.)

Use IRiakClient.mapReduce().addInput(bucket, key).addInput(bucket, 
key2)…(repeat!) I guess this is ripe for a convenience method that takes (as 
you suggest) addInputs(bucket, Collection keys), so I'll add that to 
the features list.

Or just fetch all your keys using fetch. 

I guess it would be possible to add a bulk fetch API to the Riak Java Client 
that spawns a configurable number of threads to fetch a bunch of keys in 
parallel, but right now that is left as an exercise for the reader :)

Cheers
