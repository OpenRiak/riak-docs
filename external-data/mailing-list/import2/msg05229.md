Use a secondary index when writing the key.

Otherwise the only date you get is last modified date as seen in the 
header. Although that date is not indexed and would only work in your 
use case if your link write was your last write to that key.


Cheerios,

Hi all,

I'm using the python bindings for Riak so there may be an element of 
this being obscured due to the library.


I'm creating a link between two objects - I can establish it, query 
it and tag it so that part is working great. What I want to do now 
is determine the date/time a link was created between the two 
objects. That way I could generate a job that says get me all the 
objects of bucket A that are linked to bucket B that were linked at 
time X (and potentially date ranging down the line as well but walk 
then run).


Is this doable? Am I looking in the wrong place by looking at the 
data available on the link itself?


Kind regards
Andrew
