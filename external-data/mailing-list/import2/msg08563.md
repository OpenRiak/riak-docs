Here are some more details about the cluster.

{ring\_creation\_size, 1024},

{default\_bucket\_props, [
 {n\_val, 2},
 {r, 1},
 {w, 1},
 {allow\_mult, false},
 {last\_write\_wins, false},
 {precommit, []},
 {postcommit, []},
 {chash\_keyfun, {riak\_core\_util, chash\_std\_keyfun}},
 {linkfun, {modfun, riak\_kv\_wm\_link\_walker, mapreduce\_linkfun}}
]},

{storage\_backend, riak\_kv\_multi\_backend},
{multi\_backend\_default, <<"store">>},
{multi\_backend, [
{<<"store">>, riak\_kv\_bitcask\_backend, [
 {data\_root, "/var/lib/riak/bitcask/store"}
]},
{<<"cache">>, riak\_kv\_bitcask\_backend, [
 {data\_root, "/var/lib/riak/bitcask/cache"},
 {expiry\_secs, 21600}
]}
]},

On using Riaknostic I am seeing these errors.

[warning] The following preflists do not satisfy the n\_val:
[[{973382926425464638881751031164555683013033197568,'riak@178.238.237.241'},.....
a big list similar to this...]

Please help. We are stuck.
