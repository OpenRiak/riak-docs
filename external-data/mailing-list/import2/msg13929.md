Are there any plans to introduce a Riak Search API that will allow a search
to return matching documents, rather than references to matching documents?
 Its seems rather cumbersome to have to generate at least two round trips,
or more, to satisfy a query.

I suppose this would also require Riak KV to implement a bulk fetch API, as
a result set may return a larger number of results.

The closest approximation to this functionality at the moment is to perform
a search using MapReduce. This has the advantage of allowing you to stream
the results, but incurs the overhead of setting up the MR job, and has an
implicit R=1 that can't be tuned.
