If I'm understanding you correctly, effectively the search results always (or 
sometimes?) reflect out-dated values.

Can you supply more details on your configuration? N/R/W values, number of 
nodes?

Does the problem persist or resolve itself eventually? Is it always true or 
only sometimes true that this occurs?

Do you have an example value (old and new) that caused you problems?
