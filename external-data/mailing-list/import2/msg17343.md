Hi all,

Imaging I have an index called "\*posts\*" where I index the following fields

 



and I reuse the index in 3 buckets: "status", "photos" and "videos"... then
I do the following:

\*results = client.fulltext\_search('posts', 'likes\_counter:[100 TO \*]',
sort='likes\_counter desc', rows=10)\*

This query would give me the top10 most liked items (can be statuses,
photos or videos) with at least 100 likes. But how could I limit the
resultset to only the "photos" bucket?? The goal is to get the Top10 liked
photos without creating an index for itself... as is good to also be able
to query the top10 items in general. Any way to do it?

In another hand... does somebody know how to do the same query but without
the [100 TO \*]?? I leave it empty?

\*results = client.fulltext\_search('\*\*posts\*\*', '', sort='likes\_counter
desc', rows=10)\*

Thanks,
Alex
