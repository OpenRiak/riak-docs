Hello Luke, I've come to have new questions about RIAK. I have the 3-node
cluster up and running, I have stored some data in the cluster using a
Bucket called "Productos". In that bucket, I have stored java objects of a
class "Product", which has the following attributes: ID,Name,Description,
Price,Vendor,ImgURL. I have stored them using the
"Mybucket".store(Product.ID,Product).execute(); instruction. I've come to
the point where I want to apply some madreduce to determine what words are
the most used for the description attribute of each product, I've seen
examples of mapreduce but they haven't help a lot. Any clue?
