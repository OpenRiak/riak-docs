Another issue we've run into is that the Erlang native client allows
you to store non-binary values, which can not be accessed from the
PBC.... so if you're not careful or don't know better, you'll be in
for some migration if you're trying to use other clients.

The only real problem is that the PBC needs some additional software
around it to pool connections, where the Erlang native client got that
for free because it was leveraging Erlang distribution.
