Hi, John.

Riak doesn't itself mandate a maximum object size... but since a
riak\_object in transit must be materialized into an in-memory data
structure and copied across processes, large objects can cause very
poor performance or failure. The exact practical maximum can vary a
bit.

There is some (prototyped but not yet fully integrated) work that,
when released, will allow you to store large objects easily by
transparently chunking them into a hash tree of smaller objects. More
details on this when it lands.

I hope that this information is helpful.

Best,

-Justin
