Hi Mark,

Thanks for the clear explanation. The EOL life announcement for Luwak
came as a surprise to me, and frankly, was a letdown. But I understood
because I, probably like several others on the list, thought it would
be replaced with something equally simple to use and maintain.

Yes, the distributed systems model and powerful query engine is part
of why I chose Riak for my application - but Luwak was a big influence
as well. And while I understand Basho needs to turn a profit on their
products (and software development is expensive), I also feel somewhat
baited - that the product I had planned to use was killed, and it's
replacement will be commercially released instead. I doubt I'm the
only one who feels this way.

Do you think something could be worked out for people in my situation
- who are bootstrapping and could use the technology? If so, let's
talk off list.
