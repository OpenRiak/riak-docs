You can also add in that Riak is, by default, going to pull back the freshly 
written copy of the data from disk. You can disable this behavior by setting 
ReturnBody to false. Disabling this is great for bulk data loads.

Consumer hard drives just plain suck for performance. You're going to be 
limited by tiny caches, slow rotational speeds, and (unless you have newish 
gear) a slower I/O backplane. Since you probably can't change your hardware 
quickly, look at other things.

My guess is that your read/write pattern is skewing your performance 
tremendously. Hints for performance: 
If you must read where you write, read memory. If it won't fit into memory, 
buffer it in chunks. 
Multi-thread for performance. 
Avoid HTTP like the plague (use protocol buffers instead). 
Use the fastest gear money can buy - Riak is going to be heavily disk I/O bound 
so tune your storage appropriately. If you can't afford SSD, try 15k SAS 
drives. If you can't afford or use 15k SAS drives, use a buttload of 10k drives 
in RAID 10 with a hardware controller. If you can't use hardware RAID, don't 
RAID.
