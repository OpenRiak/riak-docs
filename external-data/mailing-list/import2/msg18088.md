Hi Jurgen,

I am not sure what causes this issue on your machine, but it may be due to
a copy and paste error. Please try putting the entire command onto one line
in the shell, like this:

curl -XPUT http://localhost:8098/types/default/buckets/test/keys/test -H
"Content-Type: text/plain" -d "hello"

Please ensure that all nodes in the cluster are up. Before a bucket type
can be activated, it must have been distributed to all nodes.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
