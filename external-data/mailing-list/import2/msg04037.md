Good to hear that the package arrived safely. (I think what I'm most pleased
about is that you were able to decipher my handwriting on the note.)

Read the TOS on that t-shirt carefully, btw. By accepting the delivery, you
agree to wear it every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and are required to
wear it to any technical talks/presentations where your coworkers/colleagues
happen to be presenting on non-Riak data storage technologies. :)

Enjoy.

Mark
