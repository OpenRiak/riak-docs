It's been a long time coming but we've finally released the Chef
cookbook[1] with support for Riak 2.0 (2.0.1). The cookbook can be grabbed
by its git tag [2] or from Chef's Supermarket site [3].

If you're still on Riak 1.x, we also have an update [4] and have cut a
branch for any continuing 1.4.x based releases [5].

Feedback, bug reports, and pull requests are always welcome.

Cheers,

Seth Thomas
