Riak Recap for Jan. 5 - 6

1) Scott Likens updated the Engine Yard AppClound Cookbooks for Riak 0.14

Repo here ---> https://github.com/damm/ey-riak

Thanks, Scott.

2) For all the Node.js fans out there:

 \* Francisco Treacy pushed an updated version of riak-js. Details
here---> http://twitter.com/frank06/status/23049632342867968

 \* Sean Cribbs is looking for comments on https://gist.github.com/769841

3) On the heels of the 0.14 release, we posted some more info on the
Basho Blog about the new M/R enhancements.

4) The first of many "Minute with Riak" podcasts was posted today.
This one features Basho hacker Rusty Klophaus talking about Riak's
backend options.

Listen here ---> http://riak.minutewith.com/pages/20110104

\*\* Also, if you have any thoughts on what you might want to hear for
future "Minute with Riak" Episodes, don't hesitate to email
ru...@basho.com.

5) seancribbs and oal had a very short chat in #riak that started with
"Maybe this is a stupid question, but how does Riak's links perform
compared to mysql foreignkeys/joins?"

6) Q --- Do you know when key filter support will be available in the
python client? (from gordyt via #riak)
 
 A --- Josip has it working in his fork. We'll be working on
integrating his pull request into master over the next few days.
(https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/pull/6)
 
7) Q --- I'm attempting to write my own vnode behavior, and I'm using
riak\_kv\_vnode as a guide and I was curious if there's any reason I
shouldn't build my preflist inside my API function (versus externally
like riak\_kv does) (from progski via #riak)

 A --- You can definitely take that approach. Just make sure to
construct a proper #sender{} record (see riak\_core\_vnode.hrl) ....

8) Q --- Is it possible to log to syslog from riak without another
tool? (from portertech via #riak)

 A --- At the moment there is no support for this built into Riak.

9) Jon Brisbin wrote a JAR file PUTer/ClassLoader to store class files in Riak.
