riak-users,

Adding to the existing list of RFCs for the next release of Riak, Andrew
Thompson and I would like to get your feedback on a significant change to
Riak's key structure:

https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/362

This has an effect on third-party client developers, especially, since it
introduces several new APIs. We would really like to hear from you.

Like the other RFCs, please comment on the Github issue.

Cheers,
Jordan
