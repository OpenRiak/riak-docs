Hi,

Assuming I'm understanding your use case correctly, the first option seems
like your best bet.

Primary key lookups are where Riak really shines, and if you're only
GET-ing one key and then manipulating the associated json-dict with some
app code, things should perform quite well (assuming your objects aren't
huge).

Does that make sense? Or did I misunderstand things?
