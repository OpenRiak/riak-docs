Satish,

I see you are doing a disjunction search across the type field `(type:image
type:video type:FacebookPost)`. How many documents match that sub-query? If
it is over 100k then legacy Riak Search will fail to return on the query
causing it to timeout. In general, legacy Riak Search has issues with
larger result sets. In 2.0 there is a new version of Riak Search (code name
Yokozuna) which should have much less issues with larger result sets. You
can try playing with it via the 2.0.0pre11 download.
