Hi Riak users,

we are using the Riak Java client and need to support high availability

Currently I am connection the pbc to a specific node in our cluster,

I would like to pass a list of IP's so that in case the connect fails on
one we will try the operation again on the other node (Also that way the
work distribution is shared by all the nodes on the cluster)

Thanks,

Shimon
