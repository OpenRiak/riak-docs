busy\_dist\_ports usually means that you're trying to push too much data
over your connections, but there are also other things that can
trigger it.

you can tune the amount of buffer that distributed erlang provides by adding
+zdbbl 

where  is the buffer size \*in KB\* \*per other node in the
cluster\*. the default is 1024 (i.e. one megabyte), but raising it to
8 or 16MB is often called for in busy clusters. If that doesn't help,
you may be affected by one of the other issues that I mentioned. That
said, I am not sure that this will help handoff, as it does not go
over distributed erlang.
