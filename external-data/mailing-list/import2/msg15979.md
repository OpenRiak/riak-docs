You do not have to set up Yokozuna (yz) to be able to use counters, sets, maps 
in Riak. Those types can be used independently via the Riak key value store. 
You only need to set up the indexes if you were to search for data via yz or 
search 2.0. And in that case, you can remove the generic mappings, keep the \_yz 
specific ones and then explicitly add the fields you want to index/search on.

Hi all,

To be able to use counters/sets/maps in Riak I have to store the object into a 
defined bucket\_type indexed via SOLR.

However, this will require extra disk space as data will be indexed (if using 
the default schema). Can I create a custom schema "ignoring" all fields so 
nothing is indexed? I don't need to use Riak Search on these objects, as I 
always know the KEY to fetch them. A schema like this would work? ( I guess 
that I can not put [ indexed="false" ] in the "\_yz\*" fields required by Riak, 
right? Or is it possible to not index that data either? )

Another question, can I use the [ compressed="true" ] to save disk space? in 
both  and "\_yz\*" fields?

Thanks,
Alex
