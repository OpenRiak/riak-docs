hiredis has a model for pluggable event loops in a C client lib that may be 
worth having a look at. i've integrated it into a C server that was already 
using a libevent loop and it worked very well.

https://github.com/redis/hiredis

but more importantly thanks for all the effort on a C lib! sometimes it feels 
like those of us who still use C are forgotten :)

cheers,
rob.
