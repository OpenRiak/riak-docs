Sorry, still running into issues.

So I've disabled cache on all solr nodes, but the yokozuna query times are 
still high.

Oddly, running queries against any one node completes in a few ms. So I 
injected nginx between riak and solr so I could log queries, and now I'm even 
more confused.

There is 5 requests to each solr node for every request to yokozuna.

These are the nginx logs for one Solr node. The log format is apache combined, 
plus the total query time, and a dump of the POST body.

These queries look fine, they are from localhost, but over the internal IP 
address, and they all complete in under 10ms. The return the exact same body 
length, so I'm confused why it's run 3 times, but not much of a performance 
concern.

This is where I start getting worried, the query is now changed to \*:\* instead 
of the one I passed to yokozuna, and rows=0. Not surprisingly, this takes 
almost 2 seconds since it has to count a massive amount of documents.

This is a similar query as the previous one, but this one is from localhost 
(not the private IP) and the output format is json, not javabin. It's also 
missing the usual Solr user agent. This is still a \*:\* query requesting 0 rows 
though, and also takes almost 2 seconds.

Now I'm not sure these last 2 queries are actually required to complete the 
yokozuna request, but they are run every time I make a new request. Although 
each of these queries takes over 1.8 seconds, the yokozuna request completed in 
1.2 seconds. However, if it was only waiting on the shorter requests, even 
1.2s seconds is much too long.

Can anyone give insight into what yokozuna is doing here and hopefully a way to 
make it as fast as the underlying solr queries (>10ms)?

Still confused,
Jason
