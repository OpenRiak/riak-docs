Hi, I'm a riak newbie and I'm planning to use it for my next project.
It would be very useful to have a way to see inside buckets graphically
(like phpmyadmin), a project similar to riak-control but for data.
Does anybody know of something like this? Something basic is ok, I don't
need anything fancy.

TIA,
 ngw
