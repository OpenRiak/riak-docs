It has been done before. there are various results when searching
"riak haproxy" in your favourite search engine.

If your load balancer falls over, what do you do then? Highly
available may go down the pan. Have more than one would be the obvious
answer.

What do you do when you want to transparently add more machines to
your load balancer?

Maybe it might be better to have a list of riak nodes stored in a
separate registry (I'm thinking something like zookeeper), that your
application servers can then poll for changes (or even subscribe to
changes) to the list of servers.
