Brian,

Thanks for the response, and sorry I couldn't get back to you before this.
I had to change focus to a couple of other projects before I could come
back to my Riak project.

We've solved our problem. Basically, we had to wrap the Riak.mapValuesJson
so that the pertinent part of the map looks like this:

var dats = JSON.parse(Riak.mapValuesJson(value)[0])

I was under the assumption that Riak.mapValuesJson turned the data into a
JSON object, but that wasn't the case for us. Wrapping in a JSON.parse
gives us a JSON object, just like we had originally stored, and lets us use
dot access on the hash.

Thanks again for your response, it helped me to recognize where we went
wrong. We were getting back what LOOKED like expected results, just in a
string format instead of JSON.

Thanks,
Brad
