One more thing...

Our new product, the Basho Data Platform (BDP), had its 1.0.0 released
on Aug 27, 2015. BDP combines the power of Riak KV with pre-integrated
connections into Apache Spark and Redis, making it much simpler to
develop and deploy distributed applications. For more information,
explore the product page [1], blog post [2] or the documentation [3].

We also released an open source Spark Connector, that leverages an
updated 2i query for parallel extract from BDP [4].

Jump in, use the systems and open pull requests! You can spin it up
using Vagrant here [5].

Share and enjoy,
Matt
