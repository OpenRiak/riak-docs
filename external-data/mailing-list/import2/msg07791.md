Hey all,

Question about EC2 (or scale in general): i'm building a decent cluster,
to handle 15-20k inserts/s and 5-10k gets per second. (for a rough idea
of what I'm doing). I've been playing with a 15-node cluster of
m2.xlarge systems, but I am wondering what is better: more small systems
or less larger systems?

Any recommendations/hints/tricks would be a huge help!


Your cheapest/fastest option is probably physical HW with SSDs.
