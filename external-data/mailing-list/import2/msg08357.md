Mark,

This email slipped through the cracks but Mark Phillips kindly brought it
to my attention. The uninstall command works just fine for me against
master. What version of Riak are you running?

Lightbulb...have you by any chance upgraded from older versions over time?
 If so can you show me the JSON returned for a bucket that you've had
enabled since \_before\_ upgrading to 1.0.0? Or could you just humor me and
look at the JSON for all your search enabled buckets and see if you have a
"search":true attribute?
