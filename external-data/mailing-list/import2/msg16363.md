Hello all, I have a 5 node riak cluster, all nodes running 1.4.2.

I want to upgrade to riak 2.x

According to this:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/upgrading/rolling-upgrades/ I can
perform a rolling upgrade (a mixed cluster)
as long as the versions aren't more than 2 versions apart.

There is no riak 1.5 so would riak 1.4.2 -> 2.0.5 count as 1 version apart?

Sujay
