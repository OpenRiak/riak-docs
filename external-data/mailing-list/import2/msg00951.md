Riak Recap for 8/23 - 8/24

1) @benblack will be giving a talk on Riak at the Seattle High
Scalability User Group tonight.

Details here ---> http://bit.ly/crtq68

2) @freshtonic recently spearheaded a hacknight Down Under and put
together some great sample code that might come in handy for anyone
who wants a pre-packaged way to abuse Riak's MapReduce.

Github repo here ---> http://github.com/freshtonic/hacknightcodewars2

3) It was just announced that Sean Cribbs is talking at the Kansas
City Ruby Meetup. This one isn't happening until Sept. 14th, but book
your plane tickets and mark your calendars now.

Details and registration here --->

4) @sfalcon tweeted -- http://twitter.com/sfalcon/status/22026605688
-- about using http://github.com/micha/jsawk to clear out buckets in
Riak using curl. That might be a good project to check out for those
of you who are testing Riak.

5) wiki.basho.com was down for about about five minutes on Monday. We
did an extensive post mortem on the incident and here is what we
concluded ---> http://twitter.com/basho/status/21931765729

6) Q --- Glad to hear about the new fold\_keys operation in bitcask.
Is this the best way to implement a count\_keys operation? (from mietek
via #riak)

 A --- Yes.

7) trackback() and benblack had a brief and general conversation about
Riak that started with "Any information on how riak rebalances?"
