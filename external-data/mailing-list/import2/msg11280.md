Hi Everyone , 


At 1st i want to say , Riak is a amazing project and i love open source . 


I was searching some kind of storage api to make attached files cross apps and 
found Riak . 


In the other way i need full text search too. 


So Riak looks like to fits perfectly . 


But i have one question : 


What is the best way to store " searchable PDFs " in Riak and allow full - text 
- search . Will i need to extract the text from PDFs in my Ruby App and store 
the text in Riak too? 


Looks like i need to have one bucket with the PDFs files and other with the 
same key but in clear text . Am i right ? 


Would be perfect is could be possible just search directly in the PDFs files, 
natively or using some kind of plugin . 


Tks .
