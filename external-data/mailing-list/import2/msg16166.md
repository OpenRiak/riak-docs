Hey Damien, 




I followed up internally and had Brian Sparrow share the details: 





This is just saying that an operation took longer than a configurable 
threshold. It can safely be ignored. I believe the default threshold is 1ms. 
Looks like this was disabled in earlier versions but was re-enabled in vm 
settings in 2.1.

Cheers,

Hi,



In a cluster with 27 nodes, running 2.0.0, I upgraded one node to 2.1.1

(riak-2.1.1-1.el6.x86\_64.rpm). Since them, this node is producing these

kind of logs, every couple of minutes:



2015-05-27 14:56:31.978 [info]

<0.94.0>@riak\_core\_sysmon\_handler:handle\_event:92 monitor long\_schedule

<0.1201.0>

[{initial\_call,{riak\_core\_vnode,init,1}},{almost\_current\_function,{gen,do\_call,4}},{message\_queue\_len,1}]

[{timeout,1329},{in,{gen,do\_call,4}},{out,{gen,do\_call,4}}]





Any idea what this is and if it's harmful? I'd like to double check

before upgrading the other nodes



Thanks

dams.
