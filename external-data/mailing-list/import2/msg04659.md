Joe,

Thanks for the explanation it's super helpful. Everything made complete
sense, but I wanted to double check my understanding on one paragraph:

Given how 0.14.2 would immediately reassign partition ownership
> before actually transferring the data, it was entirely possible to have 2
> or more replicas temporarily in the not\_found state even if there was actual
> data for the item somewhere in the cluster (the old partition owner).


Let's say I have N=3, R=2. Is the situation in the above paragraph possible
because hypothetically the new node joining the ring could claim 2 of the 3
vnodes that hold replicas of a certain document? So when I do a read with a
R=2, 2 of the 3 replicas are now in vnodes claimed by new physical node but
it doesn't have the data yet, so my read fails?
