Joe, thanks for the information.

Will Riak detect a LevelDB that was not cleanly shutdown when it starts up
and start repair on its own?

If not, will Basho add a command to riak-admin to make it easy to repair
LevelDB backends while restoring them?

Any comments on the backup strategy for Yokozuna? Will it make use of
Solr's Replication Handler, or something more lower level? Will the node
need to be offline to backup it up?

Ryan Zezeski any thoughts?
