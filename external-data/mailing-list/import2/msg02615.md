sure, i'm not confusing with MD5, this algorithm is a joke to use as a secure 
hashing mechanism, too many collisions.
about SHA-1... from wikipedia: "A 2008 attack by StÃ©phane Manuel breaks the 
hash function, as it can produce hash collisions with a complexity of 251 
operations", so, even hard, collisions are possible.
either way, glad to know the random id in Riak is fairly trustful, no more 
questions then : ) thanks
