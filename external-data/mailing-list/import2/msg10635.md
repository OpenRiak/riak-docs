Hi Evan,

Thanks for the suggestions!

I did not think that raising that limit was normal. Glad to have confirmation.

I'll go through the logs again, and run 'riak-admin top ...' the next time it 
happens.

Dave,

If you're seeing the process count go that high, it suggests to me
that something else is wrong. Typically, even for heavily loaded
clusters, hundreds of thousands of processes isn't normal. Is there
anything else in the logs?

When a node sees this sort of behavior start, does riak-admin top
-sort msg\_q look like?
