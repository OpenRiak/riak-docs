Hi,

We are running a cluster of 5 servers, or at least trying to, because nodes
seem to be dying 'randomly'
without us knowing any reason why. We don't have a great Erlang guy aboard,
and the error logs are not
that verbose.
So I've just .tgz the whole log directory and I was hoping somebody could
give us a clue.
It's there: https://www.dropbox.com/s/z9ezv0qlxgfhcyq/riak-died.tar.gz(might
not be fully uploaded to dropbox yet!)

I've looked at the archive and some people said their server was dying
because some object's size was just
too big to allocate the whole memory. Maybe that's what we're seeing?

As one of our buckets is set with allow\_mult, I am tempted to think that
some object's size may be exploding.
However, we do actually try to resolve conflicts in our code. Any idea how
to confirm and then debug that we
have an issue there?


Thanks a lot for your precious help...

Julien
