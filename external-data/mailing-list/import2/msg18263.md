Hi,
I have a 3 node riak cluster, with ring\_size=64, n\_val=2.
when I run benchmark using basho\_bench, my initial results are about 12k
ops but it drops very much.
during this time, riak write rate on my disk is about 200 ops; so it's seem
logical to see performance drop after some time. but I can't increase this
number by changing vm.dirty\_background\_bytes and vm.dirty\_bytes.

what should I do to resolve this performance issue, and get steady results?
