The client might not support that, I don't know. I know the Python client (at 
least the version I'm using) also does a full GET of the object.

Here's the kicker though, I'm using LevelDB for the backend and LevelDB is 
notorious for having poor read performance when you're trying to GET a key that 
doesn't exist (checking for existence). So, don't do it if you're using LevelDB.

Bitcask is another story though, since all the keys are in memory so that 
lookup is constant time (I believe, unless your key space is going into swap, 
but that shouldn't happen).
