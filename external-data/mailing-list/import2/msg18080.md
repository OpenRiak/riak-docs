Hello,

I have two questions :

Problem with Riak KV installation Bitcask. I try this link to install
Bitcask on Riak KV:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.0/setup/planning/backend/bitcask/

And when I go on step
Bitcask Database Files


I try to do this command :
curl -XPUT http://localhost:8098/types/default/buckets/test/keys/test \
-H "Content-Type: text/plain" \ -d "hello

I receive this error :

\*curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host ' -H'\*
\*curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'Content-Type: text'\*
\*curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host ' -d'\*
\*curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'hello'\*
