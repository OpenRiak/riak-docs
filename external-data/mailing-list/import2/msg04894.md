 Hi,

I've got my riak ring in a state where streaming keys or curling a bucket with 
?keys = true returns a whole bunch of keys of deleted objects.

Since this is test data, I'm going to go ahead and blow away the bitcask 
folders and start over, but I'm wondering if anybody could shed some light on 
how I might have gotten into this state and how I can get out.
