Exactly, SQL injection happens because people construct SQL statements 
themselves and aren’t aware of correct escaping edge cases. Use a library to 
convert between Ruby and JSON, and you’ll be fine on that front. The same 
applies to SQL really. SQL injection is impossible if you pass Ruby objects 
directly into an SQL library and let it escape them.

Security as a topic is much too large to cover in a mailing list, but the same 
principle applies. Use proven libraries, and don’t try to do too much security 
yourself. It’s hard, and you will most likely get it wrong. Especially crypto.

Specific to Riak though, ensure you lock it down. It applies to any database 
really, but if you can, remove any direct internet access from the boxes, 
firewall every port you can. If you are using protocol buffers, you can 
disable HTTP access as well, it makes it a bit harder for an attacker. Run 
Riak on a non-standard port, firewall communication between the Riak nodes. 
Riak can also use a TLS certificate to encrypt handoff traffic which can 
prevent data interception between Riak nodes.

That is by no means a complete list, but a starting point at least. Security 
is a mindset, remove anything you don’t need, because the more tools you give 
an attacker, the worse things get, even if you think they are harmless.

Hope that helps,
Jason
