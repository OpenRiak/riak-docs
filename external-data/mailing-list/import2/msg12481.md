Thanks for looking into this!

Same machine:

escorpiao:programming\_in\_c seawolf$ date
Thu Oct 3 10:22:31 BNT 2013
escorpiao:programming\_in\_c seawolf$ erl
Erlang R16B01 (erts-5.10.2) [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10] 
[hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]

Eshell V5.10.2 (abort with ^G)
1> erlang:localtime\_to\_universaltime({{2013,9,28},{8,0,35}}, true).
{{2013,9,28},{0,0,35}}
2> q().
ok
escorpiao:programming\_in\_c seawolf$ 

How do I know for sure that I'm using the same Erlang binary as Riak is? I 
installed it via Homebrew and don't know off the top of my head how to verify 
which Erlang it's picking up (or if I even have more than one).
