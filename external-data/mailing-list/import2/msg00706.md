Yes, protobuffs is the fastest interface, but you can also use Python (for 
which the PBC was originally written), Java, or Ruby.

Python: http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-python-client/src
Java: http://github.com/krestenkrab/riak-java-pb-client/
Ruby: http://github.com/aitrus/riak-pbclient

More officially supported clients will be getting the PBC option in the near 
future.
