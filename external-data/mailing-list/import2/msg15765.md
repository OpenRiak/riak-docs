You certainly can with some careful tuning.

However, if Riak is being used for heavy traffic loads, youâ€™ll likely see poor 
performance as a consequence. Those large objects effectively clog the pipes 
temporarily.

Hopefully someone can chime in with tuning recommendations, but make certain 
allow\_mult is set to false; if those images end up with siblings, things can 
get very ugly.

We generally recommend Riak CS to manage the chunking of data into Riak to 
store large objects.
