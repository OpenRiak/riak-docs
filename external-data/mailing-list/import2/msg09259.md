Ok so i went through with a quick find replace updated the filenames and
references afew days ago. Didn't get a chance to finish building the doc
files but the tests passed and was able to use riak locally without issue.

Gonna look around and see how bashos done sphinx integration since this
change is mostly to avoid confusing new adopters.

The changes are here, I'll rebase at the end for a clean pull request:
