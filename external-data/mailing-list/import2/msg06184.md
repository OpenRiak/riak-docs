Thanks Jared.

i ran the make clean command as you said, and it  did work. but then it didnt 
create the dev directory. I am only familiar with the instructions on how to 
run a three node cluster ( dev1, 2 and 3) riak . I tried doing made devrel and 
I get this error below.

I already set a three node cluster on my desktop, where i have configured and 
was working. Now since I moved to the laptop I am unable to start the Riak and 
there by do any changes for my project. Even if someone directs me on how to 
set a riak up and fine, it would be good. The only instruction seems to be to 
make it from the source which is not working in my case.

Thanks
Suresh Chandran

Try cleaning out the directory with a 
'make clean distclean pkgclean'

The regex to set the supported erlang version is in the rebar.config file if 
you do want to change that.

And build again.
