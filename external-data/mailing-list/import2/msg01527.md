So if the relevant data isn't read in a while and two more nodes go down (with 
an n\_val of 3), there is a chance that some data is lost.

Ah, if the partition ownership changes, the data should get relocated straight 
away.
I had gossip put down only for immediate topology changes (which worked fine in 
my case, it just never got around to redistributing the data).

This sounds less confidence inspiring. On the off-chance that the node (or 
hardware) crashes between telling a node to leave the ring and the data handoff 
having been completed, you'll have more work on your hands than just restarting 
the node, and you have to know about this as well. This isn't a scenario that 
will happen often, but from the point of view of someone who wants the least 
amount of manual intervention when something goes wrong, I'd prefer resilience 
over performance.

A was up and responsive the entire time. No swapping; the machines don't have 
any swap space configured. However, they were rather weak in the IO department, 
so the load did rise to 10 and above on bulk inserts, and to around 6 during 
the handoffs IIRC (on a two core machine). One of the reasons I wanted to check 
things out on instances with more IO performance.

Which means that I shouldn't just wait for riak-admin ringready to return TRUE, 
but for the data handoffs to have completed as well before changing the network 
topology again?

Thanks for your answers, they have been enlightening.
