Hi,
 I have configured Riak to store sessions in a separate bitcask backend
which has an expiration set. What I observe though is that when all
sessions are expired (overnight), the properties I set on the bucket revert
to the default bucket properties. Is there a way to make these bucket
properties permanent without making them the default for the entire cluster?

Regards
