Hi Team,

I am using older version of riak and I have deleted keys from riak but when
I list down keys from bucket, it shows me deleted keys also.

I want to reclaim disk space occupied by only \*deleted keys\*.

I am planning to add \*dead\_bytes\_merge\_trigger \*setting in\* app.config \*
file.

1. Will this work ?
2. In Bitcask document
http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.2.1/tutorials/choosing-a-backend/Bitcask/
under section "\*Disk-Usage and Merging Settings\*"

"The merge process is affected by the settings described below. In the
discussion, “dead” refers to \*keys that are no longer the latest value \*or
those that have been deleted; “live” refers to keys that are the newest
value and have not been deleted."

what is meaning of "\*keys that are no longer the latest value\*" ?

thanks,
Sohil
