Maybe slightly a different topic, but it's always seemed a little strange to me 
that bucket names are prefixed to every key in the keydir -- or rather, they 
are part of the key at that layer. Wouldn't it be the common case that there 
are relatively few buckets? And so wouldn't it save a lot of memory to keep a 
reference to an interned bucket name string in each entry, instead of the whole 
bucket name?

This seems like it would only be more expensive (in terms of memory usage) if 
either a) your bucket names are very short, like fewer than 4 bytes, or b) your 
ratio of keys to buckets is near 1.

I'm sure I am missing something, though, and haven't poked into that part of 
the code yet.
