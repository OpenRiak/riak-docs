I was able to achieve similar results. I wrote a Ruby process that would
keep at most n (I think n = 10) things at once and reached 2,500ish req/s
on my macbook pro.

I loaded data to a cluster of six Riak nodes by running several of these
processes at once and attaching each to a different Riak node, and I hit
18,000 req/s. I'm not sure whether loading different nodes affected the
speed or not, now that I think of it.
