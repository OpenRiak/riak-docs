Hi All

With Basho going into bankruptcy, the domain basho.com is an asset which 
is up for sale. This email list is hosted on the basho.com domain so 
may stop working unexpectedly in the future.


We've set up an alternative email group on Google at 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/riak-users


There's a similar issue with docs.basho.com which we hope to find a 
solution for.


Steve
