I've spent a while trying to write a script to replicate this problem but so 
far I've been unsuccessful. I'll try to keep an eye out to see if I can spot 
patterns for when this happens but otherwise I'll probably need to drop this 
problem for a little while. 

If anybody has ideas on additional things I can try to check to isolate the 
cause of these 400 errors I'd be happy to give it a try. Just in case it 
sparks ideas for possible causes below is a bit more information about our test 
suite/environment: 
Heavy use of leveldb storage backend and secondary index queries.
Both javascript and erlang map reduce functions are used.
The error has been observed with Riak 1.1.2 running on both OS X 10.7.3 
installed via homebrew and on ubuntu 11.04 installed via the package based chef 
cookbook.
The OS X system has a single riak instance running, the linux based system is a 
3 node cluster running on 3 EC2 instances.
The app.config being used can be found at 
https://gist.github.com/83b59b51b94b38e451b0

Thanks again for the quick response!
