Darshan,

I think you are going to be too resource constrained to do anything
effective. We do have a demo set-up of a 5 node Riak cluster running on
Raspberry Pis, but they have 1 GB RAM each.

I know there is a board that boots straight to Erlang from Siemens grisp.org
- I saw it demo'd at EUC in Stockholm last year, but currently it only has
64MB of RAM. The designer was talking about the next generation having 1GB
RAM but I am not sure when that will be available.
