I think I faced a similar problem a while back.
To resolve this, I create a temporary dictionary and set the key, value
like this:

var res={};
res[key] = value;
return [res];

Using something like var res={key:value}; also did not work, as far as I
remember.

Maybe others could shed some light on this.
