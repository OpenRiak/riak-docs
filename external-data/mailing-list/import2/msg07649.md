Trevor,

I don't have a FC 17 VM handy, so I can't test it, but have you tried the FC 15 
package from http://basho.com/resources/downloads/? The only problem I could 
see you having is a wrong dependency on openssl, but you should be able to 
install the matching one along side the one that installs with FC 17.

The proper erlang is bundled in the Riak packages, so you won't need Erlang 
installed otherwise. Let me know either way if it works.

-Jared
