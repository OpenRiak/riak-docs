Hi Brad!

You're most of the way there. The access key and the secret key go into the
riak-cs.conf file (usually located in /etc/riak-cs/ ). And you get them
from creating an admin user. (And then copy & paste them into the config
file).

http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/configuration/Configuring-Riak-CS/#Specifying-the-Admin-User
walks you through the steps. (You can create an admin user using a curl
HTTP call, from the command line). The JSON response to issuing that http
command will contain the key id and key secret.

After creating the admin user and recording those keys in the config,
there's a few more steps to take, to configure Riak for use with S2:

Let us know if you have more questions.
