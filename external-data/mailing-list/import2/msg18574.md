Hello,

I'm trying to understand what is the plan for official riak releases
and where to find packages.

In the 2.2.6 announcement, Nicholas Adams provided
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.2/2.2.6/ as the location for binary
packages. Is this correct? Is there a plan to publish packages on
packagecloud again?

Thanks and regards,
Hank
