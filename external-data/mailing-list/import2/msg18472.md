Hi,

TL:DR - https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak/tree/rdb/nhs-riak-2.2.5 is the 
fork/branch that I’ve been making progress on.

The fork I’ve been working off is https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak. The branch 
that one should be able to build is nhs-riak-2.2.5 
(https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak/tree/rdb/nhs-riak-2.2.5). Cloning 
https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak.git and then `git checkout nhs-riak-2.2.5` and 
then `make test` should work. Though I have one or two test failures still on 
linux (not on OS X afaict.)

Each of the deps that I had to change in order to get the build working is also 
forked in the https://github.com/nhs-riak/ organisation. Each dependancy's 
branch is named after the last released tag + “nhs-2.2.5”. For example, 
https://github.com/nhs-riak/riak\_kv has branch 2.1.7-nhs-2.2.5 (since 2.1.7 was 
the last released tag.) When it all works the plan was to push each new branch 
to the canonical basho organisation and name it develop-2.2.5 (or something) 
and from there we can work towards the next release (and the one after, maybe a 
develop-3.0 branch based off 2.2.5.) We also sidestep the issue of reviewing 
and fixing up all of the basho unreleased dev code, which we can cherry-pick as 
we need.

I don’t know if this is the best idea, but it seems like a pragmatic approach 
to building momentum and getting something of value released, as well as 
setting us up for longer term improvements.

It is sort of what we agreed at the meet-up, but I’d love to hear views from 
the wider community.

Cheers

Russell
