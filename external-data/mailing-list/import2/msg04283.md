Oooh, loaded question :)

It depends on how you architect your data storage in one of the "other" tools 
that I mentioned. You could feasibly structure your data the same way you're 
structuring it in Riak: key + opaque binary value. Doing that eliminates a lot 
of the requirement for human intervention in schema changes.

If you're looking into scalability, there's enough on that front to write a 
book about, and many people have. I'll leave that as an exercise for the 
reader. But, no, it's not as easy as racking another server and saying "join 
this cluster". Depending on the solution you choose, it can be close, though.
