Hi Richard,

Yes, sharing a riak-erlang-client connection process among multiple Erlang
processes should not cause any problems. The riak\_pb\_socket processes are
implemented using a gen\_server, and they use a queuing mechanism to handle
concurrent requests. If process A has sent a request and is waiting for a
response, and process B tries to send a request using the same connection
process, its request will get queued up and will be sent once process A's
request gets a reply.

Keep in mind though that this queuing mechanism could cause suboptimal
performance if you have many processes competing for use of a single
connection: users of the connection may end up spending a lot of time
blocked, waiting for requests from other processes to finish. Depending on
the circumstances, you may find that it's better to open multiple
connections than to share a single connection among multiple processes.

Nick
