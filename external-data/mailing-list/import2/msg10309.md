Howdy,

The first Leeds Riak meet-up of 2013 will be on the 26th of March at 18.15.

This time we're holding it at the Round Foundry Media Centre, just
behind the city centre train station.

The main talk is from Martin Sumner, of the NHS's Connecting for
Health team, and his talk is called, "Riak and the big NHS Computer
System".

There'll also be a Riak 1.3 overview, food and drinks.
