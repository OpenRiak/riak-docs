Not at all surprised that the patch can't be used as-is at this point.
 I haven't had time to dig back into the riak source code, so don't
have a sense of what's needed.

I'd be most happy if someone wanted to pick this up and adjust as
needed. I'm a bit reluctant to put in more effort at this point since
previous efforts got lost in the shuffle. Is there consensus at this
point that this is a useful feature?
