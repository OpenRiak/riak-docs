Hello Everyone,

I am trying to use a strongly consistent bucket and cannot initialize any of 
the keys. If I perform a GET on the key I want to write to, I get an error that 
Precondition Failed. However, if I try to write to the key without context 
(since I cannot get a Vector Clock), I get a timeout.

In 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/strong-consistency/#Causal-Context
 

 it says that “it is possible to make writes to non-existing keys without 
attaching context”. Also, in 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/strong-consistency/#Strongly-Consistent-Writes
 
,
 it says that “If you know that a key does not yet exist, you can write to that 
key without supplying a context with the object”. However, there are no 
instructions on how to actually do that. I am wondering what are the commands 
needed to actually write a value to the key in the first place, so that it can 
read on subsequent writes.
