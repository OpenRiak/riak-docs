Anton,

Sorry for the delay. Yes you can use MapReduce link-phases in a similar way,
but unlike the link-walking resource, the objects pointed to in each phase
will not be returned. The way link-walking does its work is to split the
URL into segments for each phase that has keep=true (1), then issue a
MapReduce request for the traversal up to the first keep, then take the
results of that and feed it to another that goes up to the next keep, and so
on. So your link-walking query is actually more like:

[users/userid] -> link(projects, \_, 1) -> map\_value
(results from previous) -> link(parts, \_, 1) -> map\_value
(results from previous) -> link(units, \_, 1) -> map\_value
