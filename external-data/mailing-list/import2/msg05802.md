Hi,

I've posted a mail on this few days ago, but went a bit further since then.

I'm using ripple, running a map function on some input and getting a list of 
about 50 items.

Right after that, I'm running a reduce function. The first thing I do in it is 
putting the length of v (the input) as an item in a list.

When printing the result I see that the length is 13.

It's like something has happened between the map and reduce phases.

Any ideas?
