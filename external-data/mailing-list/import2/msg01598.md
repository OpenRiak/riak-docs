Hi Mark,

I think it would be helpful to add some words about upgrading riak nodes 
with a large amount of data,
because making a complete backup of data is not a reasonable task to do 
(takes too much space and time).

Maybe, in the "rolling upgrades" instructions, backup step is optionnal ?

Thank you for your answer.

Hey Tim,

In general, what's the process for upgrading a ring?

Do you take nodes out of the ring one at a time, upgrade them, and
re-add them to the ring, or do you build an entirely new ring and
restore the data from backups?

I imagine this partly depends on how many versions behind you are, and
the specific changes to the server and storage backends.


We just added a page to the wiki (this very morning, in fact) with
rolling upgrade instructions for Debian, Redhat and Solaris.
