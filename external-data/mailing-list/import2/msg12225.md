Suppose I want to just store keys in a bucket without any body, this make
sense in scenarios where the key completely identify the entity. Is it
possible to use the riak http api without including the content-type header?

Looking at the http specifications, content–type is not mandatory or
suggested when the body is empty:

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html#sec7.2.1

and it's probably a good argument to say that if the entity message is
empty then the content type doesn't really make sense.

Personally I think that just the existence of an http entity - body or not
body – is sufficient to justify a "type"; it's unfortunate that any other
higher type (entity type maybe?) - decoupled from what is defined as
content - exist in the spec.

Framework like spray are quite strict about this, not setting any content
type when the content is empty:

https://github.com/spray/spray/blob/master/spray-http/src/main/scala/spray/http/HttpEntity.scala#L74

how to deal with such situation? Adding a fake content because of this data
store constraint doesn't seems right.



Thanks,

Vincenzo.
