So, the way it should work is pretty simple:
Run the command a la: ./basho\_bench -N nodeA@1 0.0.1.123 -C
basho\_bench\_cookie 
(It's key that the IP address be the external IP, and not the internal IP
of the box, a la loopback)

In addition, nodeB must have the same version of Erlang installed as Node
A. So, typically, you should install ESL Erlang (my recommendation is R16,
https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp) on both
boxes, and compile your own Basho bench.

-Thanks,
Sargun!
