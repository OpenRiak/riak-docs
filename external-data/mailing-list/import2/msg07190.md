PBClusterConfig is used to produce a RawClient. IRiakClient is just a wrapper 
around RawClient. The cluster client is a RawClient. RawClient is more like 
that legacy RiakClient/RiakObject classes you're using.

See 
http://basho.github.com/riak-java-client/1.0.5/com/basho/riak/client/raw/pbc/PBRiakClientFactory.html
 for details.

Cheers

Russell
