Hi,
This is more of a question for developing riak as opposed to using it, 
anyway I thought it worth asking.
You have the "Counter" convergent datatype which allows increment and 
decrement of arbitrary integer values.
Would it be possible to implement an "Accumulator" datatype which would 
be a floating-point equivalent of counter and allow increment and 
decrement by arbitrary floating point values ?

Regards,
Emyr
