Riak Users,

We have now released Riak 1.1.1 RC 1. This is a release candidate for the 
upcoming bug fix release 1.1.1. This release is primarily to deal with 
MapReduce bugs found in 1.1.0.

Current release notes for 1.1.1: 
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.1/RELEASE-NOTES.org

You can download from our downloads site: http://basho.com/resources/downloads/

For those of you who experienced any MapReduce problems with 1.1.0, please give 
this a try and give us feedback!

We appreciate all the feedback we've already been given.

Thanks,
Jared
