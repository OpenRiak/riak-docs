Is deleting a strongly consistent key a consistent operation?  I have found in 
testing that if I delete a key and then attempt to immediately reuse it, 
sometimes the delete completes after I have reused it.  Should I expect that 
when I get a 204 from a delete that I can immediately create a new key with the 
same id?\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
