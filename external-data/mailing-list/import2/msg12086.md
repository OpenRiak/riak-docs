Created buckets in Riak or Riak CS? For what it's worth, we don't recommend 
using the same cluster for both Riak and Riak CS.

Can you gist/pastebin your Riak app.config? Make sure you're adding the default 
bucket properties to the `riak\_core` section of the app.config. As well as the 
result of:

curl localhost:8098/riak/random-bucket

For me, it looks like [1] (note the "allow\_mult": true line).
