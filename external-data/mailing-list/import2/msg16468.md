Hi All,

The Go client for Riak is out of beta, so Go get it!

To install it in your go project, just run `go get 
github.com/basho/riak-go-client` .

You can find more information on the project page 
(https://github.com/basho/riak-go-client 
), and in the API docs 
(https://godoc.org/github.com/basho/riak-go-client 
).

Special thanks to Luke Bakkan & Chris Mancini for their work on the client, 
Timo Gatsonides for his inspiring work on goriakpbc, and Sergio Arteaga for 
submitting GitHub issues.

Thanks,
Alex
