Hi all,

After some big rebalance of our cluster some keys are not found anymore 
unless we set R = 3, we had N = 3 and R = W = 2


Is there any sort of repair that would correct such situation for Riak 
2.2.3, this is really driving us nuts.


Any help will be truly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Guido.
