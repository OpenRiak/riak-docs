Riak was and still is a good platform, with the potential to be a
great platform.
I am fairly sure I am not the only one whose staked their reputation
on it.. The name is unimportant.

The question now is where is the focus going to be put next?

To ferret away whatever existing possibly panicking customers that
were abandoned during this transition or
to improve the platform so that it can reach it's potential;
benefiting from people experienced with what it is, what it was trying
to be, and where it was trying to go.
I still think this platform can be a business advantage while
simultaneously being the ladder that engineers can use to climb up and
participate in a difficult field.

As an open source product, everyone can see where it is, it is likely
better than the closed sourced portion of the product even.
As distributed systems programmers many of us knew and were excited
about areas where it could be improved. I often pointed directly
towards Riak Core.
As a business I am fairly certain not even Basho had an idea of where
it was actually trying to go...
I kinda think a lack of organization and priority in the latter two
pegs caused the Basho stool to finally fall down.

Basho created an internal group called Taishi which was in my hopes a
sounding board for the community in a deputized fashion within Basho,
where improvements could be discussed and implemented with assistance
from developers from around the world, but besides being given a
very nice hat and couple glasses, I did not see this materialize at all.

The direction and leadership won't materialize overnight, but at least
the conversation has really started,
I am sure there is some damage control that needs to be done as well
as I believe some customers included governments and hospitals.

I see a future in an Erlang based defacto standard for an open source
implementation of the Amazon Dynamo Paper.
I see this effort being multidisciplinary as Riak ran up against
several issues, many in Erlang itself,
recall github.com/basho/otp being a fork of the entire language distribution.

ESL could possibly be a good steward here, but there are many things
that need serious consideration.

I am motivated to talk more about this.
