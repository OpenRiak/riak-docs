Guido,The attached spreadsheet is best for 1.4.  Not sure how I missed getting it posted to the web-site.Riak admin only reports memory usage as known by the Erlang virtual machine.  leveldb is outside Erlang's awareness.The best memory measurement on a Linux machine is the /proc//status file.  I typically monitor the VmData value.Riak 1.4 greatly simplifies the memory management calculations compared to Riak 1.2/1.3.  But that does not mean it is easy.  The memory management for Riak 2.0 is completely changed.  You will only have to assign a total memory amount to be shared by all vnodes and leveldb will automatically split the memory wisely between the vnodes and each vnode's file cache and block cache … coming soon to a download near you ("soon" is measured in months).Matthew

 Hi,

 I'm trying to tune our Riak cluster using
 http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/#Parameter-Planning
 but I'm still lost on how to use the calculation results, here are
 my questions:

Does this calculator
 https://github.com/basho/basho\_docs/raw/master/source/data/LevelDB1.2MemModel\_calculator.xls
 applies to Riak 1.4.2?
How do I verify my running configuration? (I tried riak-admin
 status but somehow I can't relate the calculation with the
 obtained status, etc.)

And finally, based on the calculator, how do I use the
 results, what pertinent variables am I supposed to set in
 app.config in the LevelDB section?

 Thanks,
Guido.
