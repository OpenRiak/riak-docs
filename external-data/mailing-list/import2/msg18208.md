I'm aware of a few other companies and individuals who are interested in
continued development and support in a post-Basho world. Ideally the
community can come together and contribute to a single, canonical fork.

Semi-related, there's a good chance this mailing list won't last much
longer, either. I'm happy to personally contribute time and resources to
help maintain the community.
