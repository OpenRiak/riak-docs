Hi,

on a 3 node riak system running stock 0.12. After inserting a bunch of
data repetitively,
because I want to see when merge condition would trigger.

I saw it happen. But in the erlang.log

I saw a bunch of

=ERROR REPORT ====
Failed to merge
follow by a bunch of list of bitcask files

with final status

: no\_files\_to\_merge

how does this happen, does this mean some files in the bitcask are missing?
