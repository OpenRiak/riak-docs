Greetings all...

We have had a situation where someone ran a List Buckets query on the HTTP
interface on a large cluster. This caused the whole system to become
unresponsive and the only way we could think of to stop the load on the
system was to restart the whole cluster.

I've spent the morning trawling through the documentation, and can't find
answers to the following:

- Is it possible, and if so how does one go about terminating a query like
this? I can see things like Pid in riak-admin top, what can I do with it?
- Can we run useful things over HTTP like the /admin console but have the
rest of the HTTP API disabled?

Thanks,

Chris
