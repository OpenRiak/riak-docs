Anatoly,

The first time series TTL feature is due in Riak TS 1.4. That release is 
looking good for late August.

The 1.4 release establishes a global TTL (also known as expiry policy) for all 
data. A future release will allow individual policies per Riak TS table (yeah, 
I am coding on that now).

You can find some technical details about the feature here:

This feature will also arrive soon in our Riak KV 2.2.x product line.

Matthew
