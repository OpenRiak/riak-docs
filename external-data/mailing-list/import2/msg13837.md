Hello all!

I have a 6 machine cluster with leveldb as backend, using riak 1.4.8
version.

Today, the ssd of one of the machine's has failed and is not recoverable,
so I have already ordered a new one that should arrive by thursday!

In the meanwhile what should I do? I have no backup of the old ssd data...
Should I remove the machine of the cluster and when the new ssd arrives
join the machine again?

Best regards!
