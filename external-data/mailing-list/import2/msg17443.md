Can the ring size be changed easily in Riak 2.X?

Imagine I have 5 servers originally with a ring\_size = 64... If later on I
add 5 more servers (10 in total) and I also want to duplicate the
partitions, can I just edit the ring\_size to 128?

How would be the process to do it? Will it rebalance properly and have no
issues?

Thanks,
Alex
