 From the Riak docs (http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/#Tiered-Storage), under "selecting a level", it appears ‎the 10x rule doesn't apply to the lower levels, and oddly looks more like 20x for the higher ones.  Keep in mind that data can exist in multiple levels at the same time and there is overhead for metadata and headers.  Also, having AAE enabled greatly increases those storage sizes.I would judge the ideal level based on that table, as well as the maximum number of vnodes you will have on a single node since those numbers are for a single vnode.I hope this helps.PS. level 6 is unlimited, and only bound by the amount of data you store in Riak. From: Joe OlsonSent: Wednesday, 5 August 2015 23:33To: riak-users@lists.basho.comSubject: LevelDB QuestionSuppose I have come to the conclusion each of my LevelDB backed Riak nodes needs to hold 2TB of data.Also suppose I have the ability to store data on more expensive SSD drives, and less expensive magnetic drives.My question: What should leveldb.tiered be set to in /etc/riak/riak.conf?I know from the LevelDB docs on the Basho Riak site (http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/), each level holds 10x the data the level above it holds, starting at level 1 with 10MB.If this is correct, the data capacities of each level should be:Level 1: 10MBLevel 2: 100 MBLevel 3: 1 GBLevel 4: 10 GBLevel 5: 100 GBLevel 6: 1 TBIf this is this case, I would assume using leveldb.tiered = 5 (100GB) or leveldb.tiered = 6 (1 TB) of SSD capacity needed. The remainder (either 1.9 TB or 1 TB) will be stored on the magnetic drives on a different mount point.Am I reasoning this out correctly?If so, will my SSD drives ever \*exceed\* 100GB or 1TB of data? Not that I'd just it that close, anyway....
