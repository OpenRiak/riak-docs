The paid version has multi-datacenter replication, so yes, more reliable in 
that you can lose a datacenter and stay available. The OS riak is in no-way 
crippled on unreliable, it just doesnâ€™t have MDC replication.

Another huge benefit of paying is access to our support team, who are frankly 
amazing and amongst the best in any business.

BUT those same people, and engineers, and others can be found answering 
questions on IRC and this mailing list, often on their own time.

I hope that helps
