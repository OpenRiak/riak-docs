If you have much more short lived data than long lived data, tuning the
bitcask merge settings might help. Note that more frequent merging also
means more CPU and I/O usage.

I recently switched over to multi-backend exactly to deal with data in
different buckets having different life spans. The major issue with that
approach for us was that you cannot set which backend to use for a certain
bucket from the client library, but have to do that from the riak console,
which makes cluster setup less automated and more error prone.
