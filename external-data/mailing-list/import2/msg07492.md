The confusion is one of the reason I want to see non-KV indexing go away.

I'm glad Search is meeting your needs. I'm curious what parts of RDBMS do
you need that prevented you from using Riak to store the data itself?

solr emulation but instead moving it off into it's own layer/application
that sits atop Riak. I thought you should know.
