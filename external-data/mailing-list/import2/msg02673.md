3) Mark Wolfe put together some thoughtful observations about Riak and
the Java Client. This is a great read.

 I have started using the riak Client recently. One of the features I 
miss (which is present in Voldemort Java Client) is providing a Set of 
client nodes and the client performing operations on it (by holding n 
connections to each node).

Addressing these issues was exactly the reason I wrote the Spring Data support 
for Riak--though it doesn't address all the points raised in the way suggested. 
I wanted to make Riak support a first-class component alongside my other Spring 
components, so naturally I used the tools already available in Spring like the 
RestTemplate and the Jackson-based JSON HttpMessageConverter.

The Spring Data support for Riak is the basis upon which the Grails GORM 
support is built:
