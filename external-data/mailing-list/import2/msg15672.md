Hi Daniel,

I'm not sure of the specific regex you can run here. The most detail I
found is from this: https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/696

Engel (CC'ed) wrote:

\*Adds a regular expression filter for secondary index terms. With this\*
\*you can scan a range for a binary index from, say A through Z, but only\*
\*use items that match terms containing "AA".\*
\*This filter does not work with integer queries, but it does work with\*
\*$key queries.\*

Though maybe you can read the source code better than I can:
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/715/files#r7406033

I hope that helps,
Matt
