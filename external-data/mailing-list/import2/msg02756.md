I have implemented several hooks for riaks which currently reside in
modules that are not in the riak path.

Whenever I wish to install the hooks for a specific bucket, I first
run load\_module to make sure that the riak nodes can call the hooks.
The problem is that if one of the nodes goes down and then back up, it
will still try to call the hooks, but will not have access to the
module.

What is the recommended way to handle this? One idea I thought was
modifying ERL\_LIBS such that the hooks are included in its path, is
this the right approach?
