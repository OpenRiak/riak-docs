Hey all,

I'm looking for some best practices in handling connections when using the 
protocol buffer client. Specifically, I have 3 nodes in my cluster, and need 
to figure out how to handle the situation when one of the nodes is down.

I'm currently using a pooler app (https://github.com/seth/pooler) and this 
helps me distribute the load to all of the nodes, but when one goes down, the 
app doesn't recover nicely.

I'm about to write some code in my app to handle this, but before I do, I 
thought I'd check for existing solutions and best practices:

- Is there an existing connection pooling mechanism that someone has created 
which handles node failures automatically?

If not, then I'm looking forward to writing it!

Thank in advance,
Marc\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
