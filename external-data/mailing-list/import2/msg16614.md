Hi Yang,

Could you say a little more about what your requirements are, particularly 
around reliability? For example, what is your n\_val, if you are using a 2-node 
cluster?

It would also help to know how many worker processes you have in your basho 
bench config (the concurrent setting), as well as more information about your 
scenario. Are you using CRDTs? Allowing siblings? Or using strong 
consistency, etc.

Thanks!

-Fred
