Maybe use a validating pre-commit hook?

I agree on this one. It would be great to have the equivalent of 
HEAD/If-None-Match in the PBC API. Actually even just providing a HEAD type 
request in the PBC API would be great. I can think of numerous situations where 
I'd like to inspect the metadata without having to mess with the content.
