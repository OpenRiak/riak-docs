I have done some tests with read-your-writes consistency i Riak 1.0.

I am testing with 3 Riak nodes and N=3, W=2 and R=2 (standard config)

I get read-your-writes consistency as long as the client sends write and
read request to one of the three Riak node only. But if I write data with a
connection to node 1 and then read the data with a connection to node 2 I
sometimes get a read failure.

Is this the expected behavior? 
Do I need to talk to one node only to be sure that I get read-your-writes
consistency?
