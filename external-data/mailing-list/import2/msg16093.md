Hello Everyone,

My proposal[0] for adding Riak as a destination to Syslog-ng was accepted
for GSoC2015, so before my coding period begins i.e. 25th May, I wanted to
do some ground work and take some feedback from the potential users.
The proposal[0] contains all the initial implementation details which might
require improvement .
Therefore if some of you could take a look and give me some feedback on it,
would help me greatly.
Below are a few links to important snippets of the proposal.
