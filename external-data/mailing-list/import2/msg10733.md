Hi Kartik,

The reduce phase will normally run recursively a number of times as results 
come in from map phases on different nodes [1]. This allows Riak to start 
reducing the results before all data is available and will not require all 
input data to be stored in memory on the coordinating node. The output from the 
first iteration will be passed into the following iteration together with the 
next batch of map phase results. When processing large amounts of data this is 
the most efficient way to do it, and reduce functions should be written in a 
way so that they can handle this.

If you know that the number of results will be manageable or the reduce phase 
requires all results to be processed at once, there is an argument called 
'reduce\_phase\_only\_1' [1] that can be specified in order to force the reduce 
phase to run only once all map phase results are available.

In your case you might however be able to completely eliminate the reduce phase 
if you made the map phase perform filtering and formatting. If a record does 
not match the criteria, you just return [].

This would give you a list of JSON documents instead of a single one, but would 
most likely be more efficient.

Best regards,

Christian
