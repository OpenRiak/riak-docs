You know, the more I look at this piece, the more I conclude there just is 
nowhere to put a programmatic installation of the schema into riak. I can't do 
it from my application, which does not run as user 'riak', nor as user 'root'. 
So it doesn't have the needed permissions to run search-cmd and change the 
schema. The documentation strongly warns against directly manipulating the 
bucket of schemas. I could install the schema from script as a part of the 
software install process, but there is no guarantee that riak is even running 
at that time. So the only other option seems to hack the riak startup script or 
create a cronjob or some other kludgeism. 

So how are people handling this? Is everyone having their sysadmin install the 
schema by hand? Surely someone has come up with something automated! Sighâ€¦
