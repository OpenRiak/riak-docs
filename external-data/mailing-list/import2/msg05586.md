Hi Joel,

That's not a message I'd expect to see on a clean restart. We'll need some
more information to diagnose it. Next time it crashes, could you provide
the contents of your ring file (you can just grab the most recent one out
of /var/lib/riak/ring - location may vary depending on your platform) and
it would be very helpful if you could modify your deploy script to capture
the file list for the leveldb directory on \*all\* of your nodes immediately
before you bounce riak to do the update. When it crashes, the console.log
from all the nodes would also be useful. If any of those files contain
sensitive information, please contact me off list.

BR, Jon
