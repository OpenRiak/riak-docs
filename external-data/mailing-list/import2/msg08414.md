Howdy Riak Users,

Recently I discovered that my MapReduce job, that used to run
successfully, stopped working.
Here is the error:
{"phase":0,"error":"[timeout]","input":"{<<\"test\">>,<<\"123\">>}","type":"forward\_preflist","stack":"[]"}

Is anyone familiar with this problem? How can I make it to work?

-Matthew
