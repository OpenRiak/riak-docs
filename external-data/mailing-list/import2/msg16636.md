Greetings and salutations, Vanessa.

I am obliged to point out that running n\_val of 3 (or more) is highly
detrimental in a cluster size smaller than 5 nodes. Needless to say, it is
not recommended. Let's talk about why that is the case for a moment.

The default level of abstraction in Riak is the virtual node, or vnode. The
vnode represents a segment of the ring (ring\_size, configurable in steps of
power of 2, default 64, min 8, max 1024.) The "ring" is the number line 0 -
2^160 which represents the output of the SHA hash.

Riak achieves high availability through replication. Riak replicates data
to vnodes. A hypothetical replica set may be, for example, set[vnode 1,
vnode 10, vnode 20]. Note, I said vnodes. Not physical nodes. And therein
lies the concern. Considering a default ring size of 64 and a default
replica count of 3, the minimum recommended production deployment of a Riak
cluster should be 5 due to the fact that in that circumstance every replica
set combination is guaranteed to have each vnode on a distinct physical
node. Anything less than that will certainly have some combinations of
replica sets which have two of its copies on the same physical host. Note I
said some combinations. Some fraction of node replica set combinations will
have two of their copies allocated to one physical machine.

You can see where I'm going with this. Firstly, performance will be
negatively impacted when writing more than one copy of data to the same
physical hardware, aka disk. But more importantly, you are negating Riak's
high availability mechanic. If you lost any given physical node you would
lose access to two copies of the set of data which had two replicas on that
node.

Riak is designed to withstand loss of any two physical nodes while
maintaining access to 100% of your corpus assuming the fact that you are
running the default settings and have deployed 5 nodes.

Here is the rule of thumb that I recommend (me personally, not Basho) to
folks looking to deploy clusters with less than 5 nodes:

1,2 nodes: n\_val 1
3,4 nodes: n\_val 2
5+ nodes: n\_val 3

In summary, please consider reconfiguring your production deployment.

Sincerely,
Alexander

Hi Dmitri, what would be the benefit of r=2, exactly? It isn't necessary to
trigger read-repair, is it? If it's important I'd rather try it sooner than
later...

Regards,
Vanessa
