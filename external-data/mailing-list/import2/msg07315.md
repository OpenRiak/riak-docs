Sati,

Check, if you see the following error in your log file:

It means that all js\_vm crash on start. I had similar problem with 1.1.1,
it is because
'mapred\_builtins.js' is missing in '/lib/riak\_kv-1.1.1/priv/'
folder.
Copy it there from "
https://raw.github.com/basho/riak\_kv/master/priv/mapred\_builtins.js".

Alternatively you can update to 1.1.2 (
https://github.com/basho/riak/zipball/riak-1.1.2).
It's solved there.
