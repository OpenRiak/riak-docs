That is exactly correct. Most everything performance wise in riak when it comes 
to m/r, best as I can tell, revolves around total number of objects in a 
bucket. If your architecture can be constructed in such a way that your buckets 
will have tens of thousands of keys vs. hundreds of thousands or millions of 
keys then the list all keys function that is called when you pass a bucket via 
the input field of a map/reduce function will execute that much quicker. Also 
note that the input field will accommodate bucket/key pairs, although I have 
not tested passing in thousands of bucket/key pairs to a map/reduce function.

In my testing of riak I have been bypassing the internal list keys function as 
much as possible in favor of my own bucket index key kept in a separate \_index 
bucket of my own fashion or better, in a redis set. My testing tops out at keys 
less than 100k per bucket though which is enough for my use cases. Redis is a 
fantastic pairing with riak, imho. Specifically the atomicity of it's functions 
like set and increment which are not in the riak offering. When using redis in 
a purely index capacity you do not have to be as concerned with it's memory 
footprint.

Here is an exercise: Lets say you have a bucket with 10000 keys. You use the 
bucket name as input in one m/r and list out 10000 b/k pairs in another. Which 
would run faster?
