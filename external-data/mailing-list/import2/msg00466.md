For all you guys trying to use the awesome Devise authentication
plugin for Rails... with Riak:

http://github.com/frank06/devise-ripple

It is working fine for me so far with many Devise modules (although
due to Ripple lagging a bit behind egdy Rails versions, we need to
stick to revision 9291ab).

Let me know if you have trouble running it; patches are always welcome.

Francisco
