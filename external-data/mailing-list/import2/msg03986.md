Riak Recap for July 8 - 10
===================

1) Q --- If I've attached to a node using "riak attach", is there a
way to clear the state of all the variables, etc.?

 A --- f().

2) The team at Boundary just released a library called Scalang. It's a
"scala wrapper that makes it easy to write services that interface
with Erlang."

While I'm unaware of anyone who is using Riak with Scalang (just
yet...), I thought I would pass it along as this it opens up some
interesting possibilities for anyone who was looking for a simple way
to make Scala and Erlang (and Riak) play nice.

\* Details here ---> http://twitter.com/#!/boundary/status/90537108841828352

3) One job to pass along:

\* Ideeli is hiring engineers with Riak, MySQL and MongoDB experience.
