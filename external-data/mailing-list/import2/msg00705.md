There are various riak clients out there right now.
Some official, some not. Most are http REST based.

as far as I know, the erlang native client is the only prototocol buffer
based version.

I remember hearing that protocol buffer version is about 10x faster
than HTTP.

so if I want to bulk load a lot of data, is using erlang client the fastest
way?
