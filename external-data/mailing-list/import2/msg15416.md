Hi Sargun,


>>1) I recommend you have a 5-node cluster:

We'll add another node for sure.

>> 2) What version of Riak are you using?

2.0.1

>> 3) What backend(s) are you using?

leveldb

>> 4) What's the size of your keyspace?

Not sure what to answer here.


>> 5) Are you actively rewriting keys, or writing keys to the cluster?

Yes, plenty of other operations on this cluster for reading/writing etc.
This particular key does not get written to anymore once its initially
created.

>> 6) Do you know how much I/O the cluster is currently doing?

Very little at the moment (almost non-existant) as we haven't ported any of
our clients onto this new system just yet - we ran a load test against our
system and then 2 days later without any changes at all we started noticing
this timeout issue.


We turned on debug messages temporarily and have noticed this in the logs:

2014-12-29 11:51:44.957 [error] <0.14490.1> gen\_fsm <0.14490.1> in state
waiting\_vnode\_r terminated with reason: bad argument in call to
erlang:hd([]) in riak\_object:most\_recent\_content/1 line 228

Thanks,
Jason
