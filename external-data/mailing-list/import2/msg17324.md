Hi all,

When creating a SOLR schema for Riak Search, we can chose to store or not
the data we are indexing, for example:



I know that the point to have the value stored is to be able to get it
returned automatically when doing a search query... that implies using more
disc to store data that maybe never would be searched and making the return
slower as more bytes are required to get the data.

Would it be better to just index data but not store the values, returning
only Riak IDs (\_yz\_id) and then doing a multi-get in the client/API to
fetch the objects for the final response?

Or would it be better to store the values in SOLR so they will be already
fetched when searching?

What would give better performance or more sense in terms of disc space on
an application that normally you won't be using much searching (all data is
more or less discoverable without searching using GETs)

Thanks and Best Regards,
Alex
