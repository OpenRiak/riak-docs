Ill just chime in and say that this is not practical for a few reasons. The 
largest known riak cluster has like 50 or 60 nodes. Afaik, inter node 
communication of erlang clusters top out at a few hundred nodes. I'm also under 
the impression that each physical node has to have enough file descriptors to 
accommodate every virtual node in the cluster. 

I'd love to hear more from basho.
