After further testing we have found that keys that store Maps in general
and not just nested maps created by Riak 2.0.0 to 2.0.2 are unreadable
after upgrading to 2.0.4

Thus Users will be affected if they
- Use Riak DataTypes to store Maps
AND
- Have already upgraded to Riak 2.0.4

If you do not use Riak DataTypes (aka CRDTs) you are not affected and may
upgrade to 2.0.4 as normal.

Note that customers using multi-datacenter replication (MDC) between sites
with 2.0.0-2 and 2.0.4 will also experience failures.

Basho is preparing two fixes for the issue. The first fix is to enable
reading data in the old and new formats, and the second fix is to add
controls for which version is written for rolling upgrade and
multi-datacenter configurations. Both are targeted for the 2.0.5 release.

Do let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for your
patience.
