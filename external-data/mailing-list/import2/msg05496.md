@Andrew
erlang builds fine every time, never had a problem with that.
following the riak build sequence to the letter that you listed riak builds
fine like last time
but the same message comes up:
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~/Desktop/riak/rel/riak$ bin/riak start
escript: Failed to open file:
~/Desktop/riak/rel/riak/erts-5.9/bin/nodetoolbellowescript: Failed to open
file: ~/Desktop/riak/rel/riak/erts-5.9/bin/nodetool
 Error reading ~/Desktop/riak/rel/riak/etc/app.config
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
so then I went ahead and tried out to see what happens if I move "nodetool"
from erts-5.8.4 to erts-5-9, which is where it seems to be looking for it
at, only to get further new errors:
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~/Desktop/riak/rel/riak$ mv erts-5.8.4/bin/nodetool erts-5.9/bin/
~/Desktop/riak/rel/riak$ bin/riak start

Crash dump was written to: erl\_crash.dump
 init terminating in do\_boot ()

Crash dump was written to: erl\_crash.dump

Error reading ~/Desktop/riak/rel/riak/etc/app.config
{"init terminating in do\_boot",{'cannot get bootfile','start\_clean.boot'}}
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

thanks
