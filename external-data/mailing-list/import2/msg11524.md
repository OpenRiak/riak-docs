I don't know if this is a client (Java 1.1.1 client) or server issue....

I recently upgraded to 1.4 and I am now seeing timeout issues when my app is 
trying to read data either via mapreduce or getting all keys for a bucket. 
Currently my server has no data (this is my test server and I wiped everything 
for the upgrade).

The client is using the PB interface.

Is this a known issue?

I did not have this problem on 1.3 and when running the 1.1.0 client.

Thanks.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
