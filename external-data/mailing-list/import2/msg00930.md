That's just an overenthusiastic message, and nothing to worry about.
It was a very useful thing to see when doing the initial bitcask
integration/backend into Riak. The message will cease to appear from
your error log in a subsequent release.

All it means is that one merge was scheduled while another was
running, so the first one did all the work and the second had nothing
to do.
