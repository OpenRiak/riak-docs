Afternoon, Evening, and Morning to all,

Another great recap for today: Some additions to Fast Track and Best
Practices section on Riak wiki, slides and blog posts, an update Perl
client, and much, much more.

\*\*\*Before we get started... Anyone out there fancy themselves a
Graphic Artist/Designer? I have a small (and unpaid) Riak-related
project that Basho needs help with. Want to put your mark on the Riak
and greater nosql community? Get in touch for details.\*\*\*

Now, onto the Recap.

Enjoy -

Mark

Riak Recap for 6/7

1) @seancribbs added some .json files to the MapReduce page on the
Fast Track. You can download these and run them exactly as seen in the
MapReduce Screencast.

Go test them out here --->

2) @rklophaus posted a thorough and generally-awesome overview of Day
One at the Berlin Buzzwords Conference. Check it out for details on
his two Riak-related talks and the rundown of the other great stuff
being discussed yesterday.

3) @roidrage, ever the consummate NoSQL professional, gave a great
overview of the space yesterday at Berlin Buzzwords. He has a lot of
slides, but they are all worth it.

Check them out here ---> http://nosql-berlinbuzzwords2010.heroku.com/#1

4) For anyone at Railsconf right now, get in touch with @seancribbs!
He has T shirts and is apparently building Riak clusters out of
people... http://twitter.com/wearefound/status/15713131827

5) We added a page to the Riak Wiki called Hosting and Configuration
Tuning under the "Best Practices" Section.

Check it out here --->

6) @bjnortier just let it leak that http://www.dayfindr.com is
approaching 2.0. and is now based on Nitrogen and Riak.

7) For those of you Perl hackers out there, it looks like Frank Cuny
has been doing some work on the Anyevent-Riak Adapter.

Check out the latest changes here --->

8) For all of our Japanese hackers, a post called "Cassandra vs. Riak"
came across the twitters yesterday.
