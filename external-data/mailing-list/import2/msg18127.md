Hi,
Which client are you using?

The context you get from a fetch is the one you should send back with the 
resolved value, whatever strategy you use to converge the sibling values into a 
single value (even “pick one”!)

You should check the docs for the client library you use whether it handles 
passing the context around “behind” the scenes for you or not.

Is there a client that implicitly resolves siblings via a call to “getValue”? 
Even if there is, I would hope and expect that it uses the same causal context 
as it fetched, and should therefore be the same as the one returned by 
”getValues”. If you let use know which client you use I could probably give a 
more certain answer.
