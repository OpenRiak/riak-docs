I am aware that the BucketMapReduce has a method called addReducePhase, but
the documentation on java does not tell me what should go in the parameters,
and I haven't found any examples of it. I have a clue of how to do what I
need to do manually, using an arraylist, but, If the API has the reducephase
option It would be cool to understand how it works.
