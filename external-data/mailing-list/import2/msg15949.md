Good to know it will finally get fixed : )

[not sure how that didn’t turn up until now] ---> I actually reported it
several times in the past:

August 2014:
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2014-August/015702.html

September 2014:
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2014-September/015884.html

and now again in March 2015 : P

Thanks,
Alex
