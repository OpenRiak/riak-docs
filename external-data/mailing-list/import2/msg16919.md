Magnus

Thanks for confirming.
We've had issues with 2i (coverage queries) during node startup where some
keys potentially might not appear in results.
More details on the here:

http://riak-users.197444.n3.nabble.com/Keys-not-listed-during-vnode-transfers-td4027133.html#a4027139

We've been using wait-for-service in our script but that was not sufficient
to workaround issue with 2i.
I will try to workaround it or check if newer version of Riak solved to 2i
problem.

Thanks
