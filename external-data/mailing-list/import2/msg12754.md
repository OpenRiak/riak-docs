Does anyone have any experience or know of any reasons to avoid running a Riak 
cluster with different filesystems backing different nodes?

With all other cluster components (hardware, OS, Riak version, Riak backend 
[leveldb], etc.) being equal, I'm really interested in doing a comparison of a 
node backed by XFS and one backed by ext4. I wondered whether we could simply 
do an A/B test by swapping out the filesystem on one node in the cluster and 
observing the impact that this has. I can't come up with any reasons why this 
is a bad idea, other than the obvious risk of impacting performance if the new 
filesystem performs much worse.

Thanks,
Tom
