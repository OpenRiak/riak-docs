Hi,

I would like to use MapR with Riak CS for hadoop map reduce jobs. My code
is currently referring to objects using s3n:// urls.
I'd like to be able to have the hadoop code on MapR point to the Riak CS
cluster using the s3 url.
Is there a proxy or hostname setting in hadoop to be able to route the s3
url to the riak cs cluster ?

Thanks
