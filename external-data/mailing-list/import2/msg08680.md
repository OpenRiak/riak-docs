The pull request doesn't fix the HttpClient issue, it is more like a 
workaround the issue in the code, if you notice, even if they didn't 
upgrade the POM, the issue won't be reproduced by the riak java client.

Guido,

Reading the comments on that pull request, I get the feeling that pcl 
is suggesting that upgrading to 4.2.2 is another way to solve the 
problem. I dont think that route was taken to resolve the issue. 
Quoting his comment...


 upgrading your dependency to 4.2.2 once it becomes available will
 \*also\* resolve the issue 



I dont see a change to pom.xml during this pull. I tried the 
riak-client 1.0.6 and it still depends on 4.1.x. So the upgrade would 
be necessary to fix the memory leak.


Thanks

 Deepak,

 I think that was fixed on the following pull request but, you
 would have to compile your own client from github which is easy;
 or, did you get the new 1.0.6? I'm not sure if it is already
 available at maven repos, anyways, there is a lot going on in the
 riak client in java, I would suggest you to keep an eye on the
 github, many good bugs getting fixed quickly.

 Hi,

 My servers complain about a leaky apache DateUtils class during
 hot deployments. This is a known bug
  in http
 4.1.x and has been fixed in 4.2.x. Can the next version of
 riak-client be updated to include the newer HTTP client (the
 current version is 4.1.1 ) ? Is the riak-client compatible with
 httpclient 4.2.x as it is ?

 Thanks
 Deepak Bala
