Hi Kathleen, 

Deleting the ring and data directories after running 'riak stop' will wipe the 
node of all state and data. By default, the backend data and ring directories 
are within the riak data directory(noted in app.config). Running and "rm -rf 
/path/to/data/dir" once the node has been stopped will do the trick.

Let me know if you have questions.
