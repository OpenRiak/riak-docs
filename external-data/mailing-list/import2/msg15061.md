Toby,

That's be for sure inconvenient. CS team is working on CS 2.0, which
will be based on Riak 2.0, and then that inconvenience will go away.
Honestly, just renaming Riak 1.4's app.config to advanced.config for
Riak 2.0 might have a chance to work with CS 1.5. So far we haven't
yet found any reason that does not work, but it is just not tested and
officially supported.
