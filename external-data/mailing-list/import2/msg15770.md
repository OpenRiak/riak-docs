Hi AM, 

Additionally, it would be great if you could provide additional information on 
how you plan on querying both the original and aggregated values. Querying is 
usually the most difficult part to get right in Riak, and your query pattern 
will be very important in establishing the best way to lay out this data on 
disk.
