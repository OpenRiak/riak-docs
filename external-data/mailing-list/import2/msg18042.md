Have a look in
https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/blob/master/docs/FUTURE.md and the
"Riak Features Implemented"

I'm trying to avoid the need for Riak to Get n times for every request
(both a KV GET and a KV PUT), when really it only needs the body once, and
the n-1 times it doesn't need the body if the HEAD response confirms that
the vector clock is at the expected state. As values get larger there's a
lot of unnecessary disk activity in those GETs.

To understand all the Journal/Inker stuff have a look at
https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/blob/master/docs/DESIGN.md

The Inker is an actor that controls the Journal - the Journal is a
transaction log where all the values are stored permanently, made up of a
series of CDB files where everything is ordered by sequence number. The
Keys and Metadata are stored in a merge tree called the Ledger - and the
Ledger is controlled by an actor called the Penciller. So the HEAD request
should just need to check in the Ledger via the Penciller. A GET request
must follow that same path, and then once it has the metadata, it has the
sequence number and so can use that to fetch the value from the Journal via
the Inker.

Does this make sense?

My apologies, as the naming may not be helpful. Perhaps one of the
drawbacks of working in isolation on this.

Thanks

Martin
