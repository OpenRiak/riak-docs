Hi there,

I'm trying to delete objects from riak with the python library and is
timing out, any ideas? (this example is from a simple object, but also have
issues with bucket types with map objects, etc...)... Just I seem to unable
to delete anything, just times out.

























\*>>> import riak>>> RIAK = riak.RiakClient(protocol = 'pbc', nodes =
[{'host': '--------', 'http\_port': 8098, 'pb\_port': 8087}])>>> x =
RIAK.bucket('test').get('something')>>> print x.data{"something":"here"}>>>
x.delete()Traceback (most recent call last): File "", line 1, in
 File
"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/riak/riak\_object.py", line 329, in
delete timeout=timeout) File

RiakError(bytes\_to\_str(err.errmsg))riak.riak\_error.RiakError: 'timeout'\*

My Riak version is 2.1.4

My Python library is (installed via pip):
Name: riak
Version: 2.2.0
Location: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Requires: six, pyOpenSSL, riak-pb

Thanks,
Alex
