Gal,

0.5 to 1 MB/s is indeed painfully slow.

A few questions:
What backend are you running: bitcask,leveldb, etc?
Are you using the local ephemeral storage, or running off EBS?
Are you running any software RAID?
What filesystem are you running?
Which OS are you using?
Have you changed any of Riak's default settings?

Also, any chance you could provide the output of "iostat -x" during
one of these long handoff sessions? Preferably on both the sending and
receiving nodes.

The more information we have, the better we can try to help out here.

Regards,
Joe
