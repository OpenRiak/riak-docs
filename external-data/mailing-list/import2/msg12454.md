Hi Jeff,

Can you provide the output of the date command on the machine where Riak is
running as well as the one from which you're running curl? I'm assuming
it's the same workstation, but I'd like to be sure.

Based on the stack traces you provide, the
localtime\_to\_universaltimefunction is failing when called with
[{{2013,9,28},{8,0,35}},true] as the arguments, which really doesn't make
sense.

Could you run that method via the erl command in the Erlang build used by
your Riak installation? I have built Riak from source so erl is in the
erts-5.9.1/bin directory, for instance:

lbakken ~/Projects/basho/riak\_ee-1.4/dev/dev1/erts-5.9.1/bin
((riak\_ee-1.4.2))
$ ./erl
Erlang R15B01 (erts-5.9.1) [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:0]
[kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V5.9.1 (abort with ^G)
1> erlang:localtime\_to\_universaltime({{2013,9,28},{8,0,35}}, true).
{{2013,9,28},{15,0,35}}
2> q().
ok
