Jason,

When you change the conflict resolution settings, you change conflict 
resolution subsequent to that point - but you already generated siblings before 
your change. 

It is not necessary to restart Riak after changing bucket-type or bucket 
properties. 

Are you still generating siblings or are you just encountering siblings which 
were generated prior to your bucket-type properties change?
