Hello Mark,

There is currently no implementation in CI which allows this. Having said
that, it's something that we have pondered ourselves. It might just be high
time to get that sorted out.

I have created a github issue[1] so we can talk about it. May I request
that we move the discussion there? I am very keen to help get a solution
together for you.

Thanks for the contact!
OJ
