I am curious as to how that was accomplished when using vnode version
vectors. As section 3.2 of the paper mentions, the node with concurrent
updates could detect they are concurrent and it could reject the update,
but how could you encode the causal history using the version vectors so as
to generate a sibling? That section ends with a statement saying no such
version vector could be generated.

Presumably Riak implemented a version vector that is somewhat different
from that described in the paper?
