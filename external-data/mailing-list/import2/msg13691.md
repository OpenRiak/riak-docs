Toby,

At some point, yes the "missing" space is recovered. But that does not mean 
the deletes will be found immediately upon 2.0 upgrade.

2.0 adds statistical data to each newly generated .sst table file so that it 
"knows" where delete entries are hidden. The statistical data drives the 
aggressive delete removal. 

Normal compaction grooming will find the deletes in 1.4 generated files over 
time. Time here could be measured in months. It all depends upon how fast 
your data is filling "levels".

Matthew
