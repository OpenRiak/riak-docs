If you are looking install and /etc/init.d support, you should really just
be installing the packages.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/riak/CURRENT/rhel/6/riak-1.2.1-1.el6.x86\_64.rpmis
the package for Centos 6 found here
http://basho.com/resources/downloads/. Building from source is there for
those who need a feature not currently in a release, want to make additions
to Riak, or are on an unsupported platform.
