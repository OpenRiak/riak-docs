The error message you're receiving is coming from Riak itself, not the
client. You're discarding the stack trace in your code by printing
`Ex.getMessage()` instead of just `Ex`.

Your code, as it it written now, is fine. You've got some problem on
the Riak side that you'll ned to look in the log files to diagnose.

Here's a gist showing that your code isn't the problem:
