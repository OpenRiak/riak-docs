Is there a way via the HTTP API to get the HTTP port the other nodes on
a cluster are listening on, assuming of course that I know one of the
nodes' listening port?

I am trying to find a way to pass in connection information for one of
the nodes in a cluster to an app I am writing in Go, and then
programmatically determine the addresses of the other nodes in the
cluster so I can connect to them and gather performance data. Assuming I
always use default ports, this isn't an issue, but I would like this to
work for non-default, unknown ports.

Thanks for any suggestions!
