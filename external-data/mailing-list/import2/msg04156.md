It's possible to update objects from Erlang MapReduce, but that doesn't 
conflict with the answer to 4) because it's still a similar workflow of 
fetching (through MapReduce) and then storing the object back. The original 
question refered to partial updates, e.g. appending a new entry to a list 
stored e.g. as JSON under a specific key in an atomic fashion, which is not 
possible in Riak either way.
