Hi Kyle,

There is currently no option to delete bucket types once they have been
created. Are you trying to delete a bucket type and any objects stored
within the namespace of the bucket type, or just remove a previously
configured bucket type?

In Riak, bucket types have very little operational overhead. They get
stored in the cluster meta data and take up a small amount of disk space
there. Bucket types are not gossiped around the ring on a regular basis,
though, and therefore have not got the negative impact a large number of
custom buckets would have. With Riak-2.x we generally recommend storing any
configuration in bucket types, rather than creating custom buckets, even if
there is only one bucket using that specific configuration.


Kind Regards,

Magnus
