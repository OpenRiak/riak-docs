Ivan,

The erlang version is checked in the rebar.config file. You should see a line 
like this: {require\_otp\_vsn, "R14B0[23]"}. 

It's strange that you end up with 2 differents erts folders in your rel 
directory. I would suggest wiping out the rel/riak directory and rebuilding. If 
you're still getting issues then it sounds like just a path problem so try to 
verify your environment and maybe just remove the R15A installation altogether. 
Hope that helps.

Kelly
