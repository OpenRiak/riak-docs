Yeah, in attempt number two the index names and values have been url encoded 
when creating the relevant HTTP headers and when doing the index fetch the 
index name and value are again encoded. 

What is probably happening is that Riak will decode the incoming fetch url and 
then use the decoded values to match against indexes internally (since the 
http\_url\_encoding setting will be set to "on" for most people). Since those 
indexes themselves have been encoded, they won't match.

Approach number 3), double encoding the index name and value when constructing 
the fetch URL, works in all cases but seems a bit overkill. 

If nothing better comes along I guess I'll go with number 3)

Thanks,
Age
