Hi Praveen,

It's unusual to want to set the handoff.ip address to 127.0.0.1 unless
you're trying to run multiple nodes on a single machine (we call that a
devrel). As you may have noticed we just issued a data loss advisory about
exactly that - please see
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2015-May/017146.html

\*Only\* set handoff.ip to 127.0.0.1 if you are running the nodes on the same
machine. I suspect what you want instead is a private network between the
nodes, in which case you should configure handoff.ip to be the node address
on the private network.
