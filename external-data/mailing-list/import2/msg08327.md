Hi Ryan,

I'm using ver. 1.2.0 too. It happens only on bucket with indexing enabled.
I think it depends on the Analyzer factory.
My index schema was:
...
 {dynamic\_field, [
 {name, "\*"},
 {type, string},
 {analyzer\_factory, {erlang, text\_analyzers, \*
whitespace\_analyzer\_factory\*}}
 ]}
...

Since I've changed the default factory from
whitespace\_analyzer\_factory to standard\_analyzer\_factory
it seems to work.
My current index schema is:
...
 {dynamic\_field, [
 {name, "\*"},
 {type, string},
 {analyzer\_factory, {erlang, text\_analyzers, \*
standard\_analyzer\_factory\*}}
 ]}
...

It looks like the whitespace\_analyzer\_factory has some differences compare
to standard\_analyzer\_factory.

Thanks
Vladimir
