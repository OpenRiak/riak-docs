"A tombstone
is put and then an async get is fired off and if the async get finds all
the primary nodes in the preflist are up, it does the delete. If not,
the next time the key is fetched, it does the same check again and will
do the delete then if the downed node is up."

What if the key is never fetched again after the node is up? Does this mean one 
would have to do GETs on all keys deleted while the node was down after the 
node is back online, in order to reclaim that space?
