Hi all,Thanks for taking over riak management.I am strongly commited to
the success of this take over as we intensively use riak for our
customers solutions.Arnaud Wetzel, founder and CTO of KBRW, the company
I'm actually working for, has been contributing to riak but, due the
lack of visibility on the roadmap, we have also been maintaining our
own build of riak.Precisely, we use 3 flavours of riak:\* our own build,
based on riak 1.1, with additional patches: for instance, https://githu
b.com/basho/merge\_index/pull/32\* a vanilla riak 2.2\* riak TS 1.3.0
As many of us, I suppose, we are really interested in sharing the
efforts on riak and want to contribute to it.
In a few words, by the past, we (ie Arnaud Wetzel :) ), has contributed
to the following features that are now integrated upstream:\* IPV6
support (mainly through BEAM)\* Cassandra search algorithm integration
into riak\_search (pending pull request)\* geoloc search, now merged into
SOLR\* Symfony bundle for riak (yeah, some use it :) )
Regarding the license, we also agree on Apache 2, and would like to
avoid GPL.
Regarding the governance, we support the following points:\* limit
community disruption\* looking out how to mitigate the roadmap
uncertainty and lack of transparency of the recent period.We are
convinced that a better balance between community and business should
help to avoid this issue.
I need now to introduce myself with my other hat of OW2 consortium
chairman. This organization aims at supporting open source projects
providing:\* supporting infrastructure: gitlab, continuous integration,
mailing lists, etc (in case project need them)\* maturity assesment
tools\* best practices and governance guidelines to help reaching it\*
logistic support with a strong presence into international conferences,
dedicated booths for our corporate members, etc
I would be glad to join the meeting at Bet365 facilities to discussing
these points.
Regards,Jean
