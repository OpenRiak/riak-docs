I would advise against search for many reasons. IMO writing two copies of a
value - one in a map (when the entire map is required) and the other in a
separate key (for most cases) will work much better.

You can also store the values of a map in separate keys for
retrieval/updates, and also have a set of the keys for those [rare] cases
when you need all values that belong to the map. The latter requires
several round-trips, but I believe will be still faster, easier to
maintain, and more reliable than search.

Regards,
Vitaly
