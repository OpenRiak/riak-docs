Joel -

You can look on our GitHub site:

http://github.com/basho/yokozuna
http://github.com/basho/yokozuna/tree/master/docs

It's based on Apache's Solr  project, 
which sits on top of Lucene .


Just let us know if you'd like more pointers.

Thanks for the reply Mark. Our legacy database format is of a 
proprietary flavor. So we aren't necessarily moving from anything 
standard. I just want to make sure we will get good performance 
querying ranges of floating point data. Is there someplace I can read 
more about Yokozuna?
