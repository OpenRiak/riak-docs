First of all, thank you for your replies, Brian and Christian.

I rewrote the script in python:

#######################
import riak
import time
import sys

hostname = '10.1.1.221'
portnumber = 8087
#portnumber = 8098
if len(sys.argv) > 1:
 hostname = sys.argv[1]

#client = riak.RiakClient(host=hostname,port=portnumber)
client =
riak.RiakClient(host=hostname,port=portnumber,transport\_class=riak.RiakPbcTransport)
print hostname + ':' + str(portnumber)

# Choose the bucket to store data in.
bucket = client.bucket('nBucket')

data = 'X' \* 10240
cnt = 0
last = time.time()

while 1 :
 obj = bucket.new(None, data)
 obj.store()
 cnt += 1
 if time.time() - last >= 1:
 print cnt
 last = time.time()
 cnt = 0
#######################

This time I got better numbers just changing from PHP to Python.
Using HTTP in python, I got roughly 96 objs/sec (against 72 objs/sec in
php).
Using Protocol Buffers in python, I got roughly 175 objs/sec (not available
in php).

I also tried to run more than one process in python, with PB:
1 proc = 175 objs/sec
2 proc = 157 objs/sec (each)
3 proc = 124 objs/sec (each)

As we can see, using a new language and Protocol Buffers I can get much
better results. Unfortunately, I think those numbers are still too low
(considering that I'm using the Memory backend). Do you think we can get
better results?

And again, thank you for your support.
