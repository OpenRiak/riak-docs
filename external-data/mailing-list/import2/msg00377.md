Hi Chris,

Some things I keep in mind re. links:

-not specifically the total number of links but the total size in kb should be 
considered specifically in regards to the webmachine http interface. i think 
there are problems around 8KB.
-links are unidirectional. a > b != b > a
-links are singular 1 to 1 relationships

Regarding changing links... Riak does not have any multi transaction 
transactional semantics. Meaning each operation is atomic in and of itself and 
can not be made to be dependent on another operation. The catch to this rule is 
pre and post hooks which will trigger at the bucket level and not at the key 
level so you could do certain things. So if you have an architecture where 
links in one object need to be reflected in another object then you either need 
to account for that in your application or augment your application with some 
sort of message queue.

Regarding changing objects (keys) frequently you should familiarize yourself 
with the W and DW parameters which are all beholden to your N val set at the 
bucket level.

I would probably run multiple nodes on one physical machine. As with most 
databases, the bottleneck is usually in the I/O so keep that in mind contention 
wise. But be warned that as per some recent posts, Riak keeps multiple physical 
copies of your data on multiple vnodes. And there are some number of vnodes 
associated with physical nodes. So your data on disk will reflect that 
redundancy.

To the Basho people, it wasn't clear, but are there ways to ensure that 
duplicate copies are not housed on the same physical host?
