Hi guys,

I am very new to Riak and I am trying to run some benchmarks for our cluster

I saw this blog post about running basho bench distributed to be able to
get high throughput.
https://medium.com/@mustwin/benchmarking-riak-bfee93493419

I also found the example config that can run in distributed mode, but when
I try to run it:

./basho\_bench examples/riakc\_pb\_distributed.config, I get the message:
"Basho bench not started in distributed mode, and distribute\_work = true"

Is there some documentation no how to run basho bench distributed?


Thanks,

Mohamed
