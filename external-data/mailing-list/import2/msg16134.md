Hey Daniel,

It appears that the domain buckets api does not support headOnly(). That
api was written to be a higher-level abstraction around a common usage, so
it abstracted that idea of head vs object data away. If you need that
support, I would use the regular bucket methods instead.

Thanks,
Alex
