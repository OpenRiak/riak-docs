Hi Jeff,

I think this is covered by a feature I'm adding, if I understand what you're 
asking for. Does this example give you the values you want?

Say in current riak the query you might do would be

curl localhost:8098/buckets/your\_bucket/index/catalog\_bin/1000/2000

would get you a list of keys. In 1.4 there'll be the option to get the index 
values as well, so the results would be an array of pairs like {results: 
["1001" : "primary\_key"]} where the first element is the value of catalog\_bin 
index and the second the primary key of the object.

Is that what you're asking for?

Cheers

Russell
