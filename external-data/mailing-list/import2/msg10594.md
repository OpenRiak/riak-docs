Hi list,

I have a non-trivial map reduce query which traverses links between objects
across several map phases, constructing a composite object enroute. One of
our links is one-to-many, so I use a reduce phase to flatten my set of
objects at the end.

Would a query of this type be better done as a smaller M/R query to get the
base set of objects, and then multiple concurrent gets for the related
objects? Is it sensible to do map reduce jobs with many map and reduce
phases?

I appreciate this question is somewhat open ended, but any input would be
welcome.
