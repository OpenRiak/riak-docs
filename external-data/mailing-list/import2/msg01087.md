ok, my ring seems ok now.
what i did was to change the rel/vars/dev[1,2,3]\_vars.config file.
in there i was just replacing the ips...
this reip thing did not really work out ...

here is my riak ring now:

i am using 0.12.1 on my mac and 0.12 on both vms. i have now a set of 100.000 
entrys like this (just for testing):
{"id":"42164", "actionTime":"2007-05-11 17:08:55", "action":"some action", 
"res":"7024", "user":"5", "client":"2787"}


and my mr job looks like this (just for testing):
{"inputs":"actionbucket",
 "query":[
 {"map":{"language":"javascript", "source":
 "function(values, keyData, arg) {
 
 var value = Riak.mapValuesJson(values)[0];
 if(value.reservation == '4084'){
 return [value];
 }
 return [];
 }","keep":true}}
 ],"timeout": 900000
}


the beam instances are all showing on "top" now, and there is some traffic 
going back and forth. (~200kb / s)

but this job takes like 1:30 min.

i know that this is not really comparable with a mysql query because you can do 
more calculations in the mr job to produce much more special results and the mr 
job has a ~linear "worktime"... but ~1:30 min is still pretty bad .... 

is there any way to do much better ?

best regards
nils
