The only reason is that if the HW dies we will have to import the data again

That's why i would prefer 2 nodes setup

Is it stable enough ?
Form the website :
NOTICE: Yokozuna is in alpha stage. It is under active development. Breaking 
changes could occur at any moment. In a future release it will replace Riak

2i indexes are not critical part tho.

We just want to be able to fetch keys fast from riak ( with low cuncurrency )
