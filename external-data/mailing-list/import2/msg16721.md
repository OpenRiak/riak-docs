Sad to say your LOG files suggest the same bug as seen elsewhere and fixed by 
recent changes in the leveldb code.

The tougher issue is that the fixes are currently only available for our 2.0 
product series. A backport would be non-trivial due to the number of places 
changed between 1.4 and 2.0 and the number of places the fix overlaps those 
changes. The corrected code is tagged “2.0.9” in eleveldb and leveldb.

The only path readily available to you is to have your receiving cluster 
upgraded to 2.0 Riak CS and manually build/patch eleveldb to the 2.0.9 version. 
Then start your handoffs. (eleveldb version 2.0.9 is not present in any 
shipping version of Riak … yet). 

I will write again if I can think of an easier solution. But nothing is 
occurring to me or the team members I have queried.
