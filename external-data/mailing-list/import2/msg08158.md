Hi Boris,

My comments are inline.

Nothing has changed in regards to querying multiple indexes. I.e. only one
index can be queried.

Do you really want to use term\_to\_binary here? Perhaps you could get away
with a binary with a known separator like <<"new\_gloves">> or
<<"new|gloves">> etc. It should save a few bytes per object over external
term format.

If you go this route make sure to query on the more limiting index so MR
can process the least amount of objects. Each object needed by MR is
random access.

Perhaps, that all depends on your problem. The data model, how often data
is updated, the types of queries you need to perform, how much data you
have, what kind of latency requirements you have, etc. Feel free to
elaborate more.
