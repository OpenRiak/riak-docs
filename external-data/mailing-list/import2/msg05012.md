Yeah, I thought so... it would be nice though to be able to search across 
different buckets. i.e. lookup services for equities across different 
investment universes etc.

Roberto,
I do not believe this is possible through a single call because you need to 
explicitly define the bucket to search in and it does not (at least that I have 
seen) accept an array or list of buckets. That said, I guess you could do 
something that makes several calls but that is not what you really want to do.
