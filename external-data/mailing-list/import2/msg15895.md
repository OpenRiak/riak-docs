[Excuse the repeat - here it is in plaintext] 

Hello Riakators! 

Welcome back to The Recap. We're trying out another new format this week. 
 
## Feedback 
The first change you'll notice is that we're going with plaintext this time. Do 
you like it? Do you prefer Markdown? 
\* Give a definitive answer in this 3 question survey: 
https://surveyplanet.com/5501f6ac52dada35360b26a5

 
## Important announcements 
We've had two advisories worth noting: 
\* Advisory in response to POODLE security concern 
\* Advisory for 2.0.4 and Map Data Type Disk Incompatibility 
 
Both are available here: 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/community/product-advisories/
