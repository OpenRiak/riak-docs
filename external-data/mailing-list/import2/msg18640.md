Given the following configuration, can anyone explain to me what the 
object\_lager\_event section does?

I see this code all over the place (including snippets I provided in the 
distant past).

However, a search on github (basho org/erlang-lager/lager) don’t throw up any 
code/module matches.

(GitHub indexing doesn’t work well as GitHub only index master and basho stuff 
is a mess branch wise).

Anyone got any idea ?

[
{lager,
 [
 {extra\_sinks,
 [
 {object\_lager\_event,
 [{handlers,
 [{lager\_file\_backend,
 [{file, "/var/log/riak/object.log"},
 {level, info},
 {formatter\_config, [date, " ", time," [",severity,"] 
",message, "\n"]}
 ]
 }]
 },
 {async\_threshold, 500},
 {async\_threshold\_window, 50}]
 }
 ]
 }
 ]
}].

Thanks,

Bryan
