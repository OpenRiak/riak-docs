Hey, 


Congrats on new release!


I'm considering porting our search engine to riak-search. We're currently using 
Solr and are quite happy with it except for indexing times where riak could 
probably be much faster.


Our requirements:
- faceting
- float fields
- multi-value fields
- date fields 
- sorting by floats and dates 
- fast updates
- dynamic fields 
- stemmed/unstemmed string fields (useful to get good data from faceting)


AFAIK you support dynamic fields, faceting and date fields. What about other 
points?


Thanks!


Sebastjan
