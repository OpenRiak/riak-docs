Hi Rusty ,

Thanks

I already tried. :) but it give error and trying to teach me sytnax as in help 
:) 

It is accepting : bin/search-cmd solr testwiki /root/DATA/output/ 

but gives error for : 

bin/search-cmd solr testwiki /root/DATA/output/\*.xml 

As you aware We are trying to do some benchmark test on riaksearch. We have 
customers have billions of doc. Working with current lucene / Solr is a 
operational nightmare ( yes it is).

So we are looking for a replacement for those customers. This is why we are one 
of the early tester of the RiakSearch. 

Best Regards

Prometheus
