Hi everybody,

I'm new to Riak-CS and just joined the group.

We've been exploring Riak-CS now for a couple of days and consider it as a
potential inhouse-alternative to external S3-based storage providers.

Given the last commit was in January 2016, the question rose as to how well
the project is supported and how mature the solution is.

I'd be very thankful for any comments from the community on this.


Best regards

Stefan
