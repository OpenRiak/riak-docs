Hi Ryan

Thanks for helping out!!

The cluster consists of 4 exactly similar nodes - all dedicated to riak use 
only - no other zones or tasks going on. We use Riak-EE 0.13. The servers is HP 
servers with 4 x 146GB 10K RPM SAS disks. There is a memorycache on the RAID 
controller and it is used during both read and writes but the RAID iis built 
usin Solaris-10u9 ZFS in a setup as such:

 pool: pool01
 state: ONLINE
 scrub: scrub completed after 0h0m with 0 errors on Tue Oct 26 21:25:05 2010
config:

 NAME STATE READ WRITE CKSUM
 pool01 ONLINE 0 0 0
 mirror-0 ONLINE 0 0 0
 c0t0d0s7 ONLINE 0 0 0
 c0t1d0s7 ONLINE 0 0 0
 mirror-1 ONLINE 0 0 0
 c0t2d0 ONLINE 0 0 0
 c0t3d0 ONLINE 0 0 0

errors: No known data errors

metrics during load gives 5% CPU load and about 10% IO load (iostat reports 30 
iops and the disks should be able to handle 300 iops each). So basically, the 
servers is unloaded....

One question remains - we use ZFS with default blocksize of 128Kb - what is the 
optimal blocksize with bitcask?

But I believe, that we should look somewhere else for the challenge - the 
hardware is not loaded significant, so I suspect, that we have a faulty 
datamodel or usage...?

Best regards,

Karsten
