I've run into a problem with Riak freezing completely on one node running
on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a XEN VM (EC2). If I ssh into the node and run "ps
ax" that shell session also freezes. I also tried another ssh session with
"netstat -lnp" to see if I could find the process ID to kill, but that also
froze.

I must admit that I have seen a similar problem with RabbitMQ running on
Ubuntu 10 LTS on a an OpenVPS VM a few years ago.

I suppose this is an Erlang issue of some sort, but I would really like
some way to kill the Riak processes without a reboot if possible.
