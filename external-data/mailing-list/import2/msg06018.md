I'm seeing an issue where running the same index query multiple times
against an unchanging set of data returns a differing numbers of items.
Riak error and crash logs are empty.

I've seen this on my dev machine (haven't noticed it in production, but it
could be happening). The production cluster is running Riak 1.0.2 and my
dev machine is running 1.0 (96d0b8011 from Oct 6) compiled from source. The
data on my dev machine is an import of the data from production (via
riak-admin backup/restore).

Anyone seen this issue? Help on debugging the cause appreciated.
