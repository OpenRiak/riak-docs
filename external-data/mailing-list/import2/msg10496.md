Hi,

At a glance, it looks like the basho\_bench node couldn't start correctly
with a longname.
How are you starting basho\_bench?

This issue could be due to a misconfiguration in the hostname for your
machine.
How do your /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname look like?

For information about shortnames and longnames in Erlang:
