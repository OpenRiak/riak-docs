Thanks Kevin,
Is there a way to set a default N (and R/W) value across a cluster via
configuration? I know there's a default\_props feature in configuration but
I don't know if it's possible to use that for default N/R/W values and I
don't know what the syntax is.

In case anyone was wondering I went ahead and tried a backup/restore between
production and test and it worked just fine. Restoring from a backup file
will work across different clusters.
