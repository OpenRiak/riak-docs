Hi Ryan,

Thanks, the number of objects between (xxxxxx1, yyyyyy9x) could be huge, as
you said, I would rather not to do the filter.

The expected objects returned should be hundreds and the total objects
would be 200millions. I guess the search would be slower than 2i query,
even compared to 10 range queries.

Thanks

Sean
