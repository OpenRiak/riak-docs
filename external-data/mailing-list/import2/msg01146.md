Riak Recap for 9/24 - 9/26

1) Riak-js, the node.js client for Riak with HTTP and Protocol Buffers
support, just got some updates. The 0.3 beta just landed in master.

Project site ---> http://riakjs.org/
Github Repo ---> http://github.com/frank06/riak-js

As an aside, a big thanks should go out to @frank06 and the Widescript
team, @technoweenie, @siculars, @botanicus, and @freshtonic for
hacking on this awesome client.

2) @technoweenie (Rick Olson) gave a preso at last week's Riak Meetup
in San Francisco. His talk was entitled, "Git vs Riak: Battle Royale."

Slides are here ---> http://git-vs-riak-sf.heroku.com/#1

3) Q --- Is there any hosted riak instances like mongohq and couchone?
(from jamescarr via #riak)

 A --- Yes. Through Joyent. Check this out --->

4) Q --- Is there anything special that I need to do to use ripple
with Sinatra, or should it be pretty easy to get started? (from
peschkaj via #riak)

 A --- With Sinatra you'll have to set the configuration yourself,
either when creating the Riak::Client object, or if you're using
Ripple (document models), set Ripple.config=.

Example: Ripple.config =
YAML.load\_file(::File.expand\_path("../../config/ripple.yml",
\_\_FILE\_\_))[ENV['RACK\_ENV']]
