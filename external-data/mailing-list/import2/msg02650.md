Ok, that's fair (you're basically describing a CQRS-style architecture). But I 
don't see anything in that chain of processing that requires your individual 
Map and Reduce functions to be written in PHP or Python. The munging you 
describe would probably be best done outside Riak, either via a custom system, 
or via something like Hadoop's streaming interface. One thing that might be of 
interest to you is Disco, which is written primarily in Python with some bits 
of Erlang, and is an alternative to Hadoop.
