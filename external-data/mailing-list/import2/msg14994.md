If you can help us what goal is trying to be achieved by taking that
approach, perhaps we can refute the logic (or find a better solution). It
sounds suspiciously like someone is trying to avoid the complexities of
siblings and conflict resolution (a goal which your architecture doesn't
actually achieve).

If the argument can't be won, at least use a load balancer (software like
haproxy would do fine) in front of riak1 for writes so that you can
redirect traffic in the case of a node failure.

However, seriously, if your company is willing to sacrifice write
availability, Riak probably isn't the best choice. Riak's tradeoffs are
oriented around making certain it remains available even with network and
server failures; if you don't need high availability, making those
tradeoffs is usually not worth the trouble.
