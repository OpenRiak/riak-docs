We have a 5 node Riak cluster running 2.1.1. This morning FSM Time (99th 
percentile) went way up. We couldn't find any clear signs of trouble with the 
cluster and ultimately chose to move the data files and restart the nodes. Once 
we started with an empty DB, the FSM Time normalized. But now it's headed back 
up again. We're stumped on how to trouble shoot this issue. Any suggestions?
