Not to jump to conclusions, but this sounds like a quorum issue.
Such as your writes are not going to all three servers, but only to one or two.
Handoffs would occur when nodes went down unexpectedly, it doesn't
ever attempt to fetch unwritten data, it fetches data from other
servers which were still up at the point the server went down..
There are some configuration values you could experiment with, that
will ok a write only as long as its gone to a durable storage count..
But keep in mind theres no guarantee vnodes are assigned to unique
servers..
