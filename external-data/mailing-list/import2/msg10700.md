Hi Dave, 


Building on what Engel said, the stats change was merged as part of a larger 
squashed commit [1].

Hi Dave, 


The stats calculation was fixed in 1.3.1, but the read-repair with 
Last-write-wins=true was not backported. That one will make it to 1.4, which is 
scheduled in the near future. I hope that helps.

Hi Jared, 


I don't see these patches, which I have applied to our installation of 1.3, 
explicitly mentioned in the Release Notes: 


Fix bug where stats endpoints were calculating \_all\_ riak\_kv stats: 
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/blob/9be3405e53acf680928faa6c70d265e86c75a22c/src/riak\_kv\_stat\_bc.erl
 



Every read triggers a read-repair when Last-write-wins=true 
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/334 


Can you confirm whether or not they made it into 1.3.1, please?

I hesitate to reply to my own email, but just wanted to point out that this 
issue https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/pull/281 listed in the release notes 
should help all of you who had issues with slow bitcask startup times in 1.3.0. 
If you see or don't see improvements let us know. 


Thanks, 
Jared
