I have no idea about this. From glancing at Luwak's public API, there's nothing 
there to provide any form of tunable consistency. You could dig into the Luwak 
code and see if you can change it up to require W or DW to be equal to N.

I think your best bet is to go with Alex's suggestion and build a retry 
capability into your client.

As with any technical decision, though, take a step back and ask yourself "What 
problem am I trying to solve?" Once you identify that, ask yourself "Can I buy 
something right now that solves my problem?" And finally, "Does it make sense 
to code around it when there might be something else that solves my problem?"
