Hey Jon,

A webcast (or better yet a series of webcasts) on riak\_core is a great
idea, and something we've been talking about producing. Guess we'll
just have to move a bit faster :) The first one will probably be an
overview of how to build a simple app with riak\_core.

Time permitting, we'll try and get some more content out there around
core. What else would you like to see?

Mark
