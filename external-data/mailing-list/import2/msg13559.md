Hello

1) Has anyone had any success with integrating the java-riak-client with
Spring?

2) How do you use the 'com.basho.riak.pbc.RiakConnectionPool' with Spring?
Is it required if you're using nginx TCP load balancing. I'm confused in how
to use load-balancing with connection-pooling. What is considered best
practice?

3) How do you ensure that a connection is correctly shutdown()?

4) Is a 'com.basho.riak.client.bucket.Bucket' thread-safe or should I fetch
a Bucket per request?

5) Why does the java-riak-client (1.4.4) not support Riak Search? Should I
use 'spring-data-solr' - has anyone had any succcess with integrating this
project with Riak?

Thanks

Mark
