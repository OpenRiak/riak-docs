Adam,

It seems totally reasonable to add an additional key after authentication
from some other social network; that key being named with a unique
identifier from the external social network and linking to or otherwise
referencing your internal user profile information. You could then choose
to either keep a link from your internal profile keys to the network profile
keys, or simply merge the incoming profile information from the social
network into your internal version and track their identifiers separately.
