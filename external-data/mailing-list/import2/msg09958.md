Anton,

I don't see any reason why this can't be fixed. However, since I'm not
familiar with the specifics of the JSON implementation, I'll need
assistance. Please open an issue or pull-request on the Python client:
https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/issues. We are open to
major, breaking changes for the next release.
