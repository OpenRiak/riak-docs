Hi Jeremy,

Yes, riak-admin backup reads all data, iterating through each vnode, to
create the backup file. To restore, it performs a normal put operation for
each object.

Can you run 'du -k' within the ./data/eleveldb directory on your dev node.
This will list the size of each vnode directory. I'd like to check that
each vnode has data in it, and that the vnodes are roughly the same size.
(There will be some variation due to how LevelDB compacts data, of course.)

Also, have you changed any of the default bucket settings in production or
on your dev machine? Is there anything that is different from the defaults?

Best,
Rusty
