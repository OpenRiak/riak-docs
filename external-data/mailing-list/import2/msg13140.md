First, make sure Riak is working properly, `riak-admin test` will do a
get/put cycle to make sure your cluster is ok.

Second, double-check what the protobuffs port is in your config file,
usually 8087.

The pb\_backlog will only be a problem when you are rapidly opening
connections to the server, although we are bumping up the default to 128
for Riak 2.0.

Other than those initial guesses, this might be a problem in the library.
Can you post the code you are using?
