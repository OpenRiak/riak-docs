Hey Joe,

I will do my best to help, but I am not the most experienced with Riak
operations. Your best bet to get to a solution as fast as possible is to
include the full users group, which I have added to the recipients of this
message.

1. Are the Riak data directories within Vagrant shared directories between
the host and guest? I have had issues with OS file system caching before
when working with web server files.

2. What version of Ubuntu are you using?

3. How did you install Riak on Ubuntu?

4. Have you tried restoring the original distribution riak.conf file and
seen if the issue persists? This would help you determine if the issue is
your config or something with your environment.
