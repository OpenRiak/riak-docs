Hi Germain,

It's difficult to say if 3 GB of RAM is not enough. Bitcask maintains an in
memory structure called a keydir. The bitcask intro describes the keydir as
follows:

"A keydir is simply a hash table that maps every key in a Bitcask to a
fixed-size structure giving the file, offset, and size of the most recently
written entry for that key"

This means that the amount of memory used by Riak depends on how many keys
you have and the size of each key. So if you have lots of keys you may run
out memory.

How much is the riak process consuming before you request the key list for
the bucket?

Thanks,
Dan
