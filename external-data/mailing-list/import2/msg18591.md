Hi,

Can someone please point me out to the guide explaining how to change 
wants and choose claim functions for Riak distribution % distribution?


We would like to set these permanently and trigger a cluster 
redistribution, I just can't find that documentation anymore, I was able 
to find this but I can't remember how to use it:

|{wants\_claim\_fun,{riak\_core\_claim,wants\_claim\_v3}},{choose\_claim\_fun,{riak\_core\_claim,choose\_claim\_v3}}|


Kind regards,
Guido.
