Henning,

Yes, the Java client is designed to be used across multiple threads.
Instantiate it once and share it.

As you noted, there's options in the configuration for tuning the
internal connection pool. The client maintains a pool of connections
to the Riak node so that multi-threaded applications aren't creating a
new connection every time an operation is performed.

Thanks,
- Roach
