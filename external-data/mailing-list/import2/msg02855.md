Just wondering what the recommended approach is to developing commit hooks 
written in Erlang? I'm trying to start with a separate project that just has 
dependencies on riak\_kv (because of riak\_object).

Or should I be developing my modules within the Riak source tree? Like 
deps/my\_module/[src,include,ebin,etc...]?

Thanks!
