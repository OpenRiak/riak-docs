Hi everybody!

I want to index documents into a riak\_search index from a distant erlang
node using the erlang search api. For the moment, I use the rpc:call()
function to do this, is there a better mean to perform such operation
without passing throug rpc:call() (perhaps using the riak client or other
thing), but from the erlang node (I don't want to use the http api)?


By the way, can someone give me an example about how to use an erlang
function for a mapred\_saerch map/reduce.

thank you!
