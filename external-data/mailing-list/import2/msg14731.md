Hi Marcel,

What is the configured ring size for this cluster?

You can slow down the transfers by running $ riak-admin transfer-limit 1 in
one of your riak nodes. iowait should decrease as well once transfer-limit
is lowered, unless one of your disks is failing or is about to fail.


Regards,
Ciprian
