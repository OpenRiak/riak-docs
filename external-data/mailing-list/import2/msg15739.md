Hi all,
I'm getting into a scenario where I'd like to use a secondary index on a 
particular field in my riak object/data. However the value of the field might 
change albeit very very rarely. So I was thinking I could just reindex using 
the new value. What's the right syntax to delete and add a new secondary index? 
A map-reduce approach would be great. I wouldn't mind a better alternative 
though.
Thanks in advance
PS: I am using riak with node.js (riakjs)
Jose
