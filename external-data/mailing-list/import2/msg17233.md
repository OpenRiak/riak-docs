Satish -

Thanks for the info. Did you install the Basho-packaged Riak or build
it yourself?

If you built it yourself, I suspect you are running into this issue:
https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/267

Fix is here: https://gist.github.com/vinoski/4689170

Please remember to use "reply all" so that the riak-users list may
gain from our debugging.
