Hello Friends,


For your reading enjoyment this weekend we bring you the Basho Academy a
community client library and, as always, the mailing list recap.


As always, don’t be shy, let us know your thoughts. If you’re working on or
speaking about something Riak related and would like a mention. I’ll get
your talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap. I have connections.


## Announcements



 -

 Basho is pleased to bring you the Basho Academy [0], a series of self
 paced, tutorial style lessons on Riak development and administration. In a
 blog post [1], Justin Pease walks through the motivation for developing the
 Basho Academy and what to expect from the Academy going forward.
 -

 Luke Bakken released Riak Python Client 2.5.5 [2][3]. This fixes a long
 standing issue with multi-get and multi-put operations where the thread
 pool did not shut down cleanly when the interpreter shuts down. Remember
 to "close()" your RiakClient instances to ensure cleanup [4].



## Community Code and Walkthroughs



 -

 Jason Voegele will be giving a talk entitled “Dialyzer: Optimistic Type
 Checking for Erlang and Elixir” [5] at ElixirConf [6] in Orlando, FL Aug 31
 - Sept 2.
 -

 Drew Kerrigan updates the community driven Riak Elixir Client adding
 Riak TS support [7].

## Recently Answered



 -

 Travis Kirstine writes in with a question [12] on ram utilization in
 bitcask. Luke Bakken points out that the bitcask calculator [13] outputs a
 minimum ram requirement. Riak and your OS will happily eat ram as load
 increases. Noms.

 objects [14]. Alex Moore and Russell Brown offer some guidance.

 Solr which has this feature.
 -
