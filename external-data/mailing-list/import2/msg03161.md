Luc,

that was indeed a bug in riak-js, but it has been fixed in a recent commit [1], 
which I just verified to give the expected results.

Quickest workaround to get it working locally is to clone the repository, have 
CoffeeScript installed, and then run the following commands in the repository's 
directory:

$ cake build
$ npm install
