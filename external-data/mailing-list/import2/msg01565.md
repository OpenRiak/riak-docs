Riak Recap for Nov. 15 - 17

1) J. Brisbin pushed code for MapReduce, links and Etag-based caching
for Riak in Spring Data.

Latest changes here ---> https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-keyvalue

2) Gavin Carr wrote up a blog post called "Exploring Riak." It's based
on his evaluation for Riak as a large "brackup" datastore. Definitely
worth the read.

Thanks, Gavin!

3) O.J. Reeves (@TheColonial), who has authored some fantastic blog
posts on Erlang Web Development , was recently on the "Coding By
Numbers" podcast. He was interviewed about, among other things, his
forays into learning Erlang. Riak and a few other pieces of Basho
software are mentioned around the 27 minute mark.

And for those of you who haven't checked out his blog series on Erlang
Web Dev, you should do so here --->

Thank, OJ!

4) Daniel Lindsley (@daniellindsley) put together an exceptional blog
post called, "Getting Started With Riak & Python" over on the
Pragmatic Badger Blog. This post is extensive, and is packed with code
examples and benchmarks. In other word, read it (even if Python isn't
your preferred programming language).

Thanks, Daniel!

5) Q --- Are requests for non-existent bucket/keys expensive in any
weird way? (from jmayfield via #riak )

 A --- No. It should be no more expensive than a lookup for an
existing object.

6) marcrosoft, bingeldac and benblack had a quick conversation in
#riak that started with "How do people typically come up with a naming
convention for keys?"

Gist here ---> https://gist.github.com/704394

7) nfo, mojito and seancribbs had a brief convo in #riak that started
with, "I'm trying to avoid 404s when I read an object I've just
created.If n\_val=3 and w=3, then the PUT request will respond only
when all copies are created, right ?"
