There has never been a guarantee of this; we don't support pipelining
of requests. Requests are sequential in that you should make a request
then wait for the reply before issuing another request on the same
connection.

Correct. This is what all the clients have always done.

The number of connections has always been largely irrelevant; make
1000 of them if you'd like ... just don't try to send 1000 operations
at once if the node can't handle it. The workload on the node is the
(far) greater limiting factor.
