Hi all,

I'm a total newbie with Riak so I apologize if my question is silly.

I need to build a POC with Riak and we have 5 nodes running v1.4 on a dev
box so the first thing I'm trying to do is to upgrade these nodes to v2.0
On the first node (dev1) I followed the instructions here:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/upgrading/rolling-upgrades/#Debian-Ubuntu

But when I get to step 5 "5. Verify Riak is running the new version" the
output of the "riak-admin status" command says 
/riak\_api\_version : <<"1.4.2-0-ga7e00e2">>
riak\_pipe\_version : <<"1.4.2-0-g59d1bae">>
riak\_core\_version : <<"1.4.2">>/

I tried a second time and now when I re-install the package with dpkg -i 
the output says
/(Reading database ... 52512 files and directories currently installed.)
\*Preparing to replace riak 2.0.0-1\* (using riak\_2.0.0-1\_amd64.deb) ...
Unpacking replacement riak ...
Setting up riak (2.0.0-1) ...
Processing triggers for man-db .../

So this makes me think it detects somehow that version 2.0.0-1 is running
but riak-admin still says 1.4.2... 

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for your help!
