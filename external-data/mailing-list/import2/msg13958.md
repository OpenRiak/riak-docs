Hi Michael,

At this time Basho can recommend ZFS on Solaris, SmartOS and OmniOS. Other
direct Solaris clones like IllumOS may be acceptable as well, but we do not
have direct experience with ZFS on those operating systems. ZFS on Linux is
still too early in the project lifetime to recommend for production use.
For instance, there are still reports of excessive memory use by ZFS on
Linux to be found via internet searches. ZFS on FreeBSD is more mature but
we have not done extensive performance and reliability testing with ZFS on
FreeBSD.

Thanks!
