There is not currently any client that uses strategy #2 of partition-awareness.

To make it practical, we would need to extend the client-facing
protocol so that an incoming client could ask to be redirected to an
"ideal" incoming node. This is quite doable, though would have the
downside of making such clients more complex and thus possibly more
fragile.
