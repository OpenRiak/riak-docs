Hello,

I am trying to evaluate / run some tests on a 4 mil dataset.
I have 2 nodes setup (different machines - 8GB ram each, I7 cpus).
10 MB connection between them.

I am trying to insert data into riak using w=1 and dw=1 (also tried with dw
= 0, w = 0).
For each risk object i have 4 indexes (2 binary 2 int).
Riak backend is leveldb.

I can't get more than 300 inserts per second.
I have also tried running 2 threads each hitting the different node.
Nothing changed too much.

Is this normal behavior ?
