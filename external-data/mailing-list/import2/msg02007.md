Hello.

Nobody answered my previous post
(http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2010-December/002632.html).
But I'll try again...

I made different stress-test.

One hardware server â€” 2\*quad-core Xeon E5620, 2.40 GHz, 48Gb RAM,
RAID1 (linux softraid, 2 sata disks).
Debian GNU/Linux squeeze

Installed erlang R14. Compiled riak from sources.

sys\_system\_version : <<"Erlang R14B (erts-5.8.1) [source] [64-bit]
[smp:16:16] [rq:16] [async-threads:64] [kernel-poll:true]">>
sys\_system\_architecture : <<"x86\_64-pc-linux-gnu">>

Configured 3 riak instances (no OpenVZ at this time) and joined each
other into a ring.

Then I put 50 objects (average size 2-18kB) into riak. And started a
stress test: about 5\*10 requests (via REST) simultaneously to
random-selected objects within 300 seconds. Requests has been made to
all 3 instances via load-balancing HTTP proxy (nginx). Used
multi-mechanize
(http://code.google.com/p/multi-mechanize/) to make the stress-test.

Got pretty good perfomance and two very bad throughput slowdowns. You
can see results here:

Again: can you help me to eliminate that perfomance downfalls?
