Release Candidate 5 for 2.9.0 is now available on github. It is available
to build from source here - https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0rc5
.

Apologies for the churn of release candidates on 2.9.0. This is as a
result of issues discovered in the leveled refactoring in RC2, having
side-effects during big handoff events with high transfer limits.

All usual caveats arise. This is a release intended for testing in
non-production environments.

Apologies for the ongoing delays getting this release through the test
process.

Regards

Martin

P.S. A reminder that work on Release 3.0 is progressing, with a workshop
being held this week to try and accelerate progress. Follow the
