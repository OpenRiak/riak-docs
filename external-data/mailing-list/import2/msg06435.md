It's very much possible to implement limited range queries that return
continuations or allow you to specify offset. I wrote an implementation
myself [1] for fun a while back (first version used client side
continuations and second allowed to pass offset). When something like this
will be on the roadmap I am not sure.

May I suggest voicing your request here as well:
