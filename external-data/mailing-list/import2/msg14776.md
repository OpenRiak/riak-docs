Hi guys,

I was wondering if streaming the keys using 2i would be possible. I guess
any way of limiting the number of keys returned would be good.

According to the documentation there few options:

http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/2i/#Examples

- streaming the keys
- pagination with max\_results

Is any of these available in the Erlang client?

Thank you in advance,
Istvan
