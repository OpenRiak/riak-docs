Thanks, that's interesting to hear.
How have you been finding the stability and reliability to be with
leofs, over time?


I still wish I could just get our Riak CS cluster performing better;
it just seems so unreasonably slow at the moment, that I suspect
there's \*something\* holding it back. I can build a test cluster on my
desktop, and even with five virtual riak nodes on the one machine, I
still see 20-40x the performance, so it seems bizarre that dedicated
bare-metal servers would be so slow. (Although obviously there's much
more network latency between real machines, than a virtual cluster on
one desktop; and they have a lot more data in their bitcask databases)


However I've tried fiddling with all the Riak and Riak CS options..
ethtool offloads.. mount options.. sysctls.. MTU sizes.. even dropping
single nodes out of the cluster one at a time in case they were
somehow at fault.. seems like the only performance changes I can make
are negative.

We're still double the speed of the original poster in this thread,
but.. that isn't saying much.
