Sambit:

If you change the `nodename` on a node after starting it, you will create a 
condition where the node will no longer be able to find its name in the ring at 
startup and the startup will fail. If this is a single node cluster, you can 
just wipe the contents of `/var/lib/riak/ring` and a new ring will be 
generated. If you need to do this for multiple nodes, I would encourage you to 
review http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/nodes/renaming/ 
 which is fairly 
exhaustive on the subject of renaming nodes.

Hope this gets you back up and going,
