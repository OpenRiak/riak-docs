That assumes a consistent conflict resolution strategy for all objects in
the bucket (which makes sense under most circumstances I suppose).

I personally like the statebox approach, but you can't please everyone and
it doesn't apply to all possible situations. On the down side that kind of
implementation ends up pushing 'code' into your data objects (the allowed
operations).

For simplicity's sake, I'd leave out conflict resolution until the rest of
the code is done :)

Cheers,

Mark
