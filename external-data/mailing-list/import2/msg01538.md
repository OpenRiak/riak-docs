I agree. But still good to know to be fully informed about the risks involved 
when choosing a small n\_val with large, write-heavy datasets on few nodes :)

I just had a look and I see a slightly different exception: 
On riak01 (which had been sending out data, and subsequently shut down):

ERROR: "Handoff receiver for partition ~p exiting abnormally after processing 
~p objects: ~p\n" - [ 0,
{ noproc, 
 {gen\_fsm,
 sync\_send\_all\_state\_event,
 [<0.24196.2404>,
 {handoff\_data, 
 <<...binary...>>
 },
 60000]}}]

Nothing interesting that I can see on the receiving end(s).

I see, this wasn't clear to me. This was then probably what caused everything 
to get off track. 
I think I'll throw away the test cluster then and start over, this time not 
just waiting for ringready. Maybe this should be mentioned more prominently in 
the documentation alongside the description of riak-admin ringready. Having a 
"settled ring" implied to me that it's ok to proceed with topology changes :)
