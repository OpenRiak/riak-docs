Hey everyone! As always, there's been some great knowledge sharing over the
user lists. Here is your biweekly Recap!

Note that many of the "unanswered" are brand new and I know we'll get to
answering them. I just want you all to know we keep track of these.

## Announcements
\* There's a new Java client in town! 2.0.2 was released [0]

## Recently Answered
\* Roman asks about using a FQDN and is guided to use 0.0.0.0 instead [1]
\* The Riak C client ran into a segfault that Chris explained [2]
\* Humberto found setting ulimit on OS X is a little tricky [3]
\* I gave Sevilha some resources to spin up Riak locally [4]
\* Zeeshan makes sense of indexing Riak Data Types for Marius [5]

## New and Unanswered
\* Damien needs some help thinking through ring-resizing on a live cluster
[6]
\* Sean gets an error while deleting an object through the Erlang client [7]
\* Humberto could still use help with ulimit settings on OS X [8]
\* Nick is helping Johan with a known Erlang bug in need of a patch [9]
\* Damien sees 2i writes when he isn't using 2i. Any idea why? [10]
\* Amao sees an outbound handoff error and still needs some help [11]

## All the Meetups!
We've been busy on the meetup scene, hosting events in Portland, Austin and
Chicago. If you'd like to see where groups are, we have a new URL to do so
[12]. Let me know if you'd like to run one in your city!

## What'd we miss?
Have you brought Riak into production at a new place? Did you find a blog
or presentation helpful? Good! Share it in our release notes:
