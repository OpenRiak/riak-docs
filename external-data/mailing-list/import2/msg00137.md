Hi Mark,

The python client received a significant refactor today thanks to Silas 
Sewell. It is now more pythonic and can be installed with a setup.py 
file. riak.py got moved into riak/\_\_init\_\_.py as part of that.


I'm not sure what bitbucket is up to, but a clean pull worked for me.

riak.py appears to have been removed about 9 hours ago. Bitbucket 
won't display the change set


This changeset can not be displayed, as it is too large (cutoff was at 
81.1 KB).

Are there any speed comparisons between riak and Cassandra?

Tthere aren't any at the moment, but this is something we are 
interested in working on

How can I get the Python client?

 This page:
 https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Client+Libraries#ClientLibraries-Python
 says to
 lookhttp://hg.basho.com/riak/src/tip/client\_lib/python/riak.py but
 that link returns a 404

Thanks for pointing out the broken link, we will fix that. You can 
grab the most recent Python client here:


http://hg.basho.com/riak-python-client

The client supports both HTTP and protobuffs protocols, but you will 
need to be running the latest tip or .10rc2 release to use the 
protobuffs protocol. By the end of the week .10 will be released and 
you should be able to use that version as well.




I'm guessing there is no C/C++ client since I didn't see one listed.

No, there isn't currently a C/C++ client, but one is in the works.



Is anyone using this thing to store 30,000 500 byte entries/second?

It is theoretically possible given good infrastructure and application 
design, but those numbers are on the very high end of current usage 
numbers.
