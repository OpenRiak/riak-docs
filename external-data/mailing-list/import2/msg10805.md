Hi List,

I've got one question regarding the AAE hashtrees located in the 
"anti\_entropy" folder.

Are these files relevant for a daily Riak backup?
I assume they're re-generated if they are missing so it should be safe 
to exclude the whole anti\_entropy directory in my backup archive.
Is this assumption correct or should I include the AAE hashtrees in my 
daily backup run?


Best
