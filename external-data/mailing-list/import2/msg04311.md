Jeremiah, with all the feedback indicating Riak to not be such a straight
fit for the problem even accepting batching compromises, I'll have to
strongly reconsider RDBMs solutions, though they come with their own
tradeoffs, as discussed here today. How about storing data using innostore
instead of bitcask, would this be a "best of both worlds" situation?

Thanks for these and the previous valuable comments, again,

Paul
