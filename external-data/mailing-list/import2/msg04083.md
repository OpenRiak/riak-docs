for PHP you can take a look at this slides i made, is about "phpCloud Framework" a new PHP5 MVC framework i'm building with Riak integration in place : ) is based on CakePHP that borrows heavily on Ruby on Rails. You can download the slides on this address ( seems the file is too big for the distribution list as my last mail couldn't be sent ):http://mahalostudio.com/Riak\_phpCloud.pptxRohman

It's awesome for ad-hoc querying, at least. An example can better explain. Consider this: db.add('users').map('query', '.address .street where
.weight:expr(x !.expired').run()

 as opposed to: db.add('users').map(function(v) {  v = Riak.mapValuesJson(v)[0];  var result = [];  if ((v.weight < 180 || v.exempt) && v.acl && v.acl.state === '1101' && !v.expired) {    if (v.address) {      result.push(v.address.street);    }  }  return result; }).run() riak-ql is basically adding some query sugar (where, &&) on top of JSONSelect... which you can try it out here:http://jsonselect.org/#tryit 2011/7/25 Mark Phillips :
