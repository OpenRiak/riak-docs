G'day!

Did you turn off and remove the Active Anti Entropy files before upgrading?

>From the 1.4.8 release notes:

IMPORTANT We recommend removing current AAE trees before upgrading. That
is, all files under the anti\_entropy sub-directory. This will avoid
potentially large amounts of repair activity once correct hashes start
being added. The data in the current trees can only be fixed by a full
rebuild, so this repair activity is wasteful. Trees will start to build
once AAE is re-enabled. To minimize the impact of this, we recommend
upgrading during a period of low activity.

Shane.
