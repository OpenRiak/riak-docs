No worries. And sorry about my tone if it was too strong. Responding
to emails before any coffee is not recommended. :)

Erlang can be a bit daunting to start, but once you dive in you'll
probably be hooked. (Don't say I didn't warn you.) If you're looking
for some Riak-related ways to test it out, there are a few contributed
erlang functions [1] that might be worth examining. Also, writing
riaknostic diagnostics [2] is an easy way to start learning. We're
also happy to help on this list where possible.

The docs have needed a lot of love for some time. There is a lot more
good stuff coming for docs, resources, etc. Glad you like them. Make
sure to tell us where they need some love.

Best,

Mark
