Hello, Riak users. We wanted to give you all a heads up that we have
just pulled a large changelog into the tip of the Riak repository. We
have been working on this list of changes privately, in order to cause
less confusion, as it covers a fairly major change, that was
experimental at first.

The big change is that we have split the 'riak' Erlang application
into two cooperating applications: 'riak\_core' and 'riak\_kv'. This
has both forced us to untangle some code, making interfaces cleaner,
as well as provided us with the ability to implement new functionality
on top of the clustering tools that Riak provides, without hacking
around the needs of the key/value store.

If you are interested in testing before the 0.10 release, please read
through the TRANSITION document included with the source. The most
important notes in there are the ones about changing your
configuration and ring file names.

If you're looking for the last updates just before this large change,
please pull the revision tagged "pre-0.10".

More details to come in the 0.10 release notes!

-The Basho Riak Team
