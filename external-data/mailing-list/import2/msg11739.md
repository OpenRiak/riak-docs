 Hi Brian,

Thanks for putting the release together so quickly. It does not appear as though the download is working (for the non maven files). It looks like there's some permissions issue (get an access denied).

Thanks.



 YN shared this with you.

 


Riak Java Client 1.1.2 and 1.4.0



 Via Nabble - Riak Users




 Greetings!
The Riak Java client versions 1.1.2 and 1.4.0 have been released and
are now available from maven central. For non-maven users a bundled
jar including all dependencies can be found for these versions at:
http://riak-java-client.s3.amazonaws.com/riak-client-1.4.0-jar-with-dependencies.jarhttp://riak-java-client.s3.amazonaws.com/riak-client-1.1.2-jar-with-dependencies.jarJavadoc is available via: http://basho.github.io/riak-java-client/Why two versions you ask? Good question.
The recently released Riak 1.4.0 adds a number of new features and
brings parity between our HTTP and Protocol Buffers APIs. The Java
client 1.4.0 reflects this by allowing PB operations that previously
would throw exceptions (setting bucket properties, for example) and
supports those new features. If you're using Riak 1.4, you want to be
using the Java client 1.4.x to use the new features.
1.1.2 on the other hand is a minor maintenance / bug fix release for
use with Riak 1.3.x and below. It will also work with Riak 1.4 but
does not support the new Riak 1.4 features.
Probably the most notable feature in 1.4.0 is support for the new
counters in Riak. Check out the Javadoc here:
