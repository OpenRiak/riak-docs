Afternoon, Evening, Morning to All -

Very short Recap for today.

Also, it's a holiday in the US on Monday, so I won't be writing a
Recap. If anyone out there wants to step up and compile it, that would
be great; expect a t-shirt if you embark on this very simple, 20
minute task. Otherwise, Recaps will resume on Wednesday.

Enjoy and have a great weekend.

2) We added an entry to the Knowledge Base about which system metrics
you should be monitoring when thinking about Riak memory usage.
