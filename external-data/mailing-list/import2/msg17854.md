Hi Toby,

If you put another user into the config, that's all it takes to make them
the admin user. There's no special value that's set in the database
itself. Any user can be an admin user, it doesn't even have to be the
first one created. It's just whatever user you have set in the config.

Kind Regards,
Shaun
