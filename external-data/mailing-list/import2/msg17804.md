Hello Riak Users

I have a use case where I would really like to list all keys of a bucket
despite all the warnings about performance. The number of keys is
relatively small - in the few thousands at the very most, Usually its no
more than 100

I also have other buckets in the same cluster that have millions of keys
and tens of tera bytes of data

Question: Will listing all keys on the small bucket adversely impact
performance of the other larger buckets?

Thanks
Arun
