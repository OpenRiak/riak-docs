Morning, Afternoon, Evening to all,

Firstly, apologies for going so long without a Recap. We just had a
holiday weekend here in the states and, on top of that, I've spent the
last few days moving to San Francisco, so things have been a bit
hectic to say the least. Regularly scheduled Recaps will be back
starting tomorrow. I promise.

Here is the Recap from the last several days. Enjoy.

Riak Recap for 7/2 - 7/7

1) For anyone in Oklahoma City and the surrounding areas: @schofield
will giving a talk on Riak and Ripple at the OK.rb.

Original Tweet here ---> http://twitter.com/schofield/status/17964732577

2) @acts\_as is putting together a mess of sample data and scripts that
can be used for testing MapReduce. It's geared towards using with Riak
but can be used with any database than can handle JSON/javascript.
This looks like it could be a great tool. Thanks, Scott!

3) @roidrage posted another great piece on NoSQL, this one entitled
"Relational Data, Document Databases and Schema Design." This one
doesn't focus on Riak specifically but is still worth the read. In my
opinion, Mathias is one of the most objective and thorough
commentators writing about NoSQL. Read it!

4) Q --- Is there a way to get the amount of keys stored in a bucket?
(from rb2k via #riak)

 A --- Check out question #4 here --->

5) allen and seancribbs had a brief exchange that started with "Why
Dynamo Design instead of BigTable?"

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/468104

6) seancribbs, benblack and jdbl had a long conversation in #riak that
started with "Anyone around to chat about some theoretical failure
scenarios / corner cases?"

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/468186

7) A --- Is lots of buckets (10k+) bad for Riak? (from demonnoid via #riak)

 Q --- As long as you're not modifying the default properties,
there's no cost.

8) copius, benblack and seancribbs had a great convo about schema
design, bucket limitations and backend choice in #riak.

Gist here ---> http://gist.github.com/468320

9) Q --- Will the Schema Design Webinar be recorded?

 A --- Yes!
