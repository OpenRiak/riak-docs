Marco,

Thanks for stopping to take a look at Riak. Here are a few thoughts for you to 
consider and try:

The "few additional properties we can ignore" actually can't be ignored. The 
reason is because the SpiderMonkey JS VMs that are running on each node still 
have to parse the JSON data for each document. If your document is 1K of JSON 
text, but you only care about a fraction of that data, the VM still has to 
parse it to give you - what essentially boils down to - a length value. This is 
going to end up being a time sync (you would need to profile to know how much). 
So, ...

Yes. 

> Also, will updating the session documents be a problem for Riak?


You may want to consider using "links" in your documents to help speed this up: 
http://wiki.basho.com/Links.html. The data you are talking about storing off is 
(from what little I know) largely immutable. The list of pages a user visited 
during their time on the site isn't going to change once the session is done. 
So, you should be able to make a really small object that is nothing more than 
a key of \_page\_count and the value being the count of the pages 
visited. You can then make a link from the original session object to the 
cached count object with a link. Once in place, you can then use a post-commit 
hook (http://wiki.basho.com/Commit-Hooks.html#Post-Commit-Hooks) so that 
whenever the session log is updated, the cached page count object is also 
updated, keeping the data in-sync. This will seriously cut down on the time 
spent in the JS VMs. 

Next, without knowing what else is in the database (is it 100% logging data or 
do your logs make up only 10% of the total data?), it's worth taking a moment 
to point out secondary indexes: http://wiki.basho.com/Secondary-Indexes.html. 
Right now, your map is traversing over all the objects in the database. Buckets 
are \*not\* physical namespaces (like directories in a file system). The bucket 
name is merely a quick "early out" for the map phase before your Javascript 
code is even executed. It's still fast, but maybe not fast enough. CouchDB 
views make a tradeoff to gain performance at the cost of disk space, and you 
can use secondary indices the same way. If you give all your page count objects 
a 2i index field, you can then pass it as an input to map/reduce query, you are 
now instantly limiting which objects are getting scanned to only those with the 
2i field. This has the added benefit of allowing you to range query (e.g. if 
your field was a UTC timestamp, you could look at only the page hits for 
sessions over the last week, month, day, minute, â€¦).

Hope this helps, if you have the time/ability to try the above and give 
feedback on the results, I'd be very interested in learning them and helping 
further.
