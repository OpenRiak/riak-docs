Thanks for your answer. I have installed VMware. I'll try to make Riak 
work from there.


Cheers,

Jérôme

Hello, Jérôme.

It looks like Jeremiah has already answered one of your questions, so
I'll get the other.

My other question/remark is: there does not seem to be a downloadable
version of Riak for Windows. Is there a technical reason for this or is it a
'religious' issue?

There's certainly no operating system religion at work here, simply
the limited resources of a small team. A few different people in the
community have been working on Windows support, which we think is a
great idea -- we just currently don't have anyone spare to make
official windows releases, QA and benchmark those releases on various
windows systems, and so on.
