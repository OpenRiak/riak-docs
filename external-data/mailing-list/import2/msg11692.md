All,
 This is kind of like the last thorn before moving with riak
implementation for me.
My use case for now is storing 
1) transient payload in memory backend with ttl 
2) storing something similar to user sessions in bitcask with ttl.

Since the backend stores are ttl, I need to be able to count the no of
active objects in the buckets every so often ( say every 10 min) 
js mapreduce is just not usuable and either times out or gives wrong count.
Is there some efficient way to count the total live objects in these buckets
backed by backend with ttl?

I'm using riak 1.4


Thanks
Kumar
