Daniel,

See this post (
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2017-August/019488.html)
and the links in it for some more details on issues with the core claim
algorithm. The fix is in the pending release 2.2.5 which Russell is adding
the finishing touches to at the moment.

However, the fix may not immediately resolve your problem - the fix is
about preventing this situation, not necessarily about resolving it once it
has been created. Also the issue we saw that would lead to this, would not
(I think) be triggered by adding a single node - unless the cluster already
had the problem. So it is possible, although you are seeing the warning
now, you had the issue when your originally created the cluster, and the
change is just persisting the issue. For instance going from nothing
straight to a 6-node with a ring-size of 128 would create this problem.

As a workaround there is the core claim v3 algorithm which can be turned
on, and you can see if this offers a better cluster plan without
violations. I can't right now remember how to trigger v3 claim algorithm
though - google letting me down.

Ultimately, this may not be such a crisis. The error is through whenever
the cluster cannot guarantee a "target\_n\_val" of 4. So if you have an
n\_val of 3 - you're not necessarily at risk of data loss. To know you
will have to look at your ring via riak attach (see bullet point 2 in
http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/using/running-a-
cluster/#add-a-second-node-to-your-cluster).

If you can figure out the violations from your ring, you may be able to
resolve by leaving the node that has the violations, and then re-adding it.

Sorry, I'm a bit rushed - but I hope this helps get you started.

Martin
