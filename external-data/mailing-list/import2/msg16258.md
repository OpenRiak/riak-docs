The riak-user list has been incredibly active! Here are some of the
conversations that have not yet been part of The Recap.

## Basho Docs Announcement
\* The documentation of Basho is going through a series of updates in
the coming months. Be sure to review "How To Contribute" section of
our README [0] before opening a PR

## ICYMI Code Announcements
\* The Riak Ruby client 2.2.0 dropped recently. See the announcement
details from Bryce [1]

## Recently answered
\* Sambit ran into a error after renaming a Riak node. Charles reminds
him of this thorough document on the matter [2]
\* Konstantin was reassurred of his rolling upgrade considerations [3]
and reviewed the requirements for leveldb [4]
\* Sinh has a really interesting question regarding SolrSpatial with
Riak Search [5]
\* Adam asked about a build for Ubuntu Trusty Tahr [6] and found what
he needed on Packagecloud [7]
\* Riak S2 (aka CS) had an incorrect URL pointed out by Toby [8] and
corrected by Chris' PR [9]
\* Robert's JVM had a memory mismatch between available memory and
allocated memory that Luke helped with [10]
\* Cosmin simulated an error and requested a more detailed error [11]
\* Shunichi pointed out a confusion that Toby ran into in his Riak S2
(aka CS) riak.conf file [12]. This complexity will reduce in 2.1
\* This thread, starting here [13], gets into the details of deleting
massive amounts of data from an existing Riak KV system

## Worth Re-reading
\* If you haven't reviewed it already, it is well worth revisiting the
Syslog-ng usage of Riak KV here [14]
\* If you're interested in the difference between Riak and Orleans, you
should review Christopher Meiklejohn's side-by-side comparison here
[15]

## Community Notes
\* Webmachine is now its own organization. If you're into the
Webmachine code base, get involved [16]
\* Have you brought Riak KV or S2 into production at a new place? Did
you find a blog or presentation helpful? Good! Share it in our release
