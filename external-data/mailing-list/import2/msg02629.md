Hi Ishwar,

Yes, a very typical configuration is to put a small load-balancer (e.g. 
haproxy) on each application server that balances request across all of the 
Riak servers. Then the client need not know about multiple servers and can 
connect to the load balancer on localhost.

It is not currently, but we are looking into the feasibility of supporting 
other languages. However, I might say that if you're already doing Python and 
PHP, it would be worth your while (and not difficult) to learn JavaScript.

I don't know of any, but we have a decent number of Pythonistas on the list. 
Hopefully one of them can help you out.
