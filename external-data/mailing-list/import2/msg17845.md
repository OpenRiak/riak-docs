Hi Michael,

For the Set, Map, and Counter data types the only other situation I can
think of is if the user explicitly set the "INCLUDE\_CONTEXT" option to
false. That option defaults to true, so it should always return one if the
data type you fetched isn't a bottom (initial) value. If it is the bottom
value, the context will be NULL.

Thanks,
Alex
