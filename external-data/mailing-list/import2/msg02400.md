Hey All,

I just learned that there is an open speaking slot for this
Wednesday's Hadoop / Scalability / NoSQL Meetup happening in Seattle.
Anyone in or around that area available to give a 30-60 minute
Riak-related presentation? I spoke with the organizer and he said
would love some Riak content if anyone is up for talking.

Details here ---> http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Hadoop-HBase-NoSQL-Meetup/

Any takers? (I know it's short notice but I thought I would give it a shot.)

Let me know.

Thanks,

Mark
