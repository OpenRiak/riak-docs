Hi,

I've been experimenting with Riak and I've run into unexpected behavior when 
using link-walk.
Basically link-walking stops working for a bucket that is set with replication 
factor of 1. The replication factor
was always set before using the bucket (filling it with data), both on a 
per-bucket basis and on a global basis 
(on app.config) and the result is the same. I'm running Riak 0.14.1 on Mac OS X 
and I'm using Ruby's client. 
It's not a client problem though since the same problem exists when I issue the 
link-walk directly through the 
http interface (using curl).
It's possible that this behavior is expected but I couldn't find anything on 
it, so spare me my ignorance ;-)

Regards,
André Silva
