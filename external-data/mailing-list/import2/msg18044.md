For original testing in isolation I used this:

https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/blob/master/test/volume/single\_node/src/basho\_bench\_driver\_eleveleddb.erl

But I've focused on testing since within Riak using the standard
basho\_bench/examples/riakc\_pb.config test

Testing of secondary indexing is one of the next big things for me,
definitely going to do this in March. From a development perspective doing
clones/snapshots was a lot easier than it presumably is in C++. I'm unsure
about how performance will compare, as 2i terms do end up clumped together
on disk in leveldb and I know MVM has done a lot of optimisation work in
that area.

Some things that may help leveled are: there's no overlapping files in
level 1; the levels don't increase in depth as rapidly. However, there are
some issues (https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/issues/34) that I may
still need to contend with.

I think there may be some interesting possibilities with Map functions
based on HEAD not GET requests. So perhaps as a developer I could add a
bitmap index to my object metadata, and roll across those bitmaps
efficiently through a Map function now that I wouldn't need to pull the
whole object off disk to achieve that. So the concept of division between
Metadata and Value may open up efficient query ideas beyond 2i
