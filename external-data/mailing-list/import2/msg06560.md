Hi Gal,

You are indeed right in thinking that this is not a show-stopper. It's
essentially a warning that GC took a long time. Take a look at hte erlang
docs for more info on the specifics of long\_gc [1].

As far as preventing them, you have two options: use less memory, or
increase the memory settings in your app.config to a point where Riak
doesn't complain any more.

Hope that helps.

Mark
