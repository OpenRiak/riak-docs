Kevin,

No I'm not saying that bucket's can't be deleted. I'm saying that you
should choose an alternative method. For example, manage your keys in
another way perhaps by querying a 2i and using the result to delete the
values. This could be done via an Erlang map reduce job. You could store
the keys elsewhere for later retrieval then delete each object via the key.

The problem here isn't deleting buckets, the problem is listing keys. I do
think that other Riak users, Basho people in particular, would be better
positioned to offer alternative approaches than me.
