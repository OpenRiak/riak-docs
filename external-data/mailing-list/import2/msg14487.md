Hi,
 I came across the storage system discussion thread. We have a
requirement to download thousands of files from S3 for processing. Ours is
not a cloud storage system but a cloud access system.

Are there qualities of Riak CS that can help us ? We want to download part
of a huge file and checkpoint if the connection breaks. File downloads
should be fault-tolerant when nodes go down.

Please bear with me if my question is basic. I don't work with distributed
cloud storage systems.

Thanks,
Mohan
