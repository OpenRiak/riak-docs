According to this your indexed data is doing an order of magnitude more
throughput than your non-indexed data. To me that would have nothing to do
with Yokozuna but perhaps some difference in typed vs untyped bucket code.
I'm not really sure. You put the exact same size/type of data in both
buckets?

The Yokozuna queries will probably get slower with each node you add but
indexing speed should not be affected. Yokozuna currently indexes all KV
ojbects locally. That is, there is no cross-node traffic for indexing. Did
you let the join finish before writing new data? Perhaps ownership handoff
was occurring?

How did you determine disk was the bottleneck? Remember tools like iostat
do not necessarily indicate a disk bottleneck as it can only see physical
I/O and not logical. You can have 100% busy disk without harming
application latency.

As mentioned my Andrew Riak, in it's default config, is meant for 5 nodes
or more. If you are going to use 2 nodes in production you should set n\_val
and target\_n to 2.

Another thing worth tweaking is you distribution buffer size.
