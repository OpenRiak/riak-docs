Hi Kresten,

A while ago I did some Clojure integration with Riak and I could even run m/r 
jobs in Clojure using code as data as you say.

I used the JInterface to have remote nodes as Erlang workers in a similar 
design of the Javascript workers. 

Sadly my code is totally outdated now but It Workedâ„¢ 

Please node that this was written a year ago or so when I was learning Clojure, 
so please don't set me on fire: https://github.com/videlalvaro/closerl 

Some related blog posts here: 
http://videlalvaro.github.com/2010/08/closer-clojure-erlang-bridge.html and 
here: 
http://videlalvaro.github.com/2010/08/riak-map-reduce-queries-in-clojure.html 
showing what I could do back then.

Regards,

Alvaro
