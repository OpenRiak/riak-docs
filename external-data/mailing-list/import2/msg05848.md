Hi riak-users,

I just tweeted this... but here is probably the best place to ask:

Do you regularly ad-hoc query your production data?

I'm actually interested in finding out how people perform these
queries. Use client libraries in a REPL, or scripts? Erlang by
attaching to a node? Post the full-blown JSON with curl?

I am using riak-js, often times with riak-ql, off the node.js REPL.
(It's quite ok, but comparing it to SQL, hell even MongoDB, it feels
just too much work to get data out.)

Francisco
