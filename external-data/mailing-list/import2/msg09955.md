Scenario 1: If you know the object doesn't exist or you want to
overwrite it (because allow\_multi is not enabled), you want to call
withoutFetch() - there's no reason to fetch something from Riak if
it's not there (not found) or you don't care what the value is
currently (and again, are not creating siblings)

Scenario 2: If you want to ... but since you're not fetching in the
first place the result should be exactly what is in your Mutation.
