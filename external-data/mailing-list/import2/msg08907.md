Hi Ryan,

Thanks for your reply. I have few more questions:

1) Is search enabling has any impact on read latency/throughput?
2) Is search enabling has any impact on RAM usage?
3) In production we have no search enabled. What is the best way to
 enable search without stop production? I thought about something like:
 1) Enable search node after node.
 2) Execute some night script that runs on all keys and overwrite them
back
 with proper mime type.
4) If we see that search overhead is something we can't handle, is there
simple
 way to disable it without stop production?
5) In what case we would need repair? It is said - on replica loss, but if
I understand
 correct we have 3 replicas on different nodes don't we? If it happens
how difficult and
 long would it be for large cluster (about 100 nodes)?

Thanks,
 Pavel
