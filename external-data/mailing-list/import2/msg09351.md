Riak is crashing on startup. This is on the same host on which I've reported 
other riak weirdness. I've included representative logs below. Several hundred 
similar log messages follow these ones, followed by messages about riak 
shutting down.

This process is configured with a file descriptor limit of 100,000. We're 
running riak 1.2.1. The host has 32 GB of physical memory. 512 vnodes. 

Any ideas?

Dave
