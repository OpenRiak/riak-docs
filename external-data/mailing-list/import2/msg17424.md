I have a Riak cluster (of 3 nodes, with 64 partitions and n\_val = 3) but I
find that for some objects, their hosting partitions / vnodes are not
spread out across the 3 nodes. In some cases, 2 of them are on 1 node and
the third is on a second node. That runs contrary to my understanding (link
here: http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/learn/concepts/clusters/) that
the data is spread out across partitions in such a way that the partitions
are on different servers. Is there something I'm missing here please in
terms of how Riak works? Thanks...
