Hi,
I wrote up a blog post about two fixes to riak\_core\_claim made by/with
NHS-Digital.

https://github.com/ramensen/riak\_core/blob/rdb/rs-claim-tail-violations/docs/claim-fixes.md

This work follows on from Martin Sumner's post to the list about the
discovery of these issues and some potential fixes
https://github.com/infinityworks/riak\_core/blob/mas-claimv2issues/docs/ring\_claim.md
back in May of this year.

TL:DR :-
Claim no longer generates rings with avoidable tail violations and
unbalanced vnode distributions.

We're still figuring out the best way to release these as part of a Riak build.

Cheers
