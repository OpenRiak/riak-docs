1. There should be no issue adding the same release version of node between 
operating systems. That said any performance differences between kernels and 
hardware could make the latencies a bit more unpredictable.

2. This has come up before so I'll link to the excellent response by Jon 
Meredith:

We're currently on 1.4 though so you may want to step through the 1.3 and then 
1.4 upgrades additionally. Post 1.2 we have capability negotiation so one can 
run mixed clusters.
