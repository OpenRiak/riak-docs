Along these lines, are there any ideas floating around about how to speed up
the listing of keys in a bucket? For the bitcask backend, it seems like an
index of keys-by-bucket ought to be the kind of thing that could be stored
in the hints files to speed this up without affecting performance for live
reads and writes.
