Hi Parth,

I’ve only had time to briefly read the overview and the goals. That said, this 
sounds great! I’m happy to assist in any way possible.

I’m a bit concerned with your use of the set embedded in the map. Large 
objects have traditionally been a big problem in Riak due to the use of 
distributed Erlang and head of line blocking. I’m curious if you could 
elaborate on what type of data you will be storing in the set: how big you 
expect each item to be, how big you expect the map to be, and the overall 
layout of data inside of the data structure. I’ve provided some references on 
why these things might be problematic below.

Thanks,
- Chris
