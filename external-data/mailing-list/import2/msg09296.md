yes, that was my conclusion thats why my question was 'it is possible to
fail write'.
in a simple scenario you can use R val to ensure that you have enough nodes
to read from and riak will fail if you have less and this could be nice
sometimes. my point was that you cannot fail write, riak will never
complain.

anyway thanks for response
