Hi Runar,

Our current prototype of Secondary Indices works like this:

- You tell the system how to index an object by "tagging" it with
field/value pairs. The tags are passed to Riak via object metadata,
currently sent via HTTP headers. I believe this answers your main question.

- Those who would rather have implicit indexing can set up a pre-commit hook
to extract field/value pairs and tag the object on the fly at write time.
This would also be the recommended way to handle corner cases like
field/value pairs that can't fit in an HTTP header.

- We're initially targeting a SQL-ish type language for querying, with
support for exact match and range queries.

We're still in the process of designing how to expose the functionality, so
other parts of the interface are in flux. As one of my favorite quotes goes:
"API design is like sex: make one mistake and support it for the rest of
your life." (@joshbloch)

Best,
Rusty
