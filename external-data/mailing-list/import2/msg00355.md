For future reference, the problem was the GNU Coreutils version. My
version was relatively old (6.5) and did not have -n as an option. I
updated GNU Coreutils to 8.5 via this source:
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/

I no longer get the invalid option error. But I now get the following
error when entering make devrel :

cp -Rn dev/riak dev/dev1
cp: cannot stat 'dev/riak' : No such file or directory
make: \*\*\* [dev1] Error 1
