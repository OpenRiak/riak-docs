Dear All,
We have placed a basic set of package builds online at 
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.2/2.2.5rc2/ 
These builds were very simply a clone, checkout, make locked-all and make 
package locked-all so should provide the same functionality as building Riak 
2.2.5rc2 from source.
Good luck and please share your feedback.

Best regards,

Nicholas

More update.

There were some minor changes that missed the rc1, so we added them

\* yokozuna/746: [remove 
-XX:+UseStringCache](https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/pull/746)
\* yokozuna/747: [Remove jvm directive from test 
too](https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/pull/747)
\* riak\_repl/782: [Change ETS queue table permissions to 
protected](https://github.com/basho/riak\_repl/pull/782)

And today tagged RC2 (riak-2.2.5rc2)

Same rules as before:

At this point I DID NOT tag all the dependencies so it is \_VERY IMPORTANT\_ that 
the rebar.config.lock file is used when you build a release to test (e.g. `make 
locked-all`)

If anyone (Tiot? ESL?) can/wants to build packages please post to this list 
about location for those who'd rather test against packages.

We've got perf test results upcoming, and then we'll tag final.

Thanks for your patience, almost there now.

Cheers

Russell
