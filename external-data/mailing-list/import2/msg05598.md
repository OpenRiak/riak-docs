That is just a convenience method. behind the scenes it creates an IRiakObject 
with the value you pass and a content-type of "text/plain". If you wish to 
store JSON, create an IRiakObject, set it's value and content-type and store 
that. Use the RiakObjectBuilder class to create your riak object. Or create 
some java bean type instance and store that (and have the client automatically 
convert it to a JSON payload for you, it uses Jackson for this.)

Same as above, create an IRiakObject, set its value to the byte[] of your image 
and set its content-type and store that.

Cheers

Russell
