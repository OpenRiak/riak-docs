Hi Raghu,

At this time there is no official guidance for adjusting these values.
If you see overload messages in the logs, and you still have
CPU/Memory/Disk IO to spare, you can experiment with increasing the
fsm\_limit and vnode\_overload\_threshold settings, but please test the
new configurations before rolling to production.
