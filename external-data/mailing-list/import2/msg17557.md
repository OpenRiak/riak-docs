I've got a use case in which I'd like to use a secondary index but can't
tolerate partial result sets caused by hinted handoffs. I'm not currently
running riak search and, as this is a fringe case, would prefer not add the
additional overhead and complexity if I can help it.

I'd like to detect a hinted handoff operation and throw a 503, if possible.

Does anyone know of a way I can programatically detect if a hinted handoff
is underway without having to shell out to riak-admin (yuck!) and parse the
results? I'm running riak 2.0.5 at the moment.

Thank you in advance.
