A built release from source uses relative paths in the scripts to locate
the various erlang start scripts it needs to run. If you are building from
a rel instead of using the packages, the best thing to do is to move the
entire 'rel/riak' directory somewhere as a unit. So you can move
'rel/riak' to something like /opt/riak then add /opt/riak/bin to your path.
 It is possible to move the rel/riak/bin, lib, data, etc directories
separately, then adjusting the settings found in the
rel/riak/etc/app.config.

Is there a particular reason you are building from source and installing
versus using the packages?

Good luck,
Jared
