It was a bug (you're original issue.) Thanks for the find, sorry for the 
inconvenience. The problem was an incorrect encoding of the reduce phase 
argument, meaning that Riak ignored it.

The patch is on this branch 
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/tree/bz1262\_pb\_fetchIndex

I'm hoping to get it merged in sooner rather than later, after which I'll cut 
another point release.

Thanks again

Russell
