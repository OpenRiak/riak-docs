Hi Robert,

I get about 200 inserts/s with the Ruby client on really low-end hardware
(athlon xp2000). This means that in just over 1h you can get 1M tweets up,
which is way less time than you'll have to wait for a response from the
list. Also you can insert in parallel on different nodes, so if you have 4
(really old) nodes you can do it in 15min.
