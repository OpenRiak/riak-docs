Hi Salman,

Please re-read the Riak CS instructions carefully. You \*must\* only
have one Stanchion service running in your entire cluster:

https://docs.basho.com/riak/cs/2.1.1/cookbooks/installing/#installing-stanchion-on-a-node

Based on your latest email, it sounds as though Stanchion is running
on every node.
