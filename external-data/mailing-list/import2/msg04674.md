I did riakc\_pb\_socket:list\_keys/2 which completes quickly, then fetched each
object individually by the key using riakc\_pb\_socket:get/3 which was slow.

The bucket uses the default settings (see below), allow\_mult=false, using a
single bitcask backend.

I came across this problem because one of the Riak nodes was reporting via
Nagios to be short of disk space. Investigating I found that
/var/lib/riak/bitcask was taking up about 24GB of disk. This much disk usage
was crazy big, since there's probably less than 100MB of data I'm storing in
Riak. Since my original email I've deleted all item in the misbehaving
bucket (it took several tries as the read slowness/CPU usage
also appeared on delete operations). The bitcask folder is now 44MB in size
(down from 24GB!). I've repopulated the data in the bucket now storing 157
items. Things seem to be back to normal for this bucket.

Perhaps I inadvertently pushed something large into the bucket, but each of
the items I put in there was only about 3K in size - this doesn't seem
likely to me.


Bucket Properties:
{"props":{"name":"suite\_diff","n\_val":3,"allow\_mult":false,"last\_write\_wins":false,"precommit":[],"postcommit":[],"chash\_keyfun":{"mod":"riak\_core\_util","fun":"chash\_std\_keyfun"},"linkfun":{"mod":"riak\_kv\_wm\_link\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\_linkfun"},"old\_vclock":86400,"young\_vclock":20,"big\_vclock":50,"small\_vclock":10,"r":"quorum","w":"quorum","dw":"quorum","rw":"quorum"}}
