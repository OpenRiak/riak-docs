My recommendation would be to use GUIDs. Since they are in hex, it's
more difficult to accidentally make the mistake of turning them into a
number due to the nature of Javascript's type system. They do not rely
on an external system, and it is fairly cheap to generate them. If you
want to them to be k-sorted-ish (no guarantees), prefix the timestamp.
Of course, due to the nature of clocks, this can end poorly.

Since you want to write your code to be idempotent, probably as Riak
is a AP, KV, Dynamo-store, you probably want to rely on client-side
key generation.

A heads up though! Buckets are not free if you use custom properties
on Riak 1.X. Buckets are cheap on Riak 2.0 thanks to the work that
Jordan West has done on the metadata system, but again, not free.
