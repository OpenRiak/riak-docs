Hi Shimon,

I spoke with a member of the Java client team and the timeout is set to 60
seconds. In the 2.0 version of the client this will be user-settable.

To make sure there's not a crash or other issue causing the long list keys,
feel free to run "riak-debug" on nodes in your cluster and provide the
generated archives. We can discuss that off-list.
