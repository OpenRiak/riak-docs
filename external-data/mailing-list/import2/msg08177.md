Hmm. I would say you should ping Matt Ranney and Voxer about this but
it looks like you've already dug into that. [1]

So, as much as I love to see more code written (especially from the
community), you might want to hold off. To date, the most heavily-used
node.js code with Riak has been riak-js (which used to live at
riakjs.org). Francisco Treacy was leading the charge on this but had
to put it down on due to some other opportunities. Sadly, it hasn't
seen too much love over the past few months. However, I have it from a
few very solid authorities that there will soon be consistent work
being done on Riak-js. There's a fork of it here (but there should be
a different location for the new work that's happening) :

https://github.com/mostlyserious/riak-js

So, I would say hold off on writing your own and ping me offline if
you're interested in lending a hand on riak-js. Or sit tight for a few
days until they make their plans known. :)
