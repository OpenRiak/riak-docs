Doug,

Using the node\_riak and async modules, you can just do async.forEachLimit
with an appropriate batch size. That effectively throttles the simultaneous
requests and prevents overloading the cluster, but allows much higher
throughput. This enables a sustainable load to be generated over an
arbitrary duration of time for benchmarking. You can also run multiple
batches in parallel, with each forEachLimit batched independently. This
makes an easy way to concurrently run different batches of different
operations (just reduce the batch size of each group accordingly).

It is probably always preferably to handle a large sequence of operations
this way, rather than relying on an in-memory connection pool to queue an
unlimited number of items. That would quickly become a problem, crashing
Node.js from unbounded memory growth. Better to have lazier iterators that
are throttled based on that actual performance at that time - if a batch
takes longer than normal, the next batch will wait longer than normal. This
is typically what you'd want.
