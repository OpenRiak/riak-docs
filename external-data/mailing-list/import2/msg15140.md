I found that adjusting these RiakCS settings improved write speeds a
little for us:

 {put\_concurrency, 4},
 {put\_buffer\_factor, 8},

 As well as making sure the Riak vm.args included a high +zdbbl setting.

But even so, Riak CS has been really quite slow compared to other
things I've tried. However it has tended to work reasonably reliably
and is easy to maintain, so I went with it and it's been successful
for us. I'd be happier if write speeds were better though.
