I love these recaps :-)

A humble request though: is it possible to add linebreaks (say at 80
chars) to the IRC logs before they go on gist? They are impossible to
read online and every time I have copy paste the text into my own
editor to read them! I can continue to do this, but surely others are
having the same trouble?

Thanks,

Joel
