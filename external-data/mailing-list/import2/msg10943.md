So, I announced lager 2.0.0rc1 during my Erlang factory talk
( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BNpOHFvg\_Q ), but forgot to announce
it to the relevant mailing lists. So I'm announcing RC2 here.

What is lager?

Lager (as in the beer) is a logging framework for Erlang. Its purpose is
to provide a more traditional way to perform logging in an erlang
application that plays nicely with traditional UNIX logging tools like
logrotate and syslog.

Changes since lager 1.2.2:

\* Metadata is passed to lager backends (breaks compatability with old
\* backends)
\* Switch from Mochiglobal to ETS for global 'config' storage
\* Add 'application' to default trace metadata, captured at compile time
\* Support for 'pretty printing' Cowboy (0.8+) and WebMachine errors
\* Record pretty printing with lager:pr/2
\* Colored console support (requires R16, thanks DeadZen)
\* Overload protection from error\_logger storms
\* Many performance improvements (often more than 2x as fast)
\* Many minor bug fixes

Changes since lager 2.0.0rc1

\* Support for logging unicode to files
\* New tracing engine, based on goldrush (thanks DeadZen)
\* Updated documentation for 2.0

Please give it a try, and let me know if you have any problems. Lager
2.0.0 final will ship with Riak 1.4.
