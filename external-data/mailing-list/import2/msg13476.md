Hi,

Is there any small doc that could explain its usage a little bit:

From the Java perspective it would be nice if it point out its counter 
part methods with Atomic Integer like:


 \* How to create it? Does incrementing a counter will just create it
 with zero as initial value and then increment it? What if you need
 to know its value and then increment it before it is created?
 (getAndIncrement)
 \* get()
 \* getAndIncrement()
 \* incrementAndGet()

Regards,

Guido.
