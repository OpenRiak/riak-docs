Hi Alberto,

>From what I understand, the state of the art in terms of migration of
objects from Amazon S3 to Riak CS is -- writing migration scripts.
Either as shell scripts (using s3cmd), or language-specific libraries like
boto (or even just the S3 SDKs).
And the scripts would consist of:
1) get a list of the buckets you want to migrate
2) List the keys in those buckets
3) Migrate each object from AWS to CS.

You're right that mounting buckets as filesystems is a (distant)
possibility, but we have not seen much successful use of those (though if
anybody's made that work, let us know).
