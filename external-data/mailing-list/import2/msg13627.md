My understanding of what Elias wanted was a counter that simply stored the 
minimum and maximum values it has ever reached, an optional reset would 
probably be nice as well. It would be quite helpful when dealing with 
statistics counters that can decrement.

Then again, I could be wrong.

Hi Elias,

This is a great time for you to ask, if you’re asking what I think you’re 
asking.

Do you mean some kind of bounded counter that cannot be incremented beyond (say 
1000), or decremented below a certain bound (i.e. non-negative counter?) If so, 
then the plan is yes, but I’m not sure it is simple. If you have a design for 
such a thing please share it. We’re working with a team from Universidade Nova 
de Lisboa as part of the SyncFree project on this, but I’d love to hear your 
ideas for an implementation. If you want to keep it private feel free to email 
me off list.

Cheers

Russell
