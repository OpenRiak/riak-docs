Hi,
In case you want to try all the juicy new Riak 1.0 features from Java, I pushed 
a release candidate of the RJC to sonatype[1]. It will find its way to Maven 
Central as and when they sync. Just update your pom to use 1.0rc1.

Not \_all\_ features are fully supported (head\_only/return\_head on PB fetch/store 
are not available yet) and some of the ORM code needs to catch-up to. But the 
bulk of stuff is there. I'll be pushing a 1.0 next week and a point release 
with the ORM stuff soon after.

Cheers

Russell
