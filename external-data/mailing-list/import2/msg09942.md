Ingo -

Unfortunately once you've got a sibling tombstone, things get a bit
tricky. It's not going away until you resolve them which when using
the JSONConverter in the Java client, you can't. Oddly enough, this is
the first time anyone has hit this.

I've got a couple ideas on how to address this properly but I need to
look at some things first.

In the meantime, what I'd suggest as a workaround is to copy and paste
the source for the JSONConverter into your own Converter that
you'll pass to the StoreObject and modify it to return null:

https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/basho/riak/client/convert/JSONConverter.java#L141

Have it check to see if riakObject.getValue() returns null and if it
does ... return null. You'll also need to modify your ConflictResolver
to check for null as it iterates through the list of your POJOs that
gets passed to it and act accordingly. If there's only a tombstone,
just return null ... which means you will also need to modify your
Mutation to handle a null being passed to it in the case of there
only being a tombstone.

In the end this may well be what I do but I think I have a slightly
more elegant solution that I want to look into.

I've got an errand I need to run this morning, but I'll get to work on
this as soon as I get back.

Thanks, and sorry for the trouble.
