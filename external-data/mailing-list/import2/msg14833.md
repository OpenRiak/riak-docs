Hi,

We have 5 riak nodes running riak-2.0.0pre20-1.el6.x86\_64 with a ringsize of 
64. We would like to do a ring resize because the distribution of content is 
very uneven (64/5 has a left over of 4 parts that all end up on the same node). 
The documentation says riak-2 can do this online 
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/ops/advanced/ring-resizing/) and warns 'Make 
sure that you have sufficient storage to complete the resize operation'.

Could anyone tell me how much is 'sufficient'?
And in addition, some of the nodes in the cluster have more free space 
available than other nodes (some are at 40% used disk, others at 60%). Is the 
location of the space important?

Thank you,


Max
