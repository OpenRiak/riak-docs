Fisher,

In the cases where you see file size discrepancies, are you able to retrieve 
those files intact from riak? Having a node in the cluster with an unstable 
network connection should not cause data loss because replicas should be saved 
to other nodes in your cluster, but it may cause some issues with being able to 
properly access those files via luwak. The chances of data being lost when a 
riak node goes down is dependent on what you mean by the node going down. In 
most cases, the replicas will take care of it, but in the case that multiple 
machines in your cluster fail, you should be familiar with the sync strategies 
for the backend you are using. For example, you can read about the bitcask sync 
strategies here: http://wiki.basho.com/Bitcask.html.
