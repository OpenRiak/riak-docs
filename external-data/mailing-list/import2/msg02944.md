Be careful here..

I do not thing Riak's "protocol buffers" are the same as Google's protocol
buffers.
Google's does bit-level packing and some other tricks that Riak does not do,
even though they both use the ".proto" file extension and very very similar
proto semantics.

That said, if they ARE the same, then you can take the .proto files and
generate C++ classes, and use the secondary library "protobuf-c" to generate
C structs for the wire format.
