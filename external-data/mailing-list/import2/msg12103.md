Hi there riak users

I've been running some tests on riak-cs on a 3 node riak cluster ( 3
servers , each host riak and riak-cs pointing at the local riak . One of
the instance is also hosting the stanchion )
Software versions :
 - Riak is 1.4.1
 - Riak-CS is 1.4.0
 - s3cmd is 1.5.0 alpha 3

n\_val was either set to be 2 or 3 ( tried both )for default bucket , yet
whenever I kill a single riak node ( simulate a server outage )
I come across the following error when try to use s3cmd get path:
\*
\*
\*s3cmd ls s3://riak.test/test/1\*
\*
\*
\*WARNING: Retrying failed request: /?prefix=test/1&delimiter=/ ()\*
\*WARNING: Waiting 3 sec...\*
\*WARNING: Retrying failed request: /?prefix=test/1&delimiter=/ ()\*
\*WARNING: Waiting 6 sec...\*
\*
\*
Looking into Riak-CS error logs , I find these errors
\*
\*
\*
2013-08-20 23:39:40.240 [error] <0.14674.0> gen\_fsm <0.14674.0> in state
waiting\_object\_list terminated with reason:
<<"{error,insufficient\_vnodes\_available}">>
2013-08-20 23:39:40.240 [error] <0.14674.0> CRASH REPORT Process
<0.14674.0> with 1 neighbours exited with reason:
<<"{error,insufficient\_vnodes\_available}">> in gen\_fsm:terminate/7 line 611

This of course implies of missing v\_nodes found on the single dead riak
node... :/

\*
Writing to riak using s3cmd keeps working flawlessly . And of course after
I revive the dead node
misplaced data is re-distributed ( ring of vnodes are redistributed to
reflect requested distribution ).

I might be missing something here , but ain't the whole point of
replication is to avoid such issues with a single node failure ? ( assuming
n\_val is greater the 1 )
Isn't a 3 Node Cluster with n\_val =>2 supposed to withstand a single node
failure ?
Have I missed something in configuring Riak-CS ?

Any help will be appreciated , this is really the final missing piece of
our RiAK puzzle :)
