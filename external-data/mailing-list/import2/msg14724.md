Hi David,

I can see from your BOSH specs that you're using Riak 1.4.7 and Riak
CS 1.4.4. I'd like to first recommend upgrading to Riak 1.4.10 and
Riak CS 1.5.0 as both versions have had important bug fixes. CS 1.5.0
specifically has had fixes related to GC.

I'll dig further into your repo but I thought I'd start by pointing
out the GC docs here:
http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/garbage-collection/
