Just to borrow some Cribbs-brand pedantry here:- That isn't true. We read the 
data from disk, increment an entry in what is essentially a version vector, and 
write it back, (then replicate the result to N-1 vnodes.) The size of the 
counter depends on the number of actors that have incremented it (typically N) 
not the number of operations.

There won't be siblings on disk (we do create a temporary one in memory, does 
that count?) \_unless\_

1. you also write an object to that same key in a normal riak kv way (don't do 
that)
2. AAE or MDC cause a sibling to be created (this is because we use the 
operation of incrementing a counter to identify a key as counter, to the rest 
of riak it is just a riak object)

In that last case, an increment operation to the key will resolve the 
sibling(s).
