Hi Emyr,

Using one and the same cluster for both Riak-KV and Riak-S2 is not
officially supported by Basho. Riak-S2 uses a specialised backend
configuration and very specific buckets, which a generic KV configuration
may interfere with. So, while technically possible, we recommend not to mix
a KV and an S2 use case within the same cluster.

If you have access to additional computing resources (e.g. cloud
instances), it would be easiest to spin up an entirely separate cluster for
your S2 trial. This avoids having to adjust KV and S2 configuration files
for non-standard ports. You can also spin up a new cluster on the existing
hardware, but please make sure that you change the cookie for the new
cluster to a unique value and that you adjust the ports in use so that they
don't overlap with the default ports.

Regards,

Magnus
