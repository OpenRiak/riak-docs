We worked through this on IRC, but to summarize:

It looks like the 403's were caused by a misformatted curl command. The
steps below make it work:

# Install the bucket hook.
bin/search-cmd install my\_bucket

# Index the document in the bucket. Assumes the XML document is in
document.xml

curl -X POST -H "content-type:application/xml"
http://localhost:8098/riak/my\_bucket/my\_object --data-binary @document.xml


# Run the query.

bin/search-cmd search my\_bucket "Event\_EntityRef:nur"


Regarding the perceived query wackiness, this was caused because the
document had been indexed with content-type text/plain, ignoring the XML
structure. As a result, the entire document was tokenized and stuffed into
the default field (the "value" field).


Further compounding the issue is the fact that the default analyzer
tokenizes by 1) splitting on any whitespace or punctuation, 2) lowercasing
all tokens, and 3) throwing out any tokens smaller than three characters.
This has been a repeated cause of confusion, and as a result the next
version of Search will use the Whitespace analyzer by default. (The
whitespace analyzer simply tokenizes based on spaces/tabs/newlines but
leaves everything else alone.)


Best,

Rusty
