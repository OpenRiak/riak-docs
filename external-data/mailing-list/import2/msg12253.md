I can't speak for Riak 2.0, but CorrugatedIron's support doesn't have any
tests supporting it... I hope to get on that next week to see where things
are. The only hold up is time on my end. I believe the riak branch should
be workable for development. There are features in CI that need clean up,
but I'll start pushing out RC builds through nuget for the adventurous.

CorrugatedIron operation would allow to atomically put individual items
into a set. I'm hoping to create change tracking data structures for use
with the get/put/delete functionality of Riak's server side CRDTs.

If you're implementing the CRDT on the client side, you'll need to figure
out the garbage collection yourself. If you're able to use Riak's data
structures, then you can safely rely on someone else handling the problems
for you.

If it weren't for my day job, I'd have this CRDT support in CI by now ;)
