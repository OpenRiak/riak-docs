As an effort to get some community feedback (and maybe even some
contributions) and to give people a heads up, I'd like to present my RFC
on adding security to Riak as part of the next major release:

https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/355

Feel free to provide any input, preferably via github, but here is OK too.

Andrew
