As you noted, we're sorta busy with the existing features for the next
major release. :) Insofar as counters go, we've had some discussion
about how to do them and may take a look at it after the release -- a
lot depends on customer needs.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by offline/batch processing? We're
working on improving the usefulness of MapReduce w/ very large jobs,
but I'm not sure if that aligns with what you're asking about.

Thanks,

D.
