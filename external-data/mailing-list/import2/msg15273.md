Hi,

I have a question on the schema, and the requirements are as follows:
1. Seach with pagination
2. I don't want some fields to be indexed (I would not use these fields for
searching), but they should be stored, since the fields should be returned
in results.

I looked up the default and did not find the field with indexed=false and
stored=true
