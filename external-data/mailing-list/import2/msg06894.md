Adam,

We are also using local\_client to run a riak\_core app together with riak\_kv in 
the same cluster.
Unless you have compelling reasons to do go this route, it might be better to 
split the two into separate clusters. You gain a lot of flexibility from an 
operational point of view, with the ability to spec and manage the two 
separately.
Not knowing details of your application, I cannot really comment any further, 
but I thought I'd bring this to your attention.
