Used to be we had to write "resolvers" due to write-heavy collisions on the
same kv, to handle the children.

Does Riak have any built-in resolvers (yet?) or is everyone still using
statebox or something else?

What's the current state of Riak in this regard, and is there anything in
progress along this route? IMHO, it is the single biggest 'barrier to
entry' to new deployments (including some initiatives in-house) because
it's really annoying to write resolvers. :)

TIA!
