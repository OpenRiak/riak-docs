Hello Riak Users,

Today I'm pleased to announce the 0.4.0 release of Yokozuna. This is a
small release in terms of features added, as there are no new features, but
an important release for reasons enumerated below.

\* Performance improvements to Solr's distributed search thus improving
performance of Yokozuna queries [1] [2] [3].

\* This release is based off Riak 1.3.0. This release is essentially Riak
1.3.0 with the Yokozuna bits added to it.

\* Yokozuna has moved from my personal GitHub account into the Basho
organization. The prototype status is still in effect but this is a very
important step towards the goal of merging Yokozuna into Riak proper.
