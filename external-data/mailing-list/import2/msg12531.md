Each sibling has it's own last-modified date, which you should be able to use 
to sort them when you get them back. 

However, I'd suggest the following: if they're siblings, they were created from 
concurrent edits. Thus, create a merge function that is entirely deterministic 
without using the timestamp. This should save you from any clock skew issues, 
and also from the fact that an edit may not have been performed with the most 
up-to-date information.

I guess people can't wait for our CRDTs to launch.
