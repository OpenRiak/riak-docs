Hi Christian,
thanks for the quick response!

I should point out that that page is not listed in the sidebar of the docs 
website which is why I didn't know this from reading the docs.

I presume Riak::Links are being retained - it's just the link-walking 
functionality which is being deprecated?

Thanks,

Paul
