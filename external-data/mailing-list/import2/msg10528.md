Hi,

I think for the sake of the archive I'd copy the following comments from
NH[1]:

 Mark, does CS fulfill the role Luwak formerly did? What's better
 and/or different about CS vs Luwak?

 In a sense, yes. Luwak was just basically plain-old Riak with some
 support for huge files. CS is a full solution for storing large
 assets, along with multitenancy, role management, reporting,
 monitoring and pretty much anything else you'd expect from a cloud
 store like S3.
