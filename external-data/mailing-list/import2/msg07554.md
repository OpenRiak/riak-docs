Hello Everybody!

I have read abundantly over the web that Riak is very well suited to store
and retrieve small binary objects such as images, docs, etc.

In our scenario we are planning to use Riak to store uploads to our portal
which is a Social Network. Uploads are mostly images with maximum size of 2
MB and typical size ranges between few KBs to few 100 KBs.

Does this usage pattern fit Riak? What are the caveats if any?

Thank you!
