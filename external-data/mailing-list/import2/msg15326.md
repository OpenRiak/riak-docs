Satish,

Here is a key line from /var/log/messages:

Dec 5 06:52:43 ip-10-196-72-106 kernel: [26881589.804401] beam.smp invoked 
oom-killer: gfp\_mask=0x201da, order=0, oom\_adj=0, oom\_score\_adj=0

The log entry does NOT match the timestamps of the crash.log and error.log 
below. But that is ok. The operating system killed off Riak. There would 
have be no notification in the Riak log's of the operating system's actions.

The fact that the out of memory monitor, oom-killer, killed Riak further 
supports the change to max\_open\_files. I recommend we now wait to see if the 
problem occurs again.


Matthew
