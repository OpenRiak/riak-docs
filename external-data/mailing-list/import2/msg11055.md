Hi Julien,

I was not able to access the logs based on the link you provided.

Could you please attach a copy of your app.config file so we can get a better 
understanding of the configuration of your cluster? Also, what is the 
specification of the machines in the cluster?

How much data do you have in the cluster and how are you querying it?

Best regards,

Christian
