Just FYI, I'm actually running 2.1.0 version of Riak KV and the default
schema is showing stored=false. \*2.1.0-0-g6e88b24\* to be specific on
ubuntu.

On OSX it's the same issue as well for 2.1.1
http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/riak/2.1/2.1.1/osx/10.8/riak-2.1.1-OSX-x86\_64.tar.gz

It seems that 2.1.3 has stored=true though.
