It's not a problem right away. But since the replicated data is not
actively synchronized in the background the keys that were not copied
until the node dies have one less replica. That is until they are read
at least once, at which point read repair does replicate the key again.
So it depends on your setup and requirements, if this is acceptable or
not.

Every vnode, which is responsible for one partition, checks after 60
seconds of inactivity if its is residing one the node where it should
be, according to the ring state. If not, the data is send to the correct
node. So the rebalancing of data is triggered by rebalancing the
partitions among the nodes in the ring.
The ring is balanced during the gossiping of the ring state, which is
done by every node with another random node at every 0-60 (also
randomly) seconds.
In the worst case it could take some minutes before the ring stabilizes,
but its statistically likely to converge faster.

So there's is nothing to trigger manually really. One problem I see has
to do again with restarting a node, which still has data that should be
handed off to another node. Initially only the vnodes that are owned by
a node started, which by definition don't include the ones to be handed
off. But if the vnodes are never started, they won't perform the
handoff.
It kind of works anyway, but the vnodes are started and transfered
sequentially. Normally four partitions are transferred in parallel, so I
don't know if this is by design or by accident. The details are
convoluted enough to suspect the latter.
In any case this would also make also have the effect that those
partitions won't show up in the output of riak-admin transfers, since
only running vnodes are considered.

I also forgot, that I patched another problem in my own version of riak,
which will prevent any further handoff of data after four of them failed
with an error or timeout. This probably happened in your case, if your A
nodes became unresponsive for 30 minutes (did the machine swap by the
way?).
I should probably create a bug report for this, with my patch attached.
Stupid laziness!

After reading your original post again, I think almost all of the things
you saw can be explained by the bug that I mentioned in my first answer
(the ring status of removed nodes is not synchronized with the remaining
nodes). The problem obviously becomes worse if you remove several nodes
at a time.


I should really file some bug reports for all the problems I found, but
it is just too much effort for me right now. I have fixed the problems
that bugged us the most myself, so I should at least provide the patches
like a good open source citizen :-)

Bye,

Nico
