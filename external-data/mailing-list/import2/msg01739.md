Hi Dan,

Thanks for the suggestion but it doesn't solve it. I found some errors from
riak log files.

=ERROR REPORT==== 7-Dec-2010::16:11:06 ===
\*\* Node 'broadc...@192.168.1.\*\*\*' not responding \*\*
\*\* Removing (timedout) connection \*\*

That's the only errors exist in the log files.

Please advise.

- Abe
