Riak Users,

We are pleased to announce the release of Riak 1.0.3. This is a bug fix 
release for the 1.0 product. Please see the release notes for full list of 
changes in Riak 1.0.3.

If you prefer your Riak in source form, the source code can be cloned from our 
GitHub repo and 1.0.3 can be fetched by checking out the riak-1.0.3 tag. 

Lastly, if you have scripts that need a direct link, our old downloads page is 
still available and 1.0.3 is available here:
