The erlang shell found with riak attach is a remote shell. You can make RPC
calls into the Riak node from there. If you look at nodetool found in your
install it can give you examples on how to use Erlang’s RPC call mechanism.
We don’t typically recommend people do that as a regular practice though.
We use it mostly for debugging and adjusting settings when problems arise.
We do have erlang clients though, and their links / documentation can be
found on our docs site:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/libraries/

If you have specific examples of what you have tried and what hasn’t
worked, we’ll be sure and help you get things straight.

Hope that helped,
-Jared
