I reproduced this at the command line. Here I'm storing two documents, with
IDs 'doc8' and 'doc9', into a search-enabled bucket named 'test-search'.

# This command works, even though 'lsh' is empty. I believe this is because
I've never put a field named 'lsh' in this bucket, 'test-search'.
curl -v -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"terms": "empty|en
string|en test|en", "lsh": "", "segments": "d do doc docs"}' '
http://riak.lumi:8098/riak/test-search/doc8?returnbody=true'

# However, if I use the empty string for a field that has ever been indexed
before, \*then\* I get a crash.
curl -v -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"terms": "",
"segments": "d do doc docs"}' '
http://riak.lumi:8098/riak/test-search/doc9?returnbody=true'


As requested, I typed that redbug command into the Erlang console, and at
the moment of the crash I get some output. The output baffles me, though.
The included ID is in the style of ID we use for actual documents, which
are stored in totally different buckets, and which I didn't refer to at all
in my testing.
