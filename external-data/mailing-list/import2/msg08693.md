I am stacking my application and Riak on the same machine.
It seems wasteful to use 127.0.0.1 or even AF\_UNIX sockets. Is there
anything that precludes me from running it directly within the same VM as
Riak, to cut down/eliminate the impedance mismatch/marshalling of going
through the external client protocols like HTTP/Protobuf?
Instead of building on riak\_core, I'd be building on Riak(\_kv?) itself.

Here be dragons?

Thanks!
