The writes to the bucket with the post commit hook would be super
infrequent...maybe once every 10 ~ 20 minutes. The global rate of writes
to other buckets though would be pretty high though. The infrequent nature
of the writes to that bucket is what lead me to think this would not be an
issue. But every other infrequent write would kick off a query that would
have data.
