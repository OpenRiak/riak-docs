We've looked at these recently and they're not exactly prime time.
They don't even compile on Mac OS X without a lot of prodding, at
least with our configuration. I think they also require some
development version of 0mq. That said, would be more than happy if
someone fixes these problems and builds something cool with it.

I don't think there's really any communication in the Riak model that
would benefit from better multicast. Maybe some ring stuff, but not
the reads or writes.
