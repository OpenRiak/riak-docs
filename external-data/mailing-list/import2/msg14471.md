Hi,

I'm sorry for resurrecting an old thread, but .. well, I'm basically asking
the same question as Alexander - will there be a way of link walking in
future Riaks?

We're currently looking into ways of moving some of our data from Oracle
into any nosql database. Vast majority of data will be structured into 4
tier ... structure - level 1 contains multiple level 2 elements, level 2
contains multiple level 3 elements. etc. The objects will not be big, so
we're fine with storing them as a single document keyed by level-1 object's
id - data would be used primarily for web lookup/display.

However, there's also a different group of documents that logically
references objects from the hierarchical data, at any level - it's
basically a grouping of a subset of above elements. Usually a group should
contain around 20-100 elements, 500 being very, very rare case.

Since an element can be in multiple groups at the same time denormalization
seemed to expensive. Link walking seemed a like a good idea - a single
query would return all the required data.
Alternatively, we were thinking about having a separate data store,
possibly in memory one, and then using a multi-get (python client seem to
be support it. http://basho.github.io/riak-python-client/bucket.html), but
we're not sure about performance penalty.

Any suggestions will be welcomed, we're not bound to any technology atm,
Riak is just a possible option.
