This isn't expected behavior and I haven't been able to duplicate the behavior 
in my 0.9.1 install with an ETS backend. What version of Riak are you running 
and were there any errors in your sas-error.log? I would try restarting your 
node and seeing if the same behavior persists. If it does please send us your 
app.config and vm.args files.
