k, that's what I was afraid of (full value read from disk).
This is for a client lib for Riak, so I'll reconfigure it to combine the
logic down to single map/reduce phases. Luckily the logic in this case is
mostly non-complex, while custom m/r functionality would be sent per phase
specified by the application. The custom m/r phases would likely be more
complex logic, so that pretty much works itself out.

Thanks for the feedback!
