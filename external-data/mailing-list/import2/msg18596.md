Johan,

Leveled does have TTL support for objects, but this is not added yet into
riak\_kv.

I've raised an issue to look at this -
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/issues/1684.

As mentioned in the issue, there is some thinking required first to make
sure that expiry works well with anti-entropy.

Things are a bit hectic for the next couple of weeks, but it is something I
want to tackle. Without the AAE problem it is easy to do, I'm not sure yet
how big a problem it is going to be to tackle the AAE problem - but I have
some ideas.

Regards

Martin
