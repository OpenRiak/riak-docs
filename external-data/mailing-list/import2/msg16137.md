We have a 6-node test riak cluster. One of the nodes seems to be using far
more disk:
staging-riak001.pp /dev/sda3 15G 6.3G 7.2G 47% /
staging-riak002.pp /dev/sda3 15G 6.4G 7.1G 48% /
staging-riak003.pp /dev/sda3 15G 6.1G 7.5G 45% /
staging-riak004.pp /dev/sda3 15G 14G 266M 99% /
staging-riak005.pp /dev/sda3 15G 5.8G 7.7G 44% /
staging-riak006.pp /dev/sda3 15G 6.3G 7.3G 47% /

Specifically, /var/lib/riak/bitcask is using up most of that space. It
seems to have files in there that are much older than any of the other
nodes. We've done maintenance of various sort on this cluster -- as the
name indicates, we use it as a staging ground before we go to production. I
don't recall a specific issue per se, but I wouldn't rule it out.

Is there a way to figure out if there's an underlying issue here, or
whether some of this disk space is not really current and can somehow be
purged?

What info would help answer those questions?
