I absolutely agree. That is why we've change the setting vm.swappiness to 1
so it swaps only when absolutely necessary. I think we underestimated how
much swap may be needed, but I also don't understand why so much hungry on
memory. 
Is there a particular activity, like 2i queries, AAE or levelDB compaction
that would require significant amount of memory?
What's the best way to go forward?

Thanks
Daniel
