Hi Joe,

1. I am curious why you would need it. Can you please elaborate on the use
case?
2. In addition to Matthew response, please see
http://docs.basho.com/riak/ts/1.4.0/using/global-object-expiration
3. Do you refer to something like post-commit hook in Riak KV:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/developing/usage/commit-hooks/ ?

Thanks,
Pavel
