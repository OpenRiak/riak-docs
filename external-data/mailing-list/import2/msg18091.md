Hi Everyone,

Version 1.6.3 of the Riak Spark Connector has been released, and is now
available through both GitHub
 and Spark
Packages .
I'd like to thank the team, especially Sergey Galkin
, for all their hard work on this release.

This release fixes some issues, and enhances some features:


 - Enhancement - Data locality support for Coverage Plan Based
 Partitioning #230
 
 - Enhancement - Improve Coverage Plan Based Partitioning: smart split
 calculation and more accurate coverage entry distribution across the
 partitions #231 
 - Critical Fix - Python serialization for empty JSON objects #226
 
 - Fix - Remove double filtering for DataFrames #228
 


As always, issues and PRs are welcome via the project's GitHub page
.

Thanks,
Alex Moore
