Hello, can anyone tell me is there any alternative to Luwak to store 
large files.??? I want some open source solution alternative to Luwak 
which splits the large files in small chunks and then stores the file in 
Riak database. I would also like to store metadata of the file in the 
Riak.. Please guide me thoroughly..
