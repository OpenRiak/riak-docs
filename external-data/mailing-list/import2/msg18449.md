 I also wanted to raise the profile on the work that Ted worked on providing 
substantially better visibility and control into the tasks which vnodes are 
asked to schedule, execute and return from:
https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/pull/895

This is the WIP tracking branch with the design, prototype code, etc.  This is 
an important effort to able to track "bad queries" from consuming an entire 
node's worth of resources.

 Thank you, Andrew, and Bet365 for hosting this event, and for shepherding Riak 
through these difficult times.
I will not be able to attend, but under enhancements, I would encourage the 
group to discuss the late enhancements to Riak/KV to support efficient bucket 
and key listing for sorted back ends.  This work can be found on the develop 
and develop-2.2 branches of riak\_kv; it was not formally shipped in any Basho 
production releases, but listing buckets has seen some testing (and the code 
changes are relatively small).
Listing buckets in time proportional to the number of buckets (not the number 
of keys in the cluster), and keys in a bucket proportional to the number of 
keys in the bucket (not the number of keys in the cluster) seems like a 
laudable goal for which I am sure customers would find use cases.  Key listing 
has always been an operation known to kill large clusters, and the advice has 
always been, "don't do that", despite its obvious utility.  With these changes, 
that advice can be dropped for a subset of users.

 Hi, We are beginning to plan out the two day workshop [1]. We are thinking the 
first day will start with an introduction from Martin Davies, in which Martin 
will detail current status and the asset list.  After which we will get into 
project questions, such as: Which license?The general consensus is Apache2. We 
need to complete the discussion as HyperLogLog has been introduced which is 
GPL’d. Our thoughts are to replace HLL. Baseline?We have heard some discussion 
around where to baseline the codebase. The concern is during the demise of 
Basho the correct level of diligence was not applied to promotes meaning the 
code such as HLL has crept in.  Governance?How are we to manage the project 
going forward? Our feeling is we do not need a formal body as being discussed 
in the slack group. We see the project going forward as a simple repo into 
which likeminded developers agree and contribute changes. Placing overbearing 
procedure and structure on what is currently a small community will dissuade 
other from joining and contributing. Supporting infrastructure.The Basho 
websites, github account, and mailing group are all included in the deal. We 
are currently supporting the mailing list, and once the deal is complete we 
will continue to support the Basho domains; restricting community disruption. 
RoadmapBelow, in no particular order, are the items we wish to address 
internally. If we can all share our lists we can come to an agreed community 
roadmap between us. ·         Review / rationalisation of Basho JIRA tickets / 
git issues ·         Replicationo    Address known issues (30+) to add 
stabilityo    Selective replicationo    Persistent realtime queueo    Review of 
general approach§  In / out of band§  Snapshot vs deltas ·         Generalo    
Address known issues (20+) to add stabilityo    Silent data loss bug in riak\_kv 
·         Enhancementso    G Setso    Big Setso    CRDT Mapso    Async read / 
write vnodeso    Split backend vnodeso    Head requests – don’t return body to 
co-ordinatoro    Rudimentary indexing (leverage TS work) ·         
Consolidation / feature cross population of KV,CS, and TS codebases ·         
Erlang / OTP upgrade  At this point we want to keep the structure of the day 
loose to allow the conversations to flow, our collective priorities to take 
precedence. The sessions will be live streamed, with details to follow. We will 
also man IRC / Slack for discourse. Food and refreshments will be provided 
throughout the two days. Hopefully this gives us something to discuss in the 
build up to the 12th Oct. We’re looking for everyone’s input so we can hit the 
ground running. As a quick update on the status of the purchase. We have 
exchanged funds and the court process continues. One clarifying point for 
anyone following the court proceedings. The purchasing company is our 
technology arm, Hillside Technology Limited, not the bet365 group. Thanks,Andy.
