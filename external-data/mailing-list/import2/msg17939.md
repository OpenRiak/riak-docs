Hi Raghuveer,

I have been able to reproduce the error message you are seeing after I
built riak-erlang-client with OTP-19. It appears that there are some
incompatibilities between newer OTP versions and the map-reduce code. I
haven't yet had the time to dig deeper, but suspect that changes in
Erlang's string handling may play a role.

Please try to re-compile the Erlang client with OTP-16, and let me know if
you can successfully run the example code you posted earlier under OTP-16
(e.g. start Erlang with "$(riak ertspath)/erl").

Kind Regards,

Magnus
