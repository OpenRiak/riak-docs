Not strictly a protocol change, but It is possible to run a MapReduce job 
\*without\* phases now. If your client previously disallowed this it should 
change.

To make it clear - the MapReduce JSON must still contain both 'inputs' and 
'query' elements, but 'query' may be an empty list '[]'. In 1.0.\* this would 
result in a 400 with the body

"An error occurred parsing the "query" field.
"No query phases were given\n""

In 1.1 you will get a list of Bucket/Key pairs returned.

Cheers

Russell
