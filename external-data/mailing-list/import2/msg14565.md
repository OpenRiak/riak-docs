Hi Bryce,
Single node?

Iâ€™m pretty surprised by this, in 1.4 every write to a counter resolves the 
siblings at the coordinating vnode. Do you know what your sibling limit is set 
too? How are you typically using counters in your application? Are you reusing 
the same bucket/key for non-counter objects?

Cheers

Russell
