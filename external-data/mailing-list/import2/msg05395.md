Hi Gordon,

I'm looking at the info you provided about the problem and I suspect that it is 
related to your use of 90 as the ring creation size. We generally recommend the 
value to be a power of 2, though we do not explicitly enforce that in the code. 
If this is a development cluster the simplest path may be to wipe out all of 
the cluster data and ring information, change the ring\_creation\_size to 128 
(for example) on each node, reform the cluster and reinsert the data. 

Another path to resolution is to use the riak-admin backup option to backup 
your data, change the ring\_creation\_size to 128, remove the existing ring data 
(i.e. the data/ring/ subdirectory where your riak data lives). Do this for each 
node in the cluster. Then restore the data on each node with riak-admin restore 
and rejoin the nodes to form a cluster again. Unfortuately, search data is not 
handled by the current backup and restore functionality so you will need to 
remove the search data from data/merge-index and then you will have to reindex 
your documents. Support for backup and restore of search data is coming, but it 
is just not there yet. Hope this helps.
