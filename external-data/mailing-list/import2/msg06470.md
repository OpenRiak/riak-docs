Hi all

I have installed the Riak induvidually in two EC 2 instances and it is working 
fine. But I cant use the join two instances using riak-admin

which specifies the Not reachable error.

Then I added the 
 
 {kernel, [
 {inet\_dist\_listen\_min, 8000},
 {inet\_dist\_listen\_max, 8088}
 
 ]}

I tried it after referring the forum mailing lists.

Then I tried to join the nodes but i popped up the same Not reachable node 
error. I am using erlang R1304 and riak 0.14 because the erlang R1404 was
not getting installed in the instance and showed the error like

Fatal error in wait\_\_(): Function not implemented (38)

Thanks 
Bala
