Besides just plainly writing a key, you could also do something like (pseudo 
code):

Riak.put(canaryKey, pw=n\_val){
 If ok -> cool!
 If borked -> sad face 
}

The important bit is the pw (primary write) equals your replication value. This 
means that all copies in the virtual node replica set need to go to virtual 
nodes allocated to their primary physical machines. This is a way you can check 
cluster status from the app level as in , is the cluster in some kind of borked 
state.
