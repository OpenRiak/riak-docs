I want to upgrade to 1.3 and I see the instructions for installing riak at
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/tutorials/installation/Installing-on-Debia
n-and-Ubuntu/ . But I don't want to install. I just want to upgrade. In
other words I have app.config and a cluster setup right now and I would
rather not wipe all that out. Can I essentially do 'sudo apt-get install
riak' to upgrade?
