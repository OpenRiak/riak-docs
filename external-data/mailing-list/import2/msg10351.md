hi,

i would like to ask if there is any timeline when this bug in "riak\_search"
gets fixed, see pull requests:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_search/pull/136
https://github.com/basho/riak\_search/pull/137

for me it's no problem to apply the patches during installation of riak,
still it would be nice to have it in a future riak release ... :).

thanks!

harald
