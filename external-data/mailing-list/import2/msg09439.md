Hey David,

So there are two likely causes here: either your ran out of disk
space and/or some sort of drive corruption.

When you have a moment:

1. grep LOG files to find 'error\ '. (You may have already figured
this out, but it looks like you have a drive issue)
2. save the LOG files before doing recovery ... sort
/var/lib/riak/leveldb/\*/LOG >LOG.save
3. Tar them up and send them our way so we can take a look at them.

We do have some documentation on how to repair level [1] (which will
soon be part of our official docs), but hold off on running this until
we can get a look at the logs.
