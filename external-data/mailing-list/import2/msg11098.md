Hi Kurt,

A Riak cluster can handle very large amounts of data, and 500 000 000 keys 
should not be a problem. Riak's MapReduce implementation is however not 
designed or meant to be used for this type of large bulk processing, so 
inserting all the data and then periodically performing MapReduce over the 
entire set will not work. You will therefore need to change your approach to 
how you process and query your data in order to make it work with Riak.

I would recommend looking closely at how you need to be able to query your data 
and then perhaps consider performing periodic aggregations in different ways to 
support these query patterns. This would allow you to directly access data 
through keys, secondary indexes or run MapReduce on a smaller set of keys, 
which would most likely scale and perform much better. Depending on your data 
and requirements, there may also be other ways to tackle the problem.

If you could provide me with some example data and a description of how you 
need to be able to query this data and what type of information you are looking 
to get out of it, I am sure we can try helping you design a suitable data model 
and an efficient approach to process it.

If you are not comfortable sharing this type of information on the mailing 
list, feel free to email me directly.

Best regards,

Christian
