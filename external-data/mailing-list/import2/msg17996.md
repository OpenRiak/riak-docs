While not super functional right now, I wanted to let people know of a project 
I created called Graphiak [1] that is a Dropwizard-based JVM service that 
receives Graphite metrics over TCP and stores them in Riak TS. Eventually, I'd 
like to support a graphite-api [2] compatible querying API so this could be 
hooked directly into Grafana. I don't plan on running in this in production, 
it was more of an excuse to try out Riak TS and thought it may be of interest 
to people.
