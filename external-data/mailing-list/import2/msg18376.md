Hi Steve,

Many thanks for your informative and comforting post. The program you're 
contemplating sounds sensible and, indeed, promising. 

Successful implementation and operation of Riak among enterprise users is in 
everyone's interest. Erlang Solutions has an excellent track record in support 
of Erlang. No doubt it would be a fine champion and conservator of open source 
Riak.

As an army-of-one-developer, with big dreams of an Erlang-based product, I do 
have one concern. 

I'm totally dependent on web-based documentation, tutorials, and the good 
graces of folks on the mailing lists. As much as I'd like to attend Erlang 
Solutions conferences and training sessions, they're priced far beyond my 
budget. 

So, I do hope that in your support of Riak you don't forget that there are 
indie developers with considerable interest in Erlang and Riak who, lacking 
corporate backing and travel allowances, simply can't afford your enterprise 
offerings.

Beyond that, you have my vote and support in anyway within my means.

All the best,

Lloyd
