Hector,

Apologies for the delayed response. I've been traveling internationally
over the last ten days and in my haste thought I had sent the reply, when I
actually had only written the response.

I do not have any carriage returns in my actual config file, I believe that
was added when pasting to pastebin. When I run "./dev1/bin/riak ping" I get
"pong". However, I'm running riak on ubuntu 12.10 on vagrant. And I have to
start riak with "sudo" otherwise while it does start up, it does not bind
to the configured ports.

Thanks.

-Ari
