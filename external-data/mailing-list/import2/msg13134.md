Stefan,

The Riak 2.0 technical preview hasn't been heavily tested with Riak CS
because it isn't a stable release. The best combination of Riak and
Riak CS to run right now is Riak 1.4.2 and Riak CS 1.4.3.

Below are a few settings you can tweak to reclaim disk space more
aggressively in Riak CS:

- `leeway\_seconds` – Number of seconds before an object is garbage
collected (might want to start with 3600)
- `gc\_interval` – Ensure that all nodes in your cluster \*but one\* are
set to `infinity` (disables GC on all nodes but one to reduce
redundant work)
- `delete\_concurrency` – Number of blocks to delete concurrently

You may want to add another node to your cluster before making any of
these changes so that disk utilization on the existing nodes in your
cluster goes down.
