 I was taking a look at wriaki and noticed a potential bug. In wobj.erl 
the remove\_links/3 function looks like it supposed to remove the links 
from the object that match the Bucket and Tag. It does the opposite 
though, it keeps only the links matching the Bucket and Tag (as per the 
logic in the link\_filter/2 function). Is this a bug or am I misreading 
this function's intent?
