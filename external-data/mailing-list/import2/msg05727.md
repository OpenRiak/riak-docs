Riak Recap for November 21 - 22
========================

1) Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene is working on a Ruby Web Framework called
"Shogun", and he's making Riak a first-class database. (Thanks,
Kurtis!)

\* Code here on GitHub ---> https://github.com/krainboltgreene/shogun

2) Version 0.1.20 of ldapjs-riak is out.

\* Code here ---> http://search.npmjs.org/#/ldapjs-riak

3) Gordon Tillman wrote a blog with some sample code that shows how
you can use 2i and MapReduce to query sensor data (based on a use case
that was discussed on the list). (Thanks, Gordon!)

\* Read here --->
http://www.gordontillman.info/computers/41-web-application-development/101-riak-secondary-indexes-sample

4) Eric Stevens submitted a sizable pull request against the PHP
client that adds all sorts of capabilities. This is an extensive chunk
of code and could use some review/comments from interested parties.
(Thanks, Eric!)

\* Code here ---> https://github.com/basho/riak-php-client/pull/17

5) John Leach pointed out (in #riak) that a Secondary Indexes blog
post from a few months back could use some augmenting. (The precise
suggestion was that we should include a link to the complete, current
API docs.) We happily added it.

\* This is the post (with the update) --->
http://basho.com/blog/technical/2011/09/14/Secondary-Indexes-in-Riak
\* More importantly, he wanted it known that his dog, Lily, played a
large role in spotting this shortcoming. This is Lily --->
