I using a ranged secondary index search to find then delete objects from riak 
using python (riak version 2.7.0)


something like:


 for page in bucket.paginate\_stream\_index("tile\_coord\_bin", min\_index, 
max\_index):
 for keys in page:
 for key in keys:
 .....
 bucket.delete(key)

I've notice in some cases this hangs after instantiating the page object and 
never proceeds to the "for keys in page" loop. This appears to be happening 
when the search has no results (page has no keys). Is there a method that I 
can call to check if the page is empty before proceeding?

Thanks
