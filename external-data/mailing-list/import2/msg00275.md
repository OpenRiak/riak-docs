Riak Rubyists,

I've just tagged and released new gems for the Ruby Riak client, ripple. It is 
compatible with the Riak 0.10 series -- HTTP interface only. 

The primary change in this release is support for ActiveSupport 2.3.5 in the 
lower-level library 'riak'. This allows you to use the basic client library in 
scenarios (especially legacy apps) where you can't depend on the prerelease 
Rails 3 gems. The 'ripple' namespace/gem still requires the Rails 3 beta 
version of ActiveModel.

In addition, there are some new features including an ActiveSupport cache store 
and a preliminary implementation of embedded documents via associations.

There's more information about the changes in the release notes:
