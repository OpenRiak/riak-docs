David,

I'm sure your version of Riak CS is 1.5.0. At 1.5.0 we fixed bug #475
by traversing whole bucket in creation and deletion [1]. This traverse
reads all objects in the bucket, even if it is already deleted.
Deleted objects remains physically for a while - (called leeway
seconds) - with it's manifests. Checking bucket before deletion or
creation reads manifests in a scheduled\_delete state. That's why it's
slow. If you wait for leeway seconds and make sure GC cleaned up all
of them, bucket creation or deletion will be as fast as before
creating many objects.

[2] is a little bit deeper description of how object chunking and
garbage collection work, for further reading.
