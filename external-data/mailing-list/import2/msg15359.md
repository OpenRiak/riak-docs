Thank you very much for the explanation, Jason. My example attack was probably 
a bit “off”, but the basic use case I’m thinking of is an API. Say I have an 
API that accepts JSON. The user has “spoofed” the JSON input to the API, 
possibly setting an “admin” flag or something (doesn’t matter what, 
specifically, just an example of how a property may be set). Assuming no other 
business logic validation (which of course I DEFINITELY plan to implement), I 
was simply curious if, when sending info directly to Riak as JSON, if the 
client did anything to sanitize input from injection.

Think SQL injection, but JSON instead. Data is data, representation 
implementation differs, but the same concerns apply. I’m just trying to see 
what I need to do to prevent that injection-style attack from happening.

Sounds like, based on your response (thanks again, by the way!), I need to 
validate the Ruby object after it’s created and ensure no invalid attributes or 
values exist, prior to its being sent to Riak.

Any additional thoughts on other security concerns I should have here? I’m new 
to “NoSQL” and I like Riak due to its operational model, so I’d like to use it 
more often. I just need to know what I’m doing before I put an app out into the 
wild!

Thanks again.
