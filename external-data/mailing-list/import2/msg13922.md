Hi Paul,

You would actually get the most predictable performance simply storing the
edges as k/v pairs and 'following' the links client-side. This is
especially helpful if you have a wide trees or a high crossing number, for
example. In such cases, you can retrieve multiple edges simultaneously in
parallel, which is a much more efficient query pattern than having Riak hop
around the cluster finding those edges and queuing up the result set while
the client application waits.

Another advantage of this approach is that you can keep your logic and
tests in your native language, rather than going through Riak's m/r
abstraction.

This is a different mindset from working with relational databases, where
we were taught to always do as much calculation in the database layer as
possible. With a database tuned for high concurrency and low latency like
Riak, you will get the most bang for your buck if you keep the application
close to the database, pre-calculate your desired results as much as
possible, and perform the calculations and logic in the client application
layer, not the database layer.

Thanks!
-Casey
