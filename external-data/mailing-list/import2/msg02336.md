4) The README for the PHP Client was redone yesterday by KevBurnsJr.
Check it out. It's nice.

Thanks, Kev.

5) @bradfordw sent me a truly exceptional graphic he made that I
thought merited further distribution.

(Things like this are encourage, btw...)

6) We added two new Erlang functions to Riak Function Contrib. They
both came from Ryan Maclear (@ryanmaclear). Test drive them if you've
got a few minutes.

Thanks, Ryan.

7) The Riak Knowledge Base (KB) hasn't been talked about too much (as
we are still populating it with knowledge) but it's about time to pass
it along to you. The KB is intended to be the home for one-off, less
detailed information than wiki.basho.com, so keep that in mind when
you're perusing.
