Riak Recap for Dec. 29 - Jan. 02

1) Q --- Are there any instructions anywhere on how to install the
contrib functions into a riak cluster? (from ericmoritz\0 via #riak )

 A --- http://contrib.basho.com/usage.html

2) I'm not sure if we have any Play Framework fans on the mailing
list, but it looks like someone has starting building a Riak module
for Play.

3) Sean Cribbs wrote up a post on his blog entitled "Happy Birthday,
Ripple." This one is short but well worth it, as it takes a look back
at the past year of Ripple development.

4) Riak was featured in a much-ballyhooed blog post from a few days
ago that compared several NoSQL DBs.
