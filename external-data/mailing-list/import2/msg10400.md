Thank you. I now have the control "working". The 'https' is crossed out in red 
I am assuming that that is because of the self-signing that is mentioned online.

I notice that Objects, Map/Reduce, Graphs, Logs, and Support are greyed out. Is 
there another path to this information or are they just a work-in-progress?

Hi Kevin, 

If you've followed the instructions linked from the Riak Control README on 
GitHub, you should be able to just specify the path to the files you've built, 
the extension doesn't matter as long as the files are armored ASCII.

{certfile, "/path/to/crt/file"}, 
{keyfile, "/path/to/key/file"}


Let me know if that doesn't work for you.

- Chris
