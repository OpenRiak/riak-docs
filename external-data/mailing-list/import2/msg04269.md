Barron,

The score is indeed in the KeyData parameter when running a mapred job with
a Search query as input. In Erlang the KeyData variable would hold a value
something like `{struct, [{score, [1.0]}, {p, [4,16]}, ...]}`. Taking a
look at the Java client it seems the functionality doesn't currently exist
but a PR is in the works [1]. If I feel ambitious after dinner perhaps I'll
see if I can get it working.
