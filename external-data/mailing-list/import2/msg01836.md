I'm interested to see how it turns out.

One question: Shouldn't you be able to determine equality from the vclocks?
Timestamps could run into issues if the clocks of different machines get out
of sync. They also don't allow for much granularity - there's always a
chance of collisions.

How would this be any different from doing the same thing with bitcask or
InnoDB? Is it just your use of mmap to save memory space as opposed to
bitcask reading keys into RAM?
