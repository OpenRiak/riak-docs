There have been some changes in Riak 1.0 with regard to how deletes work,
and the python client has not been updated appropriately yet. In the
meantime, you can add the option:
{delete\_mode, immediate} to the riak\_kv section of app.config of Riak. This
should allow all of the tests to pass. You can read more about the changes
in the release notes here
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.org under the Delete
Changes heading.

Hope this helps.
