Hi all,

I am running Riak 2.0.1 in a Docker container on each physical host in the
cluster.

I need to programatically create bucket types from an application running in
a separate Docker container.

This was easy before using Docker, as I would just execute the riak-admin
tool from my application.

With Docker there is now no direct shell access possible between the Riak
container and the application container, so I cannot run riak-admin.

Each container in Docker has a virtual ethernet interface with its own IP
address, so obviously I can still access the HTTP and Protobuf APIs remotely
from the application container.

Is there any API available, or on the roadmap, to create bucket types ?

If not how would you suggest I create bucket types in this situation ? 

Thanks,

Isaac
