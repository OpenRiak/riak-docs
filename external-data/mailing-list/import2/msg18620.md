Unfortunately, Riak 2.9.0 was released with an issue whereby a race
condition in heavy-PUT scenarios (e.g. handoffs), could cause a leak of
file descriptors.

The issue is described here - https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/issues/1699,
and the underlying issue here -
https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/issues/278.

There is a new patched version of the release available (2.9.0p1) at
https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0p1. This should be used in
preference to the original release of 2.9.0.

Updated packages are available (thanks to Nick Adams at TI Tokyo) -
https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.9/2.9.0p1/

Thanks also to the testing team at the NHS Spine project, Aaron Gibbon
(BJSS) and Ramen Sen, who discovered the problem.

Regards

Martin
