When you start basho\_bench, you must start Erlang in distributed mode,
which means you must set a node name, and a cookie.

So, it would look something like the following: "./basho\_bench -N
foo@127.0.0.1 -C basho\_bench examples/riakc\_pb\_distributed.config"

Ensure that in examples/riakc\_pb\_distributed.config, remote nodes is
set to a list of nodese that passwordless SSH can connect to.
