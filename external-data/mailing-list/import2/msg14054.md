Sebastian,

Those errors are normal following an outage of this sort. Hintfiles will be
regenerated during the next bitcask merge and any data file that is
incomplete or has invalid entries will be truncated. This does result in a
loss of replicas but as long as at least 1 replica of the data is not lost
the replicas can be repaired by manual repair or read-repair. The manual
repair procedure is outlined here:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.2.0/cookbooks/Repairing-KV-Indexes/ .

I recommend that you manually repair any partition that discarded data file
entries but other than that your cluster should be working fine.

Thanks,
Brian
