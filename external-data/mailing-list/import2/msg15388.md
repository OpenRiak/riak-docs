Hey Riak Users,
 
We've just pushed an update to the official Python client to
PyPi [1]. This package includes support for Python 3, specifically
3.3 and 3.4.  This version uses the native SSL security instead
of pyOpenSSL [2] which is still required for the Python 2 series.
The ability to use bucket types for Map/Reduce jobs and to delete
data types was also added.
 
Documentation on the API has been updated [3], too.
 
Please see our Release Notes [4] for a complete list of bugs we
addressed.  For all other known issues, please refer to the
issue tracker on Github [5].
 
Enjoy!
