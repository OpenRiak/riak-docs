Hi Scott,

Thanks for your reply.

I have small doubt.

Let's say I have added three keys k1,k2,k3
k1 => v1 (added on 2014/02/01)
k2 => v2 (added on 2014/02/01)
k3 => v3 (added on 2014/02/01)

After some days I have performed below operations

1. I have overwrite value of key k1 (k1 => v4)
2. Deleted key k3

It means key k1 and k3 becomes dead keys

Right ?
