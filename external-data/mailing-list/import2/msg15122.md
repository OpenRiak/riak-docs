So, from my understanding, one of your servers was being replaced, so
you did a leave from the cluster, and it failed to commit, and then
another node failed, resulting in 3/4ish or 3/5ish of the ring being
up?
Did you down the failed node, or remove it from the cluster? What's
the current status of your ring?

Can you run:
riak-admin status (on each node)
riak-admin diag
riak-admin member-status
riak-admin ring-status
riak-admin vnode-status
riak-admin transfers
riak-admin transfer-limit

Can you put this all in a github gist: gist.github.com?
Also, are you running AAE?

You might want to temporarily turn off AAE, and transfers as you debug
the cluster, just to figure out what's going on with the cluster at
the moment.
