The example from the wiki for setting up an endpoint doesn't work:

client = Riak::Client.new :solr => "/solr"
ArgumentError: Invalid configuration options given.
 from 
/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/riak-client-0.9.5/lib/riak/client.rb:98:in
`initialize'
 from (irb):14:in `new'
 from (irb):14

Looking at the code in the gem I see client.rb has no search
functionality at all, nor does map\_reduce.rb. search.rb looks like an
alternative version of client.rb with all the search functionality but
I don't see how it's used.

Additionally all my .search mapreduce inputs no longer work. Is there
any documentation on how it has changed in 0.9.5? I didn't see
anything in the readme for 0.9.5 talking about this either

Thanks
Sylvain
