I ran into this bug last week as well. I've filed an issue to track
its status. You can follow it here:

https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=972

The solution, for now, as other people have suggested, is to run the
'join' on the nodes you are adding to the cluster, and pass them the
names of nodes already in the cluster. So, in your example, use this
form instead:

 dev2/bin/riak-admin join dev1@127.0.0.1
 dev3/bin/riak-admin join dev1@127.0.0.1
