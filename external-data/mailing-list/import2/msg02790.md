Followup to this (somewhat old) thread...

I had resolved my problem by putting the vnode\_cache\_entries=0 thing in
app.config, doing what Grant said. But sometime later it began failing
again. I was getting misses of 25%-50% on records that should have been
found by map reduce but weren't. At that point I tried Rohman's suggestion
of using a random seed, and that worked around the problem successfully.
 But this isn't a very satisfying fix.

So the vnode\_cache\_entries=0 thing doesn't really fix it after all? Is
there something else to put in the config that would make this work
properly, without the random seed hack? BTW since the original thread I
have upgraded from 0.13 to 0.14, and the bug is still there.
