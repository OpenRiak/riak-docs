Hi List, Fred,

After a week of going cross-eyed looking at stats & trying to engineer a
test case to make this happen in the test env I think I've made a
breakthrough.

We have a low but steady level of riak traffic but our application level
actions that result in solr reads are actually fairly infrequent. And when
one of these actions occur it results in multiple parallel reads to our
solr indexes.

What I've observed is that our timeouts are most easily reproduced after a
period of inactivity. And once I see a timeout after 2 seconds I kick off
multiple other reads to random keys and observe that some return instantly
while others can take several seconds, but then all return at the same time.

It's almost as if some shards in the java VM have gone to sleep due to
inactivity and we see a cluster of timeouts when we try to read from it.

I'm setting up a "pinger" script in our prod env to keep these awake and
see if our observed timeout rate reduces.

If this is actually our problem are there any JVM config options we can use
to keep the index active all the time?

//Sean.
