It looks like the query analyzer will attempt to load the JVM on startup 
regardless of whether or not it is needed. I believe Riak Search will fail to 
start if it cannot start the JVM. A failed start in that scenario seems like 
the least surprising behavior considering without a JVM none of the default 
behavior would work. Perhaps an option to explicitly turn off loading the JVM 
would make a good feature request?

Thanks
Dan
