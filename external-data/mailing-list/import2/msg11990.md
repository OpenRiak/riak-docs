Hi riak peoples,
I'm in the process of adding a new node to a aging (1 node) cluster. I
would like to know what would be the prefered incrementing upgrade to get
all my nodes on the latest riak version. The best scenario would also have
the least downtime. The old node is at riak version 1.2.1.

My actual plan is:

- install riak 1.4.1 on the new node
- add the new 1.4.1 node to the old 1.2.1 cluster.
- bring the 1.2.1 node offline
- upgrade the 1.2.1 node to 1.4.1
- put the upgraded node back online

will this work?
thanks!
