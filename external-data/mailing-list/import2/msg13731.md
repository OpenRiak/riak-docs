Timo,

When you say Riak is reading data continuously, are you referring to the
AAE trees being rebuilt? I just want to confirm that you did remove the
anti\_entropy directory, as not removing it can cause additional repair
operations to occur.

AAE can be enabled / disabled via riak attach with

riak\_kv\_entropy\_manager:enable().


and

riak\_kv\_entropy\_manager:disable().
