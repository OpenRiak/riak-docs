If you are using bit cask, it takes a while before the space will be freed. I 
think the default is 24 hours. Below is a quote from the bit cask page on the 
wiki. 


Purging stale entries after a fixed period


To automatically purge stale values, set the expiry\_secs value to the desired 
cutoff time. Keys that are not modified for a period equal to or greater than 
expiry\_secs will become inaccessible.
