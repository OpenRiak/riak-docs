Riak sets (and data types by extension) are good but not great. The are gonna 
get better over time but still be saddled with the difficulties of 
distribution. Redis is able to do what it does because a. It's not distributed 
and b. It's single threaded. I recommend that if you need the atomic guarantees 
of redis data types you go ahead and use them. And then periodically flush your 
redis data to riak for high availability and fault tolerant backup. It's not 
elegant, it has edge case scenarios but it gets you a best of both worlds 
solution. 

Best,
Alexander
