My current plan is to use something very similar to your second idea (bulk
messages in 1 object). Here's my current idea, I would love to hear your
opinion on this! Sometimes a message will be sent to over 1M recipients, so
I think I'll store the message contents in its own model. My player
objects are stored in a relational db, so I can use their id's in my
player\_message and deleted\_player\_message keys for easy lookup.

Message (actually have 3 different message types, but they're all fairly
similar to this)
---------
{
 :subject => 'fdsa'
 :body => 'fdsa'
 :sent\_at => Time
}

PlayerMessage (key will include the player id so I can look this model up
by player
--------------
array of:
{
 :id => message\_id,
 :type => message type
 :read => boolean
}


DeletedPlayerMessage (key will include the player id so I can look this
model up by player)
--------------
array of:
{
 :id => message\_id
 :type => message\_type
}

I'm definitely optimizing for the recipient, I want to be able to load all
or just unread messages as fast as possible. I will not need to look up a
message and see a list of all recipients.


My idea is that when I load the "inbox", I'll load the PlayerMessage object
for the given player, then separate the read from the unread emails inside
the application. From my quick testing, this works great with relatively
small numbers of messages. I'm capping the stored messages at ~1000, and
the process is nearly instantaneous. When a user deletes a message, I copy
the message hash from the PlayerMessage model to the DeletedMesssage model
for storage. There's a business requirement to store all old emails.

What do you think?
