Thanks Chris for your email. MR is the way I do my link walking actually.
However, I was assuming that the links entry in the meta part of an object
was going to disappear. Please correct me on that if I am wrong. Otherwise
I should be just fine then.
On the other hand I did consider using the new data types, but then found
out that they were not compatible with functionalities such as 2i, etc. Any
pointers on that?
