Helo,

I would like to use a pre-commit hook written in javascript in riak to
validate the json schema of the data submitted

There are a number of implementations in javascript on json-schema.org

http://json-schema.org/implementations.html

is there a way to load an external library or libraries into riak so i can
use them inside the pre- and post-commit hooks

and preferably also the external schema definition files (or at least load
them from a bucket)

I use clients in multiple languages to submit data to riak, and it would be
ideal if riak could do the validtion of all data submitted.

Many thanks in advance.
