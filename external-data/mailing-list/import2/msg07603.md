Hi Istvan, 

Awesome work, I'm sure this will make a lot of people happy.

A friendly suggestion regarding your request for contributions: I think if you 
mirrored or moved the codebase to github from google code this project will 
receive higher visibility, thus increasing the likelihood of both adoption and 
contributions from the community.
