Hi Oleksiy,

How are you performing your 2i-based key listing? Querying with pagination
as shown in the documentation[0] should work.

As an example here is the HTTP invocation:

curl "
https://localhost:8098/types/default/buckets/test/index/\$bucket/\_?max\_results=10&continuation=g20AAAACNTM=
"

Once the end of the key list is reached, the server returns an empty keys
list and no further continuation value.

Please let me know if this works for you.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
