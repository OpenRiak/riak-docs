Hello

Why does the search-cmd return a "Could not read" error?


\* search-cmd show-schema mybucket > /root/schema.txt


\* search-cmd set-schema mybucket /root/schema.txt

:: Updating schema for 'mybucket'...
:: ERROR: Could not read '/root/schema.txt'.
RPC to 'r...@abc.def.ntg.ghi.com' failed: {'EXIT',-1}
