Howdy Folks,

Is there a way to configure Riak search so that only objects with certain 
content-types (e.g., application/json) are to be indexed?

I have installed a schema on a test bucket that contains field definitions for 
the (JSON) fields that I wish to have indexed. At then end I include a 
dynamic\_field definition that instructs search to skip everything else, like 
this:

 %% anything left over is not indexed
 {dynamic\_field, [
 {name, "\*"},
 {skip, true}
 ]}
 
After populating my bucket with some test data and then dumping the contents of 
the corresponding index bucket (\_rsid\_test), I see that there are entries for 
every key that is in the test bucket, even for keys that correspond to objects 
that do not have a content-type of application/json and who do not contain any 
data that corresponds to one of the field definitions.

I would really like to avoid having any indexing information stored for objects 
that are not application/json. Is that possible?

Many thanks!
