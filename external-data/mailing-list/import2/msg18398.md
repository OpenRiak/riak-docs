Riak CS works, but has some long-standing issues that have never been
resolved.
It doesn't support AWSv4 auth signatures, so some client libraries won't
talk to it at all.
It's quite fragile in respect to its connections to Riak KV -- if KV is
slow to start up, then Riak CS dies. If KV is restarted, then CS just error
messages to client for as many requests as you have internal worker
connections. (ie. many across your cluster)

Performance isn't particularly good, and disk usage ends up far higher than
you'd expect.

I've been actively trying to migrate over to Minio for S3 storage, instead.
Worth a look, and unlike riak CS, has had lots of active development in
recent times.
