I'd very much like to see the same thing.

I have a working branch and test here https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/688 
and https://github.com/basho/riak\_test/tree/feature/rdb-sib-ex

This isn't using the DVVSets but a sort of rough hack, where we store the event 
dot for each write in the metadata dictionary for that value. As you can see 
from the test it works. There is some work to be done to productionise it, I 
really hope I get time for that. Feel free to pitch in (the riak\_object tests 
that are broken would be the first place to help.)

My only concern is with client id vclocks (which are still supported in Riak.)

Cheers

Russell
