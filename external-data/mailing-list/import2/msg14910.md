Could someone please point me toward some authoritative documentation on 
whether a Riak cluster running version 1.2 can be upgraded in rolling fashion 
to 2.0 directly, without going through an intermediate release? We generally 
held back on 1.4 due to some of the growing pains we perceived around that 
release, but are interested in moving to 2.0 in a timely fashion.

Thanks,

Berend
