Hi Chad,

yes, you're right: the use of secondary indexes requires LevelDB as
backend. How much of an performance penalty this imposes to you I really
don't know. I'd still consider the use of secondary indexes because it is
an architecturally clean solution and hence simple to implement and
maintain. If you experience performance issues you still have the option to
scale out, i.e, use more nodes.

There may yet be another option to speed up write operations, depending on
your demands. You could use the memory backend for about a third of your
nodes and set the write quorum to 1. This turns the memory-only nodes into
something like a cache without any further need to administer this cache.
On the other hand I have to say I'm not sure you can enforce that at least
one replica of each data item goes to a node with LevelDB backend.

Best,

Stephan
