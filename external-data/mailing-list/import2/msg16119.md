Hi Cezary,

I've created some sample code that creates a CRDT from within a postcommit
hook: https://github.com/drewkerrigan/riak\_snippets/tree/master/hooks/crdts

It should be noted however that this is not ideal usage of Riak; There's a
reason that examples of this type of behavior are not easy to find. If /
when postcommit hooks fail, you will get almost no notice that such a
failure occurred because the PUT to the bucket which has the commit hook
will return a success to the client whether or not the commit hook succeeds.
