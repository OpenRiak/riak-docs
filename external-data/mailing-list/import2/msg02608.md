When posting data to a bucket without specifying a key [
http://server:8098/riak/bucket ] a random-generated key like [
GRwdM5bCPqSdsDa06j5cFNl3i2D, ChVD156ynnfXoZK7Pw9OMGoxUYX, etc... ] is
generated... however, shouldn't it be better that Riak generates UUIDs
instead of a medium-length random string? using this keys i'm afraid of
collisions if a bucket has many items... how collision-free is that
algorithm? UUID was specifically created for that purpose, so i think it
could be good Riak adopts this system in future versions. any plans for
that?
