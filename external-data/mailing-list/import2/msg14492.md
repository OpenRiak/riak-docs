Hi Leonid,

Lets try to increase the handoff\_timeout and see if it can solve your
problem.

Could you please paste the below code in a $ riak attach

riak\_core\_util:rpc\_every\_member\_ann(application,set\_env,[riak\_core,
handoff\_timeout, 5400000],infinity).
riak\_core\_util:rpc\_every\_member\_ann(application,set\_env,[riak\_core,
handoff\_receive\_timeout, 5400000],infinity).

You should be able to exit back at the shell prompt by pressing ^D

Could you please archive/compress and send me directly by email:

+ the ring directory (including its content) from one of your riak nodes
+ recent log files (console.log, error.log, crash.log if any), same node


Thanks,
Ciprian
