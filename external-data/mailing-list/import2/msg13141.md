Riak Users,

I'm happy to announce the Yokozuna 0.12.0 release today.

This release integrates the new bucket type feature and adds the
ability to migrate from Riak Search using AAE. Less disk space will be
used per index and a slight bump in query performance may be
noticed. Also, documentation was added on using Riak's new security
features with Yokozuna. Finally, three breaking changes were
made. There is some API rebranding, a change of the default field
separator, and bucket type creation. More details can be found in the
release notes.

Given the number of breaking changes since the Riak 2.0.0pre5 release
I recommended using the 0.12.0 source package until a new Riak
pre-release is made. This way the documentation can be followed without
trouble. See the install instructions for more detail.
