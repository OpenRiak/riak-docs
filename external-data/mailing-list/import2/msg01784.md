hey everyone,

i'm trying to figure out if it's possible to enable the precommit hook for a
riak bucket using the erlang library. i know you can do it from a curl
statement, or using the "search-cmd install". it also states on the
pb-client that there's only suport for modifying 2 bucket properties, which
is n\_val, and allow\_multi.

i was just wondering if you guys know of, or have found any work arounds to
turn on riak search for a KV bucket. (i'm trying to create a bucket and then
turn on the indexing from my application)

Please let me know. Thanks in advance.
