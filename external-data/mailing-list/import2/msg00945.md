Thanks Justin. It should be relatively straightforward to work around this 
current limitation in our ops plan.

As a sidenote, given that Dynamo forms the basis for much of Riak's design, I 
think that it would be beneficial to publish a document outlining the design 
differences between these systems.

Best,
Michael
