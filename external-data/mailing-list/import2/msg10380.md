Daniel -

Nothing detects whether there is a vclock or not. If there isn't one
provided (the value is `null` in Java), then one isn't sent to Riak -
it is not a requirement for a store operation for it to be present. If
an object exists when such a store is performed and allow\_multi=true
for the bucket, then a sibling is created.

The .withoutFetch() method was added to the StoreObject as a requested
feature. It is meant for when you are storing an object that was
previously fetched from Riak and want to avoid doing another fetch. If
that previous fetch returned nothing (the key was not found) then the
vector clock will be null.

When talking about deleted keys ... unless you change the default
`delete\_mode` in Riak's app.config, you're not usually going to get a
tombstone - they are reaped after 3s. Unless either you do a fetch
immediately following a delete, you're doing store operations without
vclocks with allow\_multi=true for the bucket (which is basically
"doing it wrong") immediately after a delete and a sibling gets
created, or hit a very small window with multiple writers under heavy
load where the read/write cycle interleaves with a delete and a
tombstone sibling gets created.

With that being said, yes, unless you set 'returnDeletedVClock(true)`
they are silently discarded by the Java client and not passed to the
Converter. If that has been set, the default JSONConverter will return
a new instance of whatever POJO is being used (if possible - if
there's not a default constructor it will throw an exception) and then
set a @RiakTombstone annotated boolean field to `true` if one exists.
It detects this by calling the .isDeleted() method of the returned
IRiakObject.
