Alain,

Hi, I’m the author of riakpbc. I did some experimenting this morning and 
discovered some rare cases that caused the connection timeout guard to be 
created twice, which caused some interesting problems (i.e. the command could 
succeed and the callback would be fired a second time with a timeout error). 
I’ve just resolved that and published riakpbc 0.1.2. Let me know if that 
resolves your issue. Thanks
