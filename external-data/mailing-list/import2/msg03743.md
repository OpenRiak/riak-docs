Why not decouple the twitter stream processing from the indexing? More than
likely you have a single process consuming the spritzer stream, so you can
put the fetched results in a queue (hornetq, beanstalk, or even a simple
Redis queue) and then have workers pull from the queue and insert into Riak.
You could run one worker per node and thus insert in parallel into all
nodes. If you need free CPU (e.g. for searches), just throttle the workers
to some sane level. If you see the queue getting bigger, add another Riak
node (and thus another local worker).
