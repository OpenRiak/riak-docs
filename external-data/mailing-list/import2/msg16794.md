1. does Riak have restrictions on bucket numbers?

In practical life no, as long as you use bucket-types properly.


2. same for SOLR indexes?


I assume you'll want one index per bucket. SOLR indexes are mostly 
limited by the RAM and disk space that you can throw at them


Interesting not theoretical, but practical limits when it start works 
 bad.


Use case: we want split users bucket to bucket-per-team model,
this bucket have also solr index on top. Can it work for 1000 teams? 
10k? 100k?


You should create a unique bucket-type, and have all these team buckets 
under that same bucket-type. That would work fine for 10k or 100k. For 
100k, especially if you have 100k SOLR indexes, I recommend that you 
have a solid cluster, something like dozens of boxes with a lot of RAM 
(100G looks good) and CPUs (8 or 12)


Of course these numbers are completely guestimate, because I have no 
idea what your workload will be.


Cheers,
