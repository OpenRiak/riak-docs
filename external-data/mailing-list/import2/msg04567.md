Morning All,

I have noticed that with the default vclock settings the size of the 
X-Riak-Vclock header gets really big really fast for certain objects that are 
updated frequently. I am considering setting small\_vclock to 4 and big\_vclock 
to 16 instead of the default values of 10 and 50, respectivly.

I know that that are various performance optimizations that are based upon 
certain default bucket settings and was wondering if this change would 
adversely affect any of those.

Many thanks!
