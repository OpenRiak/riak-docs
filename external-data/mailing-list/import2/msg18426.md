Hi,

No plans. Simply opening the conversation on how the community would like to 
receive (and take forward) the codebases.

Subject: Re: Riak and the demise of Basho

Given that all of the code except for MDC (and maybe JMX) is under Apache 2, I 
would assume that those components would follow the already existing license of 
the other components.

Is there a plan to change the original license on the open source product from 
Apache 2?

Thanks,
Christopher
