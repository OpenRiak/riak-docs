Hi Ciprian

Thanks for that info, helps a lot. That was my suspicion about 2i and
primary partitions.
I reproduced it with 4 riak nodes, stopping 2 of them and executing 2i
query.

Since placement of partitions is "random", does it mean I can have max one
node offline to be able to run 2i successfully?
In my original case nodes 4 and 5 were down.

Daniel
