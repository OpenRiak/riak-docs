Hi Paul and Magnus,
I have resolve it by using command :


 - riak stop


 - changing nodename into file riak.conf from nodename = riak@127.0.0.1
 to riak@192.168.1.10


 - riak-admin reip riak@127.0.0.1 riak@192.168.1.10

But I have another problem, riak starts with this IP but shut down after
about 15 seconds.


Can you tell me how can I resolve this?

Regards,
Jurgen
