I've been looking at object stores and Riak seems very promising. However,
I strongly believe that, to fit the model, object stores need to use
commodity disks and do failure protection by replication.
RAIDing/striping over multiple disks doesn't seem to be a valid option to
me. You're already paying a 3x penalty for replication and then are being
expected to pay a 2x penalty for RAID10. I've seen some discussions about
multiple disk per server being configured as multiple file systems, but I'm
not certain that is supported/encouraged. Is there some documentation that
I'm missing that could definitively say whether multiple file systems per
server is supported/encouraged?

Thanks,

Jim
