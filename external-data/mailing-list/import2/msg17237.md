All,

Using the Riak .NET client, what is the best way to execute CRDT commands as 
part of a batch? For example, I would like to wrap the FetchMap command 
together with other commands and send them to Riak as a group so as to reduce 
the number of round trips to the server. My API has no expectations regarding 
execution order or transactional behavior. It appears this was possible at one 
point using the DtFetchMap method on the IRiakBatchClient interface, but it is 
now marked as deprecated along with all the other "Dt" methods on this 
interface. Since the consumers of my API only rely on batching as a 
performance optimization, I am currently invoking commands individually using 
the Execute method on the IRiakClient interface. I am hoping to improve on 
this though.

Any guidance would be appreciated as I am very new to Riak.
