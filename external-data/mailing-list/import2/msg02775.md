Here here. I'm working on that, too. There is a draft of the API here

What are you using to marshall to java objects? Jackson?

I've only had a brief look but I like it very much, thanks for making it and 
sharing it. We seem to have covered a lot of the same ground but it is great 
to have a diverse range of clients for different use cases. I'll pull the repo 
and have a more detailed look, I'm hoping you may have solved some of the 
problems I'm looking at already ;)
