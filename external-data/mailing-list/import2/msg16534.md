Is there a different set of documentation out there for installing, primarily
configuring RIAK-CS, RIAK, and Stanchion? Basically - there are typos here
and there, and the information is confusing, why don't they simply provide
the configuration files for people to download and simply ask them to change
the IP address?

Examples of typos:

 They ask to replace everywhere the IP addresses from 127.0.0.1 to your own
IP... cool, then they ask you to test things like:

 "curl http://localhost:8080/riak-cs/ping" ....but wait, didn't you just
say to change all the 127.0.0.1 IPs to your own??? localhost is not binding
to 8080... so it will not work (yes, yes - maybe all they want is for people
to buy their enterprise....)

 Here is another one among the same lines:

 curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/riak-cs/user \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -d '{"email":"ad...@admin.com", "name":"admin"}'

 Again 8080 on localhost... well - is anyone testing this stuff???? do
they even care to grow their user base...?

 It is rather frustrating... I also tried to install using the vagrant
one... yes - it almost seemed perfect... since they did all the work...
but... they forgot to mention that s3cmd assumes that authentication is
being done with new AWS API so we need to force V2 (signature\_v2 = True) -
also they forgot to mention that HTTPS is not enabled in the vagrant
fasttrack RIAK-CS - why make the user have to troubleshoot more? Well -
that's one way to get them to learn a bit or waste their time Googling for 
the answer...

 Despite of all of this - I haven't been able to install successfully on
my own on real servers (single server in the worse case) - correction, I was
able to install, start everything, but I can not create an admin user... so
now I am going to copy whatever is in the vagrant files and pull them over
to my physical systems...

 Yes - this is not a question - just hoping these guys can rectify the doc
issues - obviously not much QA going on their documentation - the stuff does
not work, that's a fact.

 Regards.
