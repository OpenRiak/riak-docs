Hi Gavin,

The multi\_backend\_prefix\_list feature is for Riak CS's use and is not
intended for general use. That being said, the following two configuration
lines will direct you to how Riak CS accomplishes this:

{add\_paths, ["/usr/lib/riak-cs/lib/riak\_cs-1.4.5/ebin"]},
{storage\_backend, riak\_cs\_kv\_multi\_backend},
