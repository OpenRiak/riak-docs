Hi Dan,

Apologizes for the delayed response.

I reproduced the HTTP 403 when `admin\_auth\_enabled` is set to `false`,
but successfully retrieved stats with it set to `true`:

$ riak-cs version
1.4.2
$ grep "admin\_auth\_enabled" /etc/riak-cs/app.config
 {admin\_auth\_enabled, true},
$ ./s3curl.pl --id admin --contentType application/json -- -s
--proxy1.0 localhost:8080 http://s3.amazonaws.com/riak-cs/stats
{"legend":["meter\_count","meter\_rate","latency\_mean","latency\_median","latency\_95","latency\_99"],"block\_get":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"block\_get\_retry":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"block\_put":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"block\_delete":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"service\_get\_buckets":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"bucket\_list\_keys":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"bucket\_create":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"bucket\_delete":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"bucket\_get\_acl":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"bucket\_put\_acl":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"object\_get":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"object\_put":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"object\_head":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"object\_delete":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"object\_get\_acl":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"object\_put\_acl":[0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"legend":["workers","overflow","size"],"request\_pool":[127,0,1],"bucket\_list\_pool":[5,0,0]}%

The following issue can be used to track the scenario where
`admin\_auth\_enabled` returns a 403 when set to `false`:
