Hi David,

AFAIK, bucket properties are shared via gossip chatter. That is why it is 
recommended that you modify the bucket defaults via the config file if you are 
going to have a lot of buckets with different params from the default. Bucket 
properties and the backends that buckets use are different. Properties play at 
the ring/gossip level and backends play at the node level. So, for instance you 
can have the same logical 'bucket' have two different backends on two different 
physical nodes, afaik.
