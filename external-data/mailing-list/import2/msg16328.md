Hi Sevilha! Welcome - I'm excited to hear about your first experience with 
Riak. If you're comfortable with Vagrant, you have a few options here: 
https://github.com/basho-labs/vagrant-riak-meta

If you'd prefer to test in AWS, you can search the store for Riak and find a 
2.1.1 release there. 

Either of those options are a good start.
