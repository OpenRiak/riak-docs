Unfortunately, I get the following error:

\* upload completely sent off: 49out of 49 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
< Vary: Accept-Encoding
< Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.10.0 (never breaks eye contact)
< Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2013 18:13:31 GMT
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 22

Error:
all\_nodes\_down
\* Connection #0 to host 192.168.2.25 left intact
\* Closing connection #0

Any ideas?
