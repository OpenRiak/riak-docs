Greetings Riak Users!

We've released the official .NET client for Riak.
It is a 2.0 compatible evolution of the Corrugated Iron .NET client.

It's available via nuget:

https://www.nuget.org/packages/RiakClient/

The github repo can be found here:

\*https://github.com/basho/riak-dotnet-client
\*

API docs are published here:

\*http://basho.github.io/riak-dotnet-client-api/
\*

We would like to give special thanks to Jeremiah Peschka and OJ Reeves for
their hard work on CorrugatedIron, and for passing on CI's stewardship to
Basho so we could continue its story.

Thanks!
Alex Moore
