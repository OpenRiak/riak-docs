Rohman,

In our case, the only nodes that are allowed to hit the Riak cluster are
those of our applications. We do not allow access to the Riak nodes from the
public Internet. Firewall rules are in place to prevent this in some cases,
and in others the Riak nodes themselves are on internal networks. In general
I think either of these approaches is sound (I'm happy to be corrected ;)).
Perhaps you should look into something similar?

Best regards

OJ
