v3 would be the “latest non-standard” version of this function. It works better 
than v2 for balancing nodes but it has a performance caveat with larger ring 
sizes, which is why we still default to v2. I will address the documentation 
issue of this, but for now the source code is the best documentation (see below 
for links).

So in the typical case, the default will be v2, via the `default\_wants\_claim` 
and `default\_choose\_claim` functions in `riak\_core\_claim.erl`. If you’re 
running a legacy ring, it will default to v1 instead.

I’ve put in a docs issue to get the documentation clarified.

Thanks,
