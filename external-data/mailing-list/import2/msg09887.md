I think the riak-dt branch of riak has got a bit stale and needs a rebase. I'll 
do that today and post back when I have it working.

Riak\_dt, or something like it \_is\_ still planned. We're working out how best to 
integrate CRDTs in general (and counters in particular) into Riak\_kv. In the 
meantime I'll fix up that experimental branch.
