I concur. This condition seems arbitrary to me and I'm not sure if there
is a good reason for it to exist. But it's there and the only way we could
remove it for you is to hot-load a new beam.

Riak Search uses term-based partitioning. It could be that you have some
terms that are more frequent than others which would account for some of
the difference.

No, instead of disabling Riak Search you'll want to take the nodes down one
at a time, remove the merge index data, restart. After doing this for all
nodes then re-index your data.

Again, don't bother disabling search. The key is to take the nodes down
because merge index caches stuff in memory.

Actually, I thought of another way to achieve the same result without
taking the nodes down. If you have a non-production cluster to test this
on that would be a good precaution. I'm 99% sure this should work without
issue.

1. Make sure no indexes are incoming, do this either at your client or
uninstall all search hooks

For each node:

2. Get a list of the MI Pids like in the manual compaction example
3. For each MI Pid call merge\_index:drop(MIPid)
3a. Verify the data files were removed on disk

After performing steps 2 & 3 on each node:

4. Re-write the objects you want indexed (of course remember to re-install
the hooks if you removed them in step 1)
