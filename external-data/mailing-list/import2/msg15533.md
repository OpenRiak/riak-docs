Hello,

I am trying to build a small demo app involving the Java Client and the Data 
types by following the official documentation.
However, map operations are not working. A fetch with the Java client always 
returns an empty map, writes create new maps, but they remain empty. 
In the source file that I attached, this yields a null pointer exception when 
doing the getRegister() in getLastName, for example.

I am using riak-client-2.0.0 and riak-pb-2.0.0.14.

Any hint for me?

 Annette
