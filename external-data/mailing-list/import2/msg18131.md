Hi Johan,

I'm assuming you're using the Java client, and the getValues method shown here:

https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/basho/riak/client/api/commands/kv/KvResponseBase.java#L80-L91

Yes. Please refer to the docs here:

https://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/developing/usage/conflict-resolution/java/#conflict-resolution-and-writes

Thanks -
