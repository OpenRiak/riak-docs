Hello all,

I am trying to understand Riak Key Value store as a whole to add new
replication algorithms. I moved around a lot of files for the "put" flow:
riak\_vnode\_master, riak\_kv\_put\_fsm, riak\_ensemble\_\*, etc. but still do not
understand it well.

Could anyone please suggest an approach or important files/findings?

I would really appreciate any help! Thanks a lot.
