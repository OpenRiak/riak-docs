For a work around you could use streaming and pagination.

Request smaller pages of data (i.e. sub 60 seconds worth) and use streaming to 
get the results to your client sooner.

In HTTP this would look like

http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/mybucket/index/test\_bin/myval?max\_results=10000&stream=true

your results will include a continuation like

 {"continuation":"g2gCYgAAFXttAAAABDU0OTk="}

and you can use that to get the next N results. Breaking your query up that way 
should duck the timeout.

Furthermore, adding &stream=true will mean the first results is received very 
rapidly.

I don't think the Ruby client is up to date for the new 2i features, but you 
could monkeypatch as before.

Cheers
