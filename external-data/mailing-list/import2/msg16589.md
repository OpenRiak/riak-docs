More likely not what I expected - I use the definition of the strongest
consistency guarantees = linearizability (from source -
https://cs.brown.edu/~mph/HerlihyW90/p463-herlihy.pdf)

or in other words if a user sends read request, the value obtained should
be at least that of the last write acknowledged to any other user (or later
write request) before the read request was sent to database.
