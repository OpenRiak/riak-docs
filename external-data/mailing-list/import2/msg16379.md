>From http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/theory/concepts/: 

"In general, large numbers of buckets within a Riak cluster is not a problem. 
In practice, there are two potential restrictions on the maximum number of 
buckets a Riak cluster can handle" 

Is there any further, more specific documentation on this that I could read? 

I am interested in understanding the upper limits of the number of buckets for 
say, a 10 node, ring\_size = 64 (or 128) LevelDB backed Riak cluster.
