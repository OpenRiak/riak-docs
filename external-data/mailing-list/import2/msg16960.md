That’s right! No one ever had a problem with those products.

Fact is riak has been described as “boring” and “like plumbing” and “we forget 
it’s there” by numerous customers. It is so reliable the UK health service 
selected us and had the most uptime they’ve \_ever\_ had since. The danish health 
service also depend on Riak.

\_ALL\_ software (even NASA super-bug-free software) has operational parameters, 
Riak is no exception. But reliable is kind of our thing. Hence my original 
answer.

Of course you should compare and evaluate other software as appropriate.

Cheers

Russell
