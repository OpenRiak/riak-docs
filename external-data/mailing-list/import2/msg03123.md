i am having some trouble in querying more than 20K entries.. when i tried to 
query around 100K entries, i got empty array.. but when i tried around 60K 
entries, i got "InternalError: script stack space quota is exhausted".. are 
there any tweaks that i could apply or anything that i should do that would 
allow me to query around a million or more entries at a time? btw, i am using 
php..

please advice.. thank you in advance..
