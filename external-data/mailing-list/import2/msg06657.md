The mem\_allocated stat reports the amount of memory allocated for the
system (not just Erlang). This number is returned by the memsup module:
http://erldocs.com/R14B02/os\_mon/memsup.html

There are also a series of stats prefixed with "memory\_" which provide
memory information for the Riak node.
