Hello,

I wanted to understand the production requirements for using Riak as a 
non-persistent ephemeral data store. In particular the following questions 
relate to using Riak with “memory” configured as storage backend:


1. What is the “platform\_data\_dir” used for when memory is used as 
storage backend? Is it only needed for active anti-entropy and cluster 
metadata? Do I need to persist this data i.e. if a node goes down and restarts 
in this configuration, is persistence of data in “platform\_data\_dir” required.

2. What is the minimum memory requirement of an empty Riak node in this 
configuration?

3. What is the minimum disk and CPU requirement of a Riak node in this 
configuration?
