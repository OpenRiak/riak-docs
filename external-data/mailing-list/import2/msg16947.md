Hi Eugene,

Unfortunately, the write-once put path does not support pre-commit hooks, which 
the 2i system uses for indexing. So secondary indexing is not currently 
supported with write-once. However, the indexing through yokozuna (Riak Search 
2.0) is done in the vnode back-end, and indexing with write-once is supported 
there.
