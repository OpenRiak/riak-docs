Which version of Riak CS are you using? If it's 1.5.3 or later,
"storage\_calc\_timeout" in "riak\_cs" section should be used instead of
"mapred\_timeout" because it won't work [1]. This is undocumented, but
we should've documented this.

Moreover, in CS 1.5.3 or later "mapred\_timeout" or "timeout" in
"riakc" section won't work due to the same reason - all names of
configuration knobs can be found in code [2]. I hope if you don't read
Erlang, this code might be simple enough to understand what's
configurable.
