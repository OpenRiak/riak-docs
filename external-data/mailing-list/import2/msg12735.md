Ok, this is a good question. And something we've been working on.
 
1.4 had counters, 2.0 has counters. Are they the same? Yes and no.
 
In 2.0 we add bucket types. We decided that CRDTs in 2.0 should take advantage 
of bucket types. The reason being that there is no sensible way to merge across 
types (how do you merge a Map with a Set? (we thought of a few ways, but non 
were intuitive)) It comes down to the reason for CRDTs: no conflicts, no 
siblings. If we allow different types in the same bucket then you can create 
the same key with two different types, which means siblings types: just as 
complex as siblings.
 
So, we restrict you to one CRDT type per bucket. But in 1.4 we didn't have this 
restriction. And we need to support 1.4 style counters.
 
If you use the 1.4 API or store counters in the default (untyped) bucket using 
the 2.0 API then you're interoperable between versions.
 
Sorry if it seems confusing. The point is that as a client developer you can 
access 1.4 counters through the 2.0 API by using the default bucket type OR 
continue support for the 1.4 API (or bolth.) Whichever you prefer.
 
I realise this might be an information overload, so feel free to ask questions 
about anything I wasn't clear enough about.

Cheers

Russell
