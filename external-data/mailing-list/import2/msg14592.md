Hey Riak Users,

We've just pushed a release candidate of the official Python client to
PyPi [1]. This package includes support for Riak 2.0.0 RC1 features,
including security, data types, Search 2.0 (Yokozuna), and bucket
types. Documentation on the new APIs is incomplete [2], but you can
refer to the official Riak documentation [3] for overviews and
tutorials with Python-specific examples. We will be polishing the API
documentation for the final release.

Please note that this release adds a new dependency on pyOpenSSL [4],
which supports a wider range of TLS options than the standard library
ssl package. This is only used if you enable Riak 2.0's new security
features, but will be installed regardless when you install the
client. You may receive a warning when importing the client code if
your version of OpenSSL is too old or doesn't expose TLS v1.2.

Significant changes that are not related to new Riak features:

- Previously-marked deprecated methods/features have been removed. [5]
- PB is now the default protocol for new clients. [6] HTTP is still
 available, but this is part of our larger effort to phase out HTTP
 in our official libraries.

There are some significant known-issues with this package that you
should be aware of:

- Strongly-consistent keys will work (the API is similar enough to
 regular K/V), but if a CAS update operation fails, your application
 code will have to perform the retry. This will be wrapped in an API
 for the final release.
- We have had multiple reports of connections leaking while iterating
 over streamed responses [7], these will be resolved by final
 release.
- Although the behavior hasn't changed, we will be attempting to
 address a number of Unicode issues before final release [8].

For all other known issues, please refer to the issue tracker on
Github [9]. Milestones in the tracker refer to \*Riak\* releases
although the client version is different. We encourage you to report
any issues you find with the release candidate client.

Cheers!
