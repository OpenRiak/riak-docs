The issue, sadly, hasn't been updated with what we know. It's mentioned in 
Zeeshan's gist, which should be moved to the main issue. But the issue is 
surrounding the AAE tree dropping documents, though we still aren't sure why. 
It initially appeared when adding/removing nodes, but noticed it could be 
reproduced by simply running AAE.

We'll update the issue.
