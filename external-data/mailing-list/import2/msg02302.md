Is there a tutorial or a walk-through available for testing with Rspec & 
Ripple? Currently ploughing our way through 
https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/tree/41a7f741603ea186d97064ff3ef542238a078135/ripple/spec
 attempting to make the in memory test server work. And of course, our Rspec 
setup is a little different (mocha stubbing, shoulda, etc.) We'll probably get 
there eventually any docs or cribsheets would be helpful.

TIA M.
