Riak Users,

It was a little late due to the holidays but Yokozuna 0.13.0 is
here. This release brings an upgrade to Solr, support for indexing
Riak Data Structures, the ability to reload indexes via `riak attach`,
and includes a query performance boost. See the release notes for more
details.

https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/develop/docs/RELEASE\_NOTES.md#0130

Given the number of breaking changes since the Riak 2.0.0pre5 release
I recommended using the 0.13.0 source package until a new Riak
pre-release is made. This way the documentation can be followed without
trouble. See the install instructions for more detail.
