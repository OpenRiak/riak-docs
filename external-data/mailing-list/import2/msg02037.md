I am not sure if this is any help but I have uploaded a protocol buffer pool 
client for riak which requires you to pass a client\_id for each operation.

https://github.com/DangerDawson/riakc\_pb\_pool

It is very very basic, but does most of the useful things:

 - put / get / delete
 - riak disconnects, 
 - Clients that die after leasing a riak connection ( connection is 
returned to the pool )
 - Dynamically increasing the size of the connection pool
 - Queueing requests if there are no connections available
 - Useful Statistics

Of course the documentation is very sparse and needs improving, which I will 
get round to.
