Hi Riak Team -
 To begin with, thanks for the wonderful tool and putting it out there.

 As part of doing benchmarking for some storage engines, came across the
leveldb store being the backend for Riak discussed here -
http://basho.com/blog/technical/2011/07/01/Leveling-the-Field/ . This is
certainly promising. I was wondering if there is a specific doc/wiki that
details how to get the version of Riak ( 1.0.2 , as per the Downloads page
) and leveldb binary installation to work together and install LevelDB as
the storage backend for Riak.

 Any pointers to doc / appropriate config changes would be useful. Thanks
!
