If you’re evaluating RiakCS vs. Ceph you might want to toss LeoFS[1] in the mix 
and give it a run. Just as RiakCS it is a dynamo inspired system build in 
Erlang and comes with the same advantages and disadvantages. But unlike RiakCS 
it is pretty much exclusive a Object Store so can take a few different 
optimizations for this kind of work that might not be possible in a general 
purpose database as Riak (this is my personal guess not a research founded 
conclusion). The team is (much) smaller then bash (obviously) but they’re a 
very nice and responsive bunch. I ended up using it as a s3 backend for 
Project-FiFo due to it’s performance characteristics. With current releases I 
manage to get a sigle file upload speed of ~1.2GB/s using gof3r[2] (this might 
be a client limitation but I haven’t had time to investigate the details).
