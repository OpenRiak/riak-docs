Riak Recap for 6/1


1) @johnylynch released a slide preso called "Rolling with Riak"
yesterday. It's only 23 slides, but it's worth every single one.

Check it out here ---> http://www.slideshare.net/johnthethird/rolling-with-riak

2) On the heels of @frank06's Node + Riak presentation, @kurokikaze
wrote up a lengthy piece that starts with a great overview of Riak and
then goes into some code examples using riak.js. It's well worth the
read. [NOTE: This one is in Russian, so unless you're fluent you'll
have to use the translate feature in the upper left which gets the job
done).

Post is here ---> http://kuroikaze85.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/node-js-riak/

3) jharjono raised an issue in #riak relating to list keys hanging
when a Riak node is down. As promised, a fix for this was pushed to
tip yesterday.

 Check out commits 1294 and 1296 for more details ---->

4) freshtonic, seancribbs, moonpolysoft, and justinsheehy had a
lengthy conversation in #riak about post commit hook, buckets, erlang,
and millions of objects.
