Hi Daniel,

Riak CS uses multi by default. By default the manifests are stored in leveldb 
and the blobs/chunks are stored in bitcask. If you're looking to force 
everything to level you should remove multi and use level as the backend 
setting. As Luke noted elsewhere, this configuration hasn't been fully tested 
and is not supported. 

Off the top of my head, take a look at the email Martin (?) sent about his 
modified level backend a few weeks ago for reasons why using level for data 
chunks may not be the best idea at this time. 

Thanks,
Alexander
