I've been using Riak for a few weeks now. I'm using the PHP API Client 
(http://basho.github.com/riak-php-client/).
 
I noticed it was giving me errors when I tried to add indexes, so I changed the 
backend from bitcask to leveldb (Does bitcask not allow indexing i.e. for 
secondary indexes?). So after the change, adding indexes and index search seems 
to be working now, but all my earlier data is not longer accessible.
 
How do I make my old data work with a new backend?!
 
Thanks in advance.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
