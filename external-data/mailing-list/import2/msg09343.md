There's no way to specifically delete a bucket - buckets are, in part, a
logical namespace. Once you delete every key in a bucket the bucket will
effectively be deleted. The easiest thing to do in a test environment is to
run list keys on the bucket. This is a terrible idea for a production
system since list keys can potentially put pretty high load on your system.

See
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/apis/http/#Bucket-Operationsfor
confirmation from Basho.
