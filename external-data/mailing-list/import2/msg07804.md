The major difference between these two is the first is executing a binary, 
which has to basically create everything (connection, payload, etc) every time 
through the loop. The second does not - it creates the client once, then 
iterates over it keeping the same client and presumably the same connection as 
well. That makes a huge difference.

I would not use curl to do performance testing. What you probably want is 
something like your python script that will work on many threads/processes at 
once (or fire them up many times).
