There is no event loop in libcurl. That was my point. It can use several
different event loops - libev, libevent , etc. If "libriakclient" uses
libevent only, then I have a tougher time integrating it with other event
loops. Haven't looked into the code much, but the "core" riak-client stuff
(PBC, etc) could/should be separate from the asynchronous implementation -
even if a libevent implementation was included.
