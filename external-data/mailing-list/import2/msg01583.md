You either take the hit at write time or at query time. Personally, I think 
this is easier to understand and manage, but it may also depend on what other 
queries you want to run. For example, if your other queries are more focused 
on the individual visitor, it might make sense to have a list of 
alternative\_ids in the Visitor class, instead of having something (experience 
or alternative) link to it. The key takeaway I'm trying to lead you to is that 
data types that are effectively "joins" are less efficient/useful in Riak.

Our community manager has some better documentation in the oven, but there are 
a number of them in these two files:

(JS) https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/blob/master/priv/mapred\_builtins.js
(Erlang) 
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/blob/d4c6930d97fb109f9dcb3c73a99747ca217275c7/src/riak\_kv\_mapreduce.erl
