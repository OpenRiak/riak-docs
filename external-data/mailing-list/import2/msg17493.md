Hello,

I think the documentation for multi backend could use some
improvement. Once you configure Riak to use the "multi" storage
backend, you must then \*name\* backends to be used by your bucket
types:

Here is a configuration that you can use, that would create two
backends, one using the memory backend that is \*named\*
"my\_memory\_backend", and one using the leveldb backend that is named
"my\_leveldb\_backend":

In riak.conf:

storage\_backend = multi
multi\_backend.my\_memory\_backend.storage\_backend = memory
multi\_backend.my\_leveldb\_backend.storage\_backend = leveldb

The following is an example of setting a leveldb-specific setting for
the "my\_leveldb\_backend" named backend:

multi\_backend.my\_leveldb\_backend.leveldb.maximum\_memory.percent = 70

Then, you associate your "os\_cache" bucket type with
"my\_memory\_backend" this way:

riak-admin bucket-type create os\_cache '{"props": {"write\_once":
true,"backend":"my\_memory\_backend","n\_val":2,"r":1,"w":1,"dw":1}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate os\_cache

Please let me know if this resolves your issue. You may have to remove
the content's of Riak's data and ring directories to overwrite your
old settings.

I have filed an issue in GitHub to improve the documentation for
multi-backend: https://github.com/basho/basho\_docs/issues/2123
