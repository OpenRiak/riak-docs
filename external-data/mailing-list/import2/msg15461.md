Hello Zsolt,

Whether or not it is correct or valuable for you to use delete
operations is (as with many features of Riak) largely dependent on
your use-case. Deletes in the strongly consistent mode are much less
valuable than deletes in the eventually consistent mode because keys
are never reaped from strongly consistent buckets. You might be able
to reclaim some disk space with a strongly consistent delete by
shrinking the size of the stored value, but that key will never be
removed from the system. The next time a GET is performed for that
key, the return value should look like the return value for a key that
never existed though, so if those are the semantics you're after it
might still be correct to delete keys.

I hope that answered your question.
Best,
-Drew
