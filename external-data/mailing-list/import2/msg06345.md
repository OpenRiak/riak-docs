Riak Recap for January 16 - 19
=======================

1) John Repko wrote an informative and inspiring blog post about
getting up and running with Riak. (Thanks for sharing, John!)

\* Read here --->
http://www.pikasoft.com/journal/2012/1/15/you-only-live-twice-basho-and-riak.html

2) Looks like Riak made it into the list of approved features for the
Fedora 17 release. (I'm sure they are probably still looking for
assistance in completing the addition.)

\* Details here ---> https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/17/FeatureList

3) Mathias Meyer is giving a talk on Riak at the NoSQL User Group in
Cologne on February 1st.

\* Details here ---> http://www.doodle.com/nd76y62z2i442iv2

4) This was already on the Mailing List but I wanted to send it along
in case those of you who just read the Recaps missed is it -> Peter
Bailis wrote up some details about the research he and his colleagues
are working on at UC Berkeley related to consistency in Dynamo
systems.

5) Anyone out there using Riak with Spring? Or familiar with the existing code?

\* Question from a perspective user --->
http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?121877-Status-of-Spring-Data-Riak&s=04d69c4d6e1a977a5dc97474f43174bc&p=398046#post398046

6) The team at HighGroove did a Riak tech talk today at their offices
and managed to get the video online already. (Jump to about 3 minutes
in to get around the intro chatter.)

\* Watch here --->

7) Another reminder about ScaleConf in South Africa next week (that
Basho is sponsoring and at which I will be speaking). Hope to see some
of you there.
