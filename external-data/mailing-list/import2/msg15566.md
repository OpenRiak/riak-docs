Toby,

Glad to hear you gained some.

For disk usage gaps, I'd recommend smaller leeway\_seconds, like an
hour or even less, depending on the average object size and read
concurrency. leeway seconds is just for assuring long-running download
not being interrupted by concurrent overwrite or deletion and GC. And
increasing gc\_max\_workers in app.config might help the speed of
reclaiming disk usage, eating some disk IOPS for more parallel
deletion. The default concurrency is 5 for 1.5 series.
delete\_concurrency also might help - by multiplying the concurrency
whose default is 1.

Another possibility is large number of siblings. If you have frequent
and concurrent upload against same key, it might create fair number of
siblings (and parallel manifests in single sibling), which means
rather large Riak object in leveldb. This might also affect the
performance either when is number is large as logged in CS, or the
object size is small. When objects are small, the overhead of fetching
whole related data (buckets, users, metadata in the manifest) cannot
be ignored. That'd affect byte through put, maybe.

As you may see in github, we're working on CS 2.0 which works with
Riak 2.0, so please stay tuned!
