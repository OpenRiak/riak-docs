Hey,

Which ports are used in a Riak cluster?
We now that port 8099 (by default) is used for handoff or port 8087 (by 
default) is used for HTTP interface.
But on which port do Riak nodes talk with each other. For example when a new 
record comes to one node, that node needs to talk with other nodes on cluster 
to find where this record should be saved. Question is on which port number 
Riak nodes talk with each other internally. I guess it should be a random port 
number. Am I right?

Thanks,
