&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Hellow, I am faily new to RIAK, and am experiencing a very peculiar problem. 
&gt; We are conducting a RIAK evaluation to see if it fits our purposes, because 
&gt; on paper it seams to be a perfect fit.
&gt; 
&gt; To create an evaluating scenario i have setup 5 nodes under vmware(the 
&gt; network is bridged)
&gt; 
&gt; The cluster runs just fine, and i can down nodes for maintenance as expected 
&gt; perfectly, while the cluster keeps serving the data as expected. Node reboots 
&gt; are also tolerated well by the cluster as expected.
&gt; 
&gt; But if a note unexpectedly fails (hard power off or sudden network 
&gt; disconnection) all nodes get exited and the full cluster becomes inaccessible 
&gt; until the failed node is back up or until i manually mark the failed node as 
&gt; down with risk-admin.
&gt; 
&gt; I was expecting a cluster (n3) with 5 nodes to simply tolerate 1 node failure 
&gt; transparently. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is there something i may be doing wrong? Is this the expected behavior?
&gt; 
&gt; I would appreciate any light anyone could shine on this subject.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Gil
