Are you looking for something like this?

Ideally you would run a reverse proxy in front of riak. So riak would be your 
store and the reverse proxy would serve files directly to the client...

&gt; It looks like these high wait times occur when the request hits a node
&gt; which does not store the requested file. The node will download the
&gt; whole file into memory and after that he will send the data to the
&gt; client. How about directly pipe'ing the download to the output stream
&gt; or (even better) redirect the client to a node with the file so the
&gt; overall network usage decreases?

&gt;&gt; I am looking for a software to host millions of files in the order of
&gt;&gt; 2-20MB for web serving. A few (~5%) files are "hot" and accessed
&gt;&gt; heavily but most of the files are cold. The system is going to work
&gt;&gt; like a big cache and therefore I need to make sure that the cluster
&gt;&gt; won't go out of space while new files are beeing added. I'd like to
&gt;&gt; store the last time a file was accessed and delete the least accessed
&gt;&gt; files to make sure there is always 20-30% free space in the cluster.
&gt;&gt; This system is currently spread across alot of different standalone
&gt;&gt; servers and serves a few gbit of bandwidth.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is this possible with riak? Is there anything I should take into 
&gt;&gt; consideration?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I did a little testing with a 4 node cluster. Basically with the
&gt;&gt; default configuration, I've only changed the ip addresses and disabled
&gt;&gt; nagle buffering for http. When I want to access a 20MB file through
&gt;&gt; the REST API it sometimes takes 4-8 seconds until any data is beeing
&gt;&gt; sent to the client. I've made use of the "r" parameter (r=1) and the
&gt;&gt; wait time improved a little bit but is still unacceptable for
&gt;&gt; production use. Is there some config option I am missing here to get
&gt;&gt; the requested file without such high wait times?
&gt;&gt;
