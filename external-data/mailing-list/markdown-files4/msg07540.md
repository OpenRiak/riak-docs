Nam,

To recap the upshot of our offline chat tonight:
Though the leave operations on your cluster progressed fine, in the future I
would just take the damaged nodes down, do the repair like I mentioned in
the earlier post in this thread, and bring the nodes back up. No membership
changes should be required.
