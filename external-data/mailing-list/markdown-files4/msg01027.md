&gt; The plan was to create a Riak client connection for every request coming in

&gt; round-robin). I was also thinking of building something into this mechanism 
&gt; which would be able to manage an open list of potential target nodes to 
&gt; connect to and handle when new nodes join the cluster or when nodes go 
&gt; offline in an effort to make sure that the web application will "always" know 
&gt; of a valid node to connect to.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this seem like overkill? Would the effort in implementing such behaviour 
&gt; be worth the reward?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks for any insights.
