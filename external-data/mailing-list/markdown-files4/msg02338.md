My benchmarks with Riak against Redis showed Riak is fast, but it's
never going to be as fast for caching as an in-memory only store that
doesn't have to do coordination. That said if your data set is larger
than RAM, Riak will likely be faster as it will scale to handle that
better.

&gt; think Riak could perform this in theory, but is Riak fast enough?
