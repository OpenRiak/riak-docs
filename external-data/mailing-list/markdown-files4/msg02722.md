So a question about when to add new nodes. I'm looking at the output of
this script and the output of riak-admin status to attempt to figure out
if it's time to grow a cluster.

I have 4 nodes 1024 partitions replication factor 3, currently with a
single bitcask single bucket where both the key and the value are 36 bytes.

According to the bitcask spreadsheet the overhead per key is 40 bytes

The current key counts/memory are

 key\_counts mem\_total mem\_allocated (key\_count\*76)
node1 22381785 25269010432 21015953408 1701015660
node2 22378092 25269010432 14076137472 1700734992
node3 22373770 25269010432 21565509632 1700406520
node4 22382394 25269010432 21493731328 1701061944

node2 failed at some point and was replaced with with a new node.

So there is some oddness here I don't understand. According to the
calculated value I should see about 1.7GB per box used, instead I see
21GB on most machines except for the one which was restarted which has
14GB. From looking at memory it seems like I should be adding some nodes
real soon or amount allocated will hit the total amount. Or maybe there's
a memory leak which will reduce the amount of memory (as with node2)?

I'm just trying to figure out why I seem to almost be out of memory with
23 million documents when the Bitcask capacity planning spreadsheet seems
to suggest I should be able to have 282 million with 20 GiB of free Ram.

Confused,

-Anthony
