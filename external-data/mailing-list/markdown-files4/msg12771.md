Here is an updated 2 hour graph of the same "X-Small" 5-node cluster,
after having performed all the Linux tuning steps I had missed first
time around. Also added ntpd service to all nodes. Looks like slightly
better throughput & latency, but a much cleaner graph overall, and it
should "burst" much better:

Here is the same cluster rebooted as "Medium" Azure VMs, same
benchmark settings except: 8 workers, shorter duration. Not sure why
it has errors, yet:

Anyways- back to work for me!!!

&gt; Hey, something that is impressive about Riak is how well it performs
&gt; even on super low end cloud virtualization (unlike for example,
&gt; couchbase, which hardly runs at all unless you have quad cores per
&gt; each node)
&gt;
&gt; Having so much fun benchmarking, it's really distracting me from coding!
&gt;
&gt; the cluster : 5 nodes on Windows Azure cloud
&gt; Ubuntu 12.04, Riak 1.2.4
&gt; node are xsmall vm (1 shared cpu core, 768 mb ram)
&gt;
&gt; The xmall vms are only $15/month and they are not recommended for
&gt; "production". but in a 5 node riak cluster, it's really nothing to
&gt; scoff at!
&gt;
&gt; I suspect the main bottleneck is not the cpu or disk, rather I think
&gt; it's the each xsmall node is allowed only 5Mbit/sec on the ethernet.
&gt;
&gt; Here is a basho\_bench graph, if anyone feels like viewing it
&gt; https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22076075/summary-xsmall-bitcask-5nodes-20min.png
&gt;
&gt; note the basho bench was running on a quad core machine on the same
&gt; vlan with 5 workers.
