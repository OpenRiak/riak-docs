Mike,

Riak has no built-in caching of keys, but Bitcask (which is the default storage 
engine) will use up as much filesystem cache as you can give it, effectively 
giving you in-memory caching without having to specifically implement it. If 
you want something a bit more explicit, Innostore (which uses Embedded InnoDB) 
lets you set how much RAM you want to consume for caching disk pages. In 
general, we have found Bitcask to be performant under more production 
conditions than Innostore.

Whether you need to cache items in your application is a different concern, 
largely based on your performance needs. I'd suggest modeling and benchmarking 
typical requests from your application to determine whether you need a caching 
layer between your app and Riak.

&gt; Does Riak or riak\_core do any memory caching of the database on a

&gt; 
&gt; eg, MachineX has 3 partitions on it... does it cache those partitions in 
&gt; memory for access or pull them off storage each time?
&gt; 
&gt; eg, will I need to hook in a memcache-like sytem/layer on top of it, since 
&gt; RAM access is faster than storage mediums?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
