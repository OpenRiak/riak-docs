Hi Christian,

&gt; Are you running key or bucket listings? 
&gt; Are you running secondary index queries or mapreduce jobs? 
Nope, we only do com.basho.riak.client.bucket.Bucket.fetch() and .store().
There's no other usages of Riak client library in our code. 

&gt; Can you confirm you have disabled swap?
Yes.

&gt; Are you monitoring riak statistics? Do you have a graph of the latencies
&gt; you can share? 
We're monitoring Riak stats by parsing http://:8098/stats response. 
These are graphs taken for the last 3 hours. Red-green-blue mean three nodes
in the cluster.

If needed, I can share complete output from the stats.

Thanks,
 Kirill
