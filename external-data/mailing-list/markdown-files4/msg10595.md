Matt,


How often is this MapReduce query being run? Is the execution of this
MapReduce query done in a controlled manner (for instance, not initiated by
users of your application)?

The actual use case of MapReduce queries are important in determining

Thanks,

John Caprice

&gt; Hi list,

&gt; I have a non-trivial map reduce query which traverses links between
&gt; objects across several map phases, constructing a composite object enroute.
&gt; One of our links is one-to-many, so I use a reduce phase to flatten my set
&gt; of objects at the end.
&gt;
&gt; Would a query of this type be better done as a smaller M/R query to get
&gt; the base set of objects, and then multiple concurrent gets for the related
&gt; objects? Is it sensible to do map reduce jobs with many map and reduce
&gt; phases?
&gt;
&gt; I appreciate this question is somewhat open ended, but any input would be
&gt; welcome.
