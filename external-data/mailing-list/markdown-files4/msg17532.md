Hi All,

It's been more than a year since the End of Public Updates for Java 7, and
we're interested in dropping support for it as well. The only issue is that
since it was so widely used, some of you may need to use it for new
projects.

We'd like anybody that is stuck on Java 7 to leave a thumbs down on the
Github issue, and if you'd like to cast down Java 7, leave a thumbs up on
the issue.

Thanks,
