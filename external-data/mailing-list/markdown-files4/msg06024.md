You could certainly implement the necessary chunking and such in
client libraries. However, it's a pretty big set of functionality and
getting it to work right with in partitioned circumstances (i.e. with
siblings) can be a challenge. As such, I don't expect that to be part
of the standard client libraries anytime soon.
