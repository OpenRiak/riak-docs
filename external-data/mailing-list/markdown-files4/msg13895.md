Hi List,

I'm currently evaluating the possibilities to migrate our mysql-based 
image storage to something which actually scales and is easier to maintain.


Among different distributed file systems (like ceph, openstack swift) I 
was looking at riak as we already have a riak cluster for storing our 
users messages.


As we are only storing quite stripped down versions of our users photos, 
the average size of the photos is only about 30-40kb, there might be 
some above 100KB though. But all are less than 1MB.


As our objects are quite small and I don't need anything besides getting 
the binary for a key I want to use riak without riak CS. Is this a good 
or bad idea?


The current storage (which needs to be migrated) in MySQL has about 35 
million entries which consume 1.1TB of space.


Any ideas or suggestions?

Ingo
