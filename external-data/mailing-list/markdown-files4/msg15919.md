&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I try to use the riak search java client, specifically the Search.Builder 
&gt; class, like the following 
&gt; 
&gt; Search search = new Search.Builder("test", "\_yz\_rb:accounts AND email:" + 
&gt; [user-email]).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; "[user-email]" is what user entered in the login form, my question is about 
&gt; sql injection, it seems like the java search client api doesn't prevent sql 
&gt; injection, are there any other api/methods that I can use to prevent this? 
&gt; Thank you

Hello Jason,

Search is not SQL; queries are specified in the Solr [1] query syntax so 
they’re not vulnerable to a SQL injection attack, given the basis of a SQL 
injection attack is to end a query and start a new one using unvalidated 
syntax. While it’s not directly the same thing, in the same class of attacks 
it’s possible for a user to add additional criteria to the query given the way 
you’ve written your search query. I highly recommend you sanitize your inputs 
before passing them to the query builder.
