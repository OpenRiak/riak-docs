You can't delete a bucket. Period. You have to iterate over each key in a 
bucket.

&gt; Hi~@list,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm new to riak. When I use HTTP API to delete a bucket, I got a response as 
&gt; following.
&gt; HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed [Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.9.0 
&gt; (someone had painted it blue), Date: Wed, 21 Dec 2011 05:24:33 GMT, 
&gt; Content-Length: 0, Allow: HEAD, GET, PUT]
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a way to make Delete operation allowed?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Jammy
