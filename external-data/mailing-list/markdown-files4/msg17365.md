Hi Humberto,

I saw that you also opened a github issue about this (
https://github.com/basho/erlang\_js/issues/61), and that you were pointed to
this pull request (https://github.com/basho/erlang\_js/pull/58) that may fix
the issue for you.

The development engineers are working on a OTP-18 compatible code base and
a release planned for later this year should work with OTP-18. According to
the program managers this will also then include OTP-18 compatible versions
of Erlang based client libraries.

Please bear with us while the development work is being done.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
