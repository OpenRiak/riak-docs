Hello, 

We are currently evaluating Riak for an application that will store large 
amounts of data in a write-heavy pattern. We'd like to pack many disks into 
each machine. Currently, it appears that Bitcask uses exactly one directory to 
store data. What is the best way to have it use multiple disks? Is this 
something Innostore would handle better?

We'd like to avoid RAID since we'll be paying for redundancy at a higher level 
with Riak (N=3, etc.).

We'd also like to avoid a JBOD type setup where a single disk failure brings 
the whole node down, as we'll obviously be increasing those odds with each disk.

What I'm wondering is, can each node distribute its vnodes across many disks? 
And if one of those disks fails, will Riak handle that appropriately (i.e., the 
other vnodes continue to operate normally and hand-off data when the new disk 
comes online)?

Thanks!
