Hi Petter,

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to use Riak, but counters is a must in this project. They are so 
&gt; handy :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to build the riak-dt, but the build-system seems broken. I get this 
&gt; when i do make devrel:
&gt; 
&gt; ERROR: generate failed while processing /Users/petter/erlang/riak/rel: 
&gt; {'EXIT',{{badmatch,{error,"luke: : Missing application directory."}},
&gt; [{rebar\_reltool,generate,2,[]},
&gt; {rebar\_core,run\_modules,4,[]},
&gt; {rebar\_core,execute,5,[]},
&gt; {rebar\_core,process\_dir0,6,[]},
&gt; {rebar\_core,process\_dir,4,[]},
&gt; {rebar\_core,process\_commands,2,[]},
&gt; {rebar,main,1,[]},
&gt; {escript,run,2,[{file,"escript.erl"},{line,741}]}]}}
&gt; 
&gt; Any clues?

I think the riak-dt branch of riak has got a bit stale and needs a rebase. I'll 
do that today and post back when I have it working.

&gt; 
&gt; The riak-dt does also seem a little bit forgotten - no commits in a couple of 
&gt; months. Is it still planned?

Riak\_dt, or something like it \_is\_ still planned. We're working out how best to 
integrate CRDTs in general (and counters in particular) into Riak\_kv. In the 
meantime I'll fix up that experimental branch.

Cheers

Russell

&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Petter
