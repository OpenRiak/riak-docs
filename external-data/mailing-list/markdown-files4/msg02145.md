in your m/r you just need to pop off the first or last item in an
array depending on how you sort. no?

&gt; I figured I would run into this when I thought about implementing a min and

&gt;
&gt; So basically, I always end up with two in my result: the first one I come 
&gt; across, because I have nothing to compare it to and don't know if this key is 
&gt; the min/max, and the real min/max, which is the second entry.
&gt;
&gt; I could work around this by using a reduce that only takes the last one in 
&gt; the set, but I'd still like to only return a single result from the filter. 
&gt; Not sure this is possible as it stands, however.
&gt;
&gt; What are your thoughts?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
