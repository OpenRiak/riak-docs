Hi Simon,

Quick answer: the more (ports open), the merrier. At least 6.

As these are Erlang specific settings, I recommend having a look at the
official answer [0].

&gt; Hi,

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In the security documentation here:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/security/
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Instructions are given for how to limit the port ranges used for internode
&gt; communications. E.g.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; { kernel, [
&gt;
&gt; {inet\_dist\_listen\_min, 6000},
&gt;
&gt; {inet\_dist\_listen\_max, 7999}
&gt;
&gt; ]},
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Are there any recommendations on how many ports should be allowed. Iâ€™m
&gt; assume this is related to the number of nodes in the cluster, and possible
&gt; some details of the clients.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone provide guidance on this?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Simon.
