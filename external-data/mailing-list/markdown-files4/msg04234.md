I've been told that there is going to be a map reduce input function,much
like how Riak search can serve as the input for a mapreduce query.

&gt; This is a pretty amazing feature. Will probably result in some pretty

&gt;
&gt; Can you (or are there plans to) return the objects instead of just the
keys?
&gt; Can you use a filter with a map() function?
&gt;
&gt; Any target date for the "beta for the adventurous"? :)
