&gt; Hello Riak fans,
&gt;
&gt; Jeremiah and I are happy to announce the latest release of
&gt; CorrugatedIron[1], our .NET client for Riak.
&gt;
&gt; In this version we've fixed a couple of nagging issues to do with
&gt; Map/Reduce, deprecated a couple of unused APIs, and made some other
&gt; adjustments which will hopefully make your Riak venture in .NET land a
&gt; little more enjoyable. We've also added some functionality which should
&gt; hopefully improve the experience for those wanting to do crazy stuff like
&gt; listing keys.
&gt;
&gt; Full details are in the release notes[2]. The package is available on
&gt; Nuget[3] and you can grab the source from Github[4].
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to everyone who was involved in this release, particularly the
&gt; community members involved in the discussion and raising the bugs. It's
&gt; great to have input from a wider audience, we sure hope it continues.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt; OJ & Jeremiah
