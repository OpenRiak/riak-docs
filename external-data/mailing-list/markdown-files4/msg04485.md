Afternoon, Evening, Morning to All -

Here's a great Recap to take you into the weekend: blog posts, slides,
videos, new code, and more.

Also, to all our Riak users who happen to be on the East Coast of the
US this weekend: stay safe.

Enjoy.

Riak Recap for August 22 - 26
======================

1) A video of Rusty Klophaus' Secondary Indexing Talk from OSCON made
it onto Youtube. (The video quality is not the best, but it gets the
job done.)

\* Watch here ---&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uExMXa4t8eg

2) Joseph Lambert has two new Riak-related repos up on GitHub that are
definitely worth keeping an eye on. (He should also get some points
for one of the better GitHub nicks I've seen in a while.)

3) Cody Soyland and Sean Cribbs collaborated to put together a Riak
Post Commit Hook that send writes to ZeroMQ.

\* Details here ---&gt;

4) The slides from the talk I gave on Wednesday night at the Seattle
Scalability Meetup are now online.

\* Check them out here ---&gt;

5) Adam Schepis wrote a script to update Riak Config Files (and turned
it into a blog post). He was also looking for some feedback on itâ€¦.
