Good morning.

 

First I would like to introduce myself as the FNG. Hi there.

 

In attempting to solve a problem with a particular relational database, I
realized that the solution was simply to avoid the problem. Long story
short, research led me to Riak, and I'm quite glad that it did. I have a
question regarding Links and Link Traversal. Can Links span buckets? 

 

Is the following possible? If so, are cross-bucket links the best method
for these relationships?

 

/riak/dishes/saucer\_a -- with
; "member\_of"

/riak/dishes/dish\_a -- with
; "member\_of"

/riak/dishes/bowl\_a -- with
; "member\_of"

 

/riak/combos/dish\_set\_a -- with
;
"member\_of"

/riak/combos/place\_setting\_a -- with
; "includes"

 

If the above is both possible and appropriate -- how might one implement a
commit hook that, when a link is added to an item that defines an "includes"
relationship, the "member\_of" relationship is automatically added?
