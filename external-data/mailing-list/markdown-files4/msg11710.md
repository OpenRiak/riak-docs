Thanks to all of you who already filled out the survey. Your responses
have already provided us with lots of useful information.

For anyone who hasn't completed the survey, a heads up that it'll be
closing on 7/26 (this Friday). As mentioned before, all contributors
automatically get Basho swag and discounted RICON tickets. One lucky
contributor will be selected to receive a free ticket to RICON West!
