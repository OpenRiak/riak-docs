&gt; I just have to know.. why is NFS involved?

My company's standard setup is currently based on huge NFS-based SANs
and lots'o'blades. If we can re-use that setup for Riak, things get

(As to the logs, It's mainly the error message and tonnes of these
numbers. I'll post the full log when I get to work tomorrow...)
