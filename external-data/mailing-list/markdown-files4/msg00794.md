Riak Recap for 7/26 - 7/27


1) More from the Riak + JavaScript world... Visionmedia added Riak
support to his "Keys" project, which is a unified interface for
node.js and various key/value stores.

Github repo here ---&gt; http://github.com/visionmedia/keys/commits/master

2) Lateef Jackson updated "Goriak," his Riak client for Google's "Go,"
to work with Riak's REST API. Go check it out... Thanks, Lateef!

Google Code repo here ---&gt; https://code.google.com/p/goriak/

3) Those of you who meticulously monitor the Riak Wiki may have
noticed that we added a few new pages as of late. Here are some
standouts.

We added a page all about Command Line Tools ---&gt;

We also added a section called "Community Processes" which covers code
contributions and wiki contributions. Located here ---&gt;
http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Community+Processes

4) Sean Cribbs and Dan Reverri put together a lengthy and informative
blog post as a follow up to the MapReduce webinar from last week. If
you asked a question but there wasn't time to answer it, it's
mostly-likely covered in this post.

5) Looks like the Fast Track swag is starting to make its way across
the pond. There has been a sighting in France! (h/t to @cstar for
posting this!)

6) Justin Pease (@jpease) put together a great post on his blog about
using Rails 3, Riak, and Ripple.

7) @jebui made it know that Riak is now powering inagist.com.

Tweet here ---&gt; http://twitter.com/jebui/statuses/19731528916

Care to share anymore details on how you're using Riak and what
inagist.com is all about, Jebu?

8) justinsheehy, guestuser, seancribbs, and benchmark had a convo in
#riak that started with " I was wondering how easy it is to shift the
infrastructure from cluster to another cluster if bitcask is the
storage engine with riak."

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/495866

9) There was a brief but worthwhile chat in #riak that started with,
"anyone ever put a reverse proxy in front of riak? "

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/495990

10 ) Q --- Is there a way to put with an undefined key via protobuffs
and have it create a key for you like the rest interface does? (from
@bradfordw via Twitter)

 A --- Not currently, but we plan to implement that soon. Keep
an eye on this if you're interested ---&gt;

11) For anyone in the Bay Area planning to come to the Riak Meetup in
San Francisco on 8/9, we finalized the location and time.

Details are here ---&gt;
