Hi Kelly,

Thank you for the information. I took a look at the client test, but as it 
uses an FSM, the continuous looping gave me a headache :-) Is there a simpler 
test that demos this? If not, can you highlight the lines that make the calls 
to Riak CS etc? That part evades me.

Thanks,
Lee

&gt; We have a fork of erlcloud (https://github.com/basho/erlcloud) we use for 
&gt; testing and it can be made to work with your Riak CS cluster with relatively 
&gt; little pain. Look in the riak\_cs repo under 
&gt; client\_tests/erlang/ercloud\_eqc.erl for some example usage. You'll probably 
&gt; want to set the proxy host and port and perhaps the host name if you're not 
&gt; using the default "s3.amazonaws.com".

&gt;&gt; Hi guys, 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I’m setting up my own Riak CS cluster and wanted to know what the best way 
&gt;&gt; to interact with that cluster would be from an Erlang app? I’ve taken a look 
&gt;&gt; at ErlCloud, but it seems I’d need to butcher it to get it to work with a 
&gt;&gt; custom cluster (not Amazon’s setup). 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
