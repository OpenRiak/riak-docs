No. A fair amount of work went into R16 compatibility, and it was
never ported to the 1.4 branch. A set of patches exists, but I have
no idea if it would apply cleanly. Best to just use a packaged
version of the application, which will come with its own version of
erlang.

&gt; Hello
&gt; I am trying to compile the Riak 1.4.9 sources on openSuSE 13.1 against
&gt; Erlang R16. I know this version of the Erlang VM is not officially
&gt; supported, but I still changed the regex expression in rebar.config, since I
&gt; read it's not a problem.
&gt;
&gt; Now it seems that a crypto class in an Erlang source file is deprecated:
&gt;
&gt; /home/roger/riak/riak-1.4.9/deps/riak\_core/src/chash.erl:105: crypto:sha/1
&gt; is deprecated and will be removed in in a future release; use crypto:hash/2
&gt; ERROR: compile failed while processing
&gt; /home/roger/riak/riak-1.4.9/deps/riak\_core: rebar\_abort
&gt; make: \*\*\* [compile] Error 1
&gt;
&gt; Is there any chance to get around this?
