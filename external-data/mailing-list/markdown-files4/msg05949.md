Let me pose the question a different way. What is a good way to pull out
objects across multiple buckets based upon some secondary data that is not
their key?

The items in the buckets all have unique keys. Maybe move them all into a
single bucket (millions of items) and then I could use secondary indexes to
pull the find them?

If the keys of my objects are unique does organizing them into buckets
really gain me anything over just putting them all in a single bucket and
using secondary indexes to find them?

&gt; Something similar to how you can feed a map query with bucket/key pairs,
&gt; I'm looking to run an index query with bucket/index pairs.
