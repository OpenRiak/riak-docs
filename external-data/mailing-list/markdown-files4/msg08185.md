&gt; I am new to Riak and its concepts and just trying to see whether it can fit
&gt; into my domain of applications. I am working on core Java server software
&gt; systems (no enterprise, no heavy sql) and I am very used to having control
&gt; on all of data in memory with strict semantics.
&gt;
&gt; So for one of the cases I am evaluating Riak, I need to make sure that when
&gt; a transaction (or request) is executed and finished, db value it resulted
&gt; also has been persisted at its final form which does not have any conflicts
&gt; waiting to be resolved by other processes. Result of the transaction is sent
&gt; back to the client and it's unacceptable for this result to be invalidated
&gt; by another process which overwrites this result in db due to conflict
&gt; resolution routine.
&gt;
&gt; The question is whether a read-write-read sequence is acceptable or applied
&gt; pattern for such cases or are there any other solutions to this problem? Or
&gt; am I just expecting too much?

I don't think riak has any transaction-like concepts or any way to
give one writer precedence over another in the case of concurrent
updates.
