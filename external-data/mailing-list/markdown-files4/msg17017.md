Hey Colin,

Riak Search definitely indexes json documents. My guess is that your 
json-object keys are not indexed via the schema?

We have an example in the docs page (w/ the Java client as well): 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/search/#Indexing-Values 
 (& 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/search-schema/#Creating-a-Custom-Schema
 

 may be helpful too).

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the basic question but I couldn't find the answer in the 
&gt; documentation. Does Riak search currently index documents sent as JSON? It 
&gt; doesn't look like it from the basic tests that I've run. I am using the new 
&gt; Solr search on Riak 2.1.3.
&gt; 
&gt; When I send data to the bucket using a Map type in the java client everything 
&gt; is indexed and I can search for my data as expected. However, when I send the 
&gt; same Java map as JSON I cannot find a way to search within it. I am using the 
&gt; default index schema.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks everyone!
