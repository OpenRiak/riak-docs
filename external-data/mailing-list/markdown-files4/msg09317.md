Hi Venki,

I know this email is about two months late, but I figured it was worth
responding to as I've had this response as a draft for the last 60 or
days or so. :)

At any rate, it \*looks\* like you are (or were) hitting this:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/issues/290

It has been patched and will be fixed in the 1.3 release of Riak which
is slated for release towards the middle of January (if all goes to
plan).

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I am getting the following error code from Riak when I execute my map
&gt; reduce..
&gt;
&gt; {"phase":0,"error":"[timeout]","input":"{&lt;&lt;\"20120708\"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;\"JM\"&gt;&gt;}","type":"forward\_preflist","stack":"[]"}
&gt;
&gt; This was happening from the past two days when my [bucket,key] count
&gt; went huge upto 40k...
&gt;
&gt; I tried changing the q\_limit value from 64 to 2000, but still no affect
&gt; so far..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Please help on the above..
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Venkatesh
