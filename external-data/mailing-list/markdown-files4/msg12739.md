&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a Riak cluster with 5 nodes on AWS m1.large instances, all using EBS 
&gt; deadline scheduling. The cluster is accessed via node.js and the riak-js 
&gt; library using the HTTP protocol. Iâ€™ve tried it with and without connection 
&gt; pooling. All software has been updated to the latest versions.
&gt; 
&gt; Occasionally, riak seems to not store an object I try to save. I have run 
&gt; tcpdump on the node receiving the request to ensure it is receiving the http 
&gt; packets with the correct JSON from the client. When the issue occurs the node 
&gt; is in fact receiving the request with the correct JSON.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else experienced an issue like this? Any hints on how to debug the 
&gt; situation would be greatly appreciated.

What are your read and write quorums, and does the write report that it
suceeded?

Andrew
