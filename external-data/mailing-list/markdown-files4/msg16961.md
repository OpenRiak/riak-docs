Given the tunables that Riak has, I would say that its reliability in
terms of consistency (as in ACID) are unparalleled. It offers a
variety of weak consistency options from eventual consistency, to
strong eventual consistency, to strong consistency\*.

In terms of fault-tolerance, it is interesting. Riak hides faults in
funny ways where other databases would degrade. It instead does a
really good job of hiding faults. This can be problematic, because
often the signal for a database degrading can be "the website is
flakey".

\* This is "experimental"

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am a member of the community for about a year to understand reliability of
&gt; Riak.
&gt;
&gt; What I can see here is that there are some problems which could prevent
&gt; using
&gt;
&gt; it in a project which require high reliability. That's why I'd like to ask
&gt; the following:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Do you believe that Riak can be used in a project which requires high
&gt; reliability?
&gt;
&gt; Yes!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thank you so much..
&gt;
&gt;
