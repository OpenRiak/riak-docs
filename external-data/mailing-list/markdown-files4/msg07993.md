Right, the problem goes way beyond just the client-side libraries.
Relational databases can do "pagination" easily because of the ORDER BY,
LIMIT and OFFSET query modifiers. Reid Draper has previously shared a plan
for limited/resumed 2I queries in Riak, but that feature won't be in Riak
1.2, nor will it likely include reversed ordering (DESC) when it does land.
