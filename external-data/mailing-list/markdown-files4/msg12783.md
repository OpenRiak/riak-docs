Also, if you are using a one node cluster, I also change target\_n\_val to 1. 
This stops riak-admin diag from complaining that I don't have a enough nodes, 
and I figure could give a speed up. My single node development setups have 
the following in their app.config files, in the riak\_core section:

{target\_n\_val, 1},
{default\_bucket\_props, [
 {n\_val,1}
]},

This sets the default bucket properties to have n\_val at 1 as well as setting 
target\_n\_val to 1 (which must be a power of 2, and no less then your biggest 
n\_val).
