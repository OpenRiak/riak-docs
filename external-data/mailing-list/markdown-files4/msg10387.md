The eleveldb app.config are the default. I don't know enough to modify them.
What are the defaults?

Your eleveldb app.config settings are decidedly non-default. Is there any
reason for that? Also, you spelled "cache\_size" incorrectly in your eleveldb
config setting. What happens when you set those back to defaults? Is there a
reason that you're changing these settings?

 

This looks eerily similar to an unanswered Stack Overflow question [1] and
marginally similar to this mailing list thread about bad disks [2]. Since
it's after hours Pacific time, I'd wait for tomorrow and hope that some of
the folks living in "the future" have an idea.

I don't see any errors there.

 

There is an empty crash.log that was dated with a timestamp recently.

Your Riak search hook crashed. There is a bad argument being sent to Erlang.
Check your Riak logs for more detail.

I don't know how to interpret this error. Any help would be appreciated.

 

Thank you.
