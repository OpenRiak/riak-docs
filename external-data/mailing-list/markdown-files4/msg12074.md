Hi Everyone,

I was wonder firstly if you could run Riak for application data and Riak CS on 
the same production cluster or would you need two independent clusters? 
Also could you use Riak CS for your application data?

I think that I would need to run Riak and Riak CS on independent clusters and 
that I can't use Riak CS for my application data. Just looking for 
clarification.

Cheers,

James
