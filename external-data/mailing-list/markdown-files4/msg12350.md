Hi Matt,

For my own project, I needed a way to fetch the set of items that needed 
updating. I just stored a unix timestamp (as an integer) when there were to 
be updated, and then do a 2i range query from the oldest time possible to the 
current time. It works like a charm for me.

I don't have this project working at scale right now, so in terms of speed I'm 
not sure. Though I'd think doing range queries against the ISO8601 would be 
more difficult.
