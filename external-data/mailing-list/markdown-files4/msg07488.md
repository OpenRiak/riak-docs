I'm running a newly installed 1.1.2 release of riak (evaluating it for use)
and I'm getting the prelist\_exhausted error on my first map reduce attempt.
Searching the list gave me some clues so I found the "VMs are all busy"
error in the console log and I see the following when I execute this rpc
call on one of the nodes:

rpc:multicall(riak\_kv\_js\_manager,pool\_size,[riak\_kv\_js\_map]).
{"\b\b\b\b\b",[]}

I don't see any other log or error messages so I don't determine why the JS
VMs are not starting properly. Has anyone seen and/or resolved this on
1.1.2?

Regards
