&gt; Hi Sergey,

&gt; We (OpenX) have a riak\_core based application that's running on a 125 node 
&gt; cluster (there are also other smaller clusters). We never really tested to 
&gt; see where it would fall over (and the cluster was much smaller when it 
&gt; started), but I see no indicators that it will fall over when we add the 
&gt; 126th node. FWIW, it's running riak\_core 0.13.0, and I assume the newer 
&gt; versions of riak\_core have only gotten better. Answers to some of your other 
&gt; questions (based solely on my experience) in-line below.

The riak list mentioned optimism about riak clusters of 200+ nodes in a thread 
here:
http://riak-users.197444.n3.nabble.com/does-Riak-cluster-maintain-fully-connected-Erlang-network-td3695942.html

However, as mentioned in the thread, a fully connected network of nodes (fully 
connected because of the usage of distributed Erlang) does have a natural 
limit (due to the network speed) on scalability with the net tick time. You 
can always increase the net tick time, but then failures will take longer to 
detect.

So, your success may rely on your fault-tolerance requirements.
