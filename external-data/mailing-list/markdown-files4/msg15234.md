That was it, thanks!  I didn't add strong consistency = on to my riak.conf.

I am starting to test consistent buckets but can't get them to work.  I built a 
new VM with Ubuntu 14.04 64bit, server, installed Riak using the 
packagecloud.io script, and am trying to run:
riak attachriak\_ensemble\_manager:enable().
I get the following back:
\*\* exception exit: {noproc,{gen\_server,call,                                    
   [riak\_ensemble\_manager,enable,infinity]}}     in function  gen\_server:call/3 
(gen\_server.erl, line 188)
What am I missing?  I think I have the wrong version of something installed, 
but I can't figure out what.

You're trying to make calls into subsystems that aren't running. Follow the 
docs for enabling strong consistency instead:
