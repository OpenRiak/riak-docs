Does the bitcask back end handle crash recovery as well as the
InnoStore backend?

&gt; -------------------------
&gt; Riak 0.11.0 Release Notes
&gt; -------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Bitcask has arrived as the new default backend for Riak.  Bitcask is Basho's
&gt; new key/value store that should provide good balanced performance out
&gt; of the box on most systems.  Read more about it from the initial
&gt; announcement here http://blog.basho.com/2010/04/27/hello,-bitcask/
&gt;
&gt; Users that wish to upgrade from another backend will need to backup their
&gt; cluster (using riak-admin) before changing the backend in app.config,
&gt; restart
&gt; riak and restore from the backup into bitcask.
&gt;
&gt; The protocol buffers client (PBC) interface has been enhanced to
&gt; add map/reduce support and access to simple bucket properties.  The
&gt; erlang and python clients have been updated accordingly.
&gt;
&gt; Put operations using the local erlang client that request a returnbody
&gt; have received a performance enhancement.  Internally the put operation
&gt; now returns the body directly, so an additional get is no longer
&gt; required.  The PBC and HTTP interfaces have been updated to use
&gt; this new mechanism.
&gt;
&gt; Enhancements
&gt; --------
&gt;  58 - provide default content-type of application/octet-stream if none
&gt;        present in the object.
&gt;  74 - create ring directory if non-existant
&gt; 142 - riak-admin leave restored
&gt;
&gt; Bugs Fixed
&gt; ----------
&gt;  35 - {error, blah} messages are now passed on to javascript map/reduce jobs
&gt; 104 - missing bucket/key into map/reduce job crashed it. Fixed.
&gt; 193 - list keys sometimes uses downed nodes. Fixed.
&gt; 208 - deleting a key with a post-commit hook set crashed riak. Fixed.
