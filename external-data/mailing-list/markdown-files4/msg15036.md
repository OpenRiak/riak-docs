Hi Anthony,

When you put files, are you also including any ACL information?

&gt; Does anyone have an idea why this is working this way or if it is

&gt;
&gt; We are running Riak-CS on version 1.4.8.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the situation. We have a bucket that is owned by Acct1 that has
&gt; folders in it. Acct2 has been granted all permissions to the bucket and all
&gt; sub-folders.
&gt;
&gt; Acct2 puts a file in one of the subfolders, but Acct1 has no permissions at
&gt; all for the file.
&gt;
&gt; Acct1 puts a file in the same folder and Acct2 automatically has all of the
&gt; same permissions to the file as it has to the parent folder.
&gt;
&gt; Why is it working this way and how do I get it to inherit permissions
&gt; automatically?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Anthony
