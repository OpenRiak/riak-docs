Hi,

I have just read the benchmark for Riak against several other NoSQL
databases here:
http://www.slideshare.net/ThibaultDory/comparing-nosql-databases-benchmark

It seems that the performance is not as good. Is this justifiable?

I am keen to hear what others say about Riak's read performance
especially in production.
