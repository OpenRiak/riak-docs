Hi,

Like to ask how to do the following in map-reduce:
1. Searching by field
2. Sorting by field

I know that using the solr interface you can do the both. But the is an
behavior that i have solr is making for me.
the start and rows are not based on the result set but more on based which
is added to the bucket first (not sure if this is also happening to others).

Thanks,

Odie
