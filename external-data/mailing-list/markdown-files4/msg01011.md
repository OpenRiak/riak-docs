Afternoon, Evening, Morning to all,

I love writing Recaps like this. Here's why: Blog posts, new wiki
pages, great stuff from #riak, slide decks, and much more.

Have a great weekend!

Riak Recap for 9/1 - 9/2

1) @thecolonial put together an extensive post that covers getting a
Riak-backed dev environment up and running. This is a great post and
should especially tug at the heart strings of you hardcore Erlangers.

Post here ---&gt; http://buffered.io/2010/09/01/webmachine-erlydtl-and-riak-part-1/

Thanks for the write up, OJ!

2) @siculars posted on using Riak's map/reduce for sorting. This is
great post with extensive code examples.

Check it out here ---&gt; http://post.ly/v4UE

3) @roidrage presented on Riak at yesterday's RUG meetup in Berlin. He
also posted his slides shortly after. These are excellent.

Check them out here ---&gt; http://riak-rugb.heroku.com/#1

He also posted a blog entitled, "Why I Love and Hate Distributed
Systems." It's good. Read it here ---&gt;

4) We posted a quick blurb on the Basho Blog about adding a new
Community Editor

Read it here ---&gt;

5) On a related note, I threw together a "Riak Community" Section for the wiki.

Check it out here ---&gt; https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/The+Riak+Community

Admiteddly, this section is a bit sparse, but it's only a short term
solution until we get a new Basho site launched (which is slated to
happen in the not so distant future). In the mean time, if anyone has
any ideas for the this part of the wiki, we would love to hear them.

6) Basically all that went down in #riak from Wednesday, September 1st
is worth reading, so to save myself some copy and pasting and your
some clicking, I'm simply going to point you at all of it. ---&gt;

7) nfo and hemulen had a quick chat about some map reduce specifics.

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/564449

8) Q --- Is there a reason why the default n value for riak is 3?
(via mheld from #riak)

 A --- It's a sensible default - Lamport says you need at least 3
computers for fault-tolerance. It's also because 3 is the lowest
value at which quorum and all are not the same .

9) benblack, seancribbs and drewr had a discussion in #riak that
started with, "This is probably a faq, but why do R, W, and DW need to
be less than n\_val?"

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/564464

10) So check this out:

At 17:40 yesterday, solidsnack asked, "Does Riak support HTTPS?"

At 22:28, benblack made it work ---&gt;
