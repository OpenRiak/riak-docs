&gt; HI Chris
&gt; I cant send the code publicly so I tested with couple more examples.If I 
&gt; annotate the field with "secretKey" or "authSecret", then those field values 
&gt; are becoming null in the object.
&gt; 
&gt; If I change the key with "indexKey" or some thing then it's part of the 
&gt; object state. I have modified accordingly. Is there any restrictions on the 
&gt; naming of the 2i index?

Hi Santi,

Can you make a smaller example to reproduce the issue from scratch that you can 
share?

That will assist in debugging the issue.

Thanks,
