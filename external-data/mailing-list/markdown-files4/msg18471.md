Hi Andrew, all,IIRC, we have mentioned an important step to bootstrap
the community is to identify baselines.Can anyone confirm that
contributions should be based on NHS branch (which one ?) ? In
particular, I'm interested in contributing to OTP19/20 upgrade.
Furthermore, I've mentioned OW2 organization would be glad to provide
the community with infrastructure: gitlab, CI (tools + servers),
etc.Are you interested in it ? Just let me know if it is the case or
have a look at the project submission page: https://projects.ow2.org/bi
n/view/wiki/submission#
Best regards,Jean
