I m having a weird issue. I have installed Riak with 3 clusters as shown in the 
"how to get started". Things were working fine until last night.After a hard 
reboot, when I run the riak server ( all three of them dev1 , dev2 and dev 3) 
and try to store in riak, I get the response as 

HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable [Vary: Accept-Encoding, Server: MochiWeb/1.1 
WebMachine/1.9.0 (participate in the frantic), Date: Fri, 09 Dec 2011 19:52:26 
GMT, Content-Type: text/plain, Content-Length: 18] 

I am able to read form the earlier stored buckets. but cannot store to any of 
them. as suggested in the document. How to get this work again?  I can start 
another instance, but I just want to know if this is a common case, where i 
need to weak some parameter.

Thanks
