I got some helpful feedbacks from Jon Meredith about the errors encountered
during my previous runs:

I don't have a Windows environment available to replicate your work with,
but it looks a bit like the R script is being interpreted as a shell script
rather than as Rscript

You may have soem more mileage running Rscript directly.
 /path/to/Rscript priv/summary.r -i tests/current

The inputs from Jon are very helpful and now I am able to run the command to
generate benchmark graphs, such as the following example output below.
Thanks for the good info from Jon.
