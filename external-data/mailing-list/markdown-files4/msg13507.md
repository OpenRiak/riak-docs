I have just removed a node from our Riak cluster, and I just turned up the
transfer limit on the removing node high, and set the other machines in the
cluster to 1. That way the node going out of the cluster got rid of its
data as fast as possible, while the nodes serving clients only had 1
transfer each to make sure they weren't overloaded. It worked fine for me,
but it might depend on how much load you have on the cluster during the
data migration and how important response times are for your system.
