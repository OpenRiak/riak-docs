Hi Pete,

Thank you for sharing your setup.

Is the issue resolved when using a Windows host if you comment out or
disable the following two lines?

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Thanks for getting back to me.
&gt;
&gt; As for sharing the setup - I have cut the files down to the minimum needed to 
&gt; show the problem and popped them onto github,
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/psl-trifork/riak-docker
&gt;
&gt; The actual project is a lot more complicated but this one riak docker image 
&gt; is proving to be a pain when run on Windows and only Windows. Linux and MacOS 
&gt; are fine.
&gt;
&gt; If you can spot any obvious gotchas then please do let me know.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance.
