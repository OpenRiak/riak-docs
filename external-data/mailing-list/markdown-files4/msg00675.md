Hi all,

While going through the fast track, I noticed the following output
when stopping my local nodes via "dev?/bin/riak stop":

ps: illegal option -- f
usage: ps [-AaCcEefhjlMmrSTvwXx] [-O fmt | -o fmt] [-G gid[,gid...]]
 [-u]
 [-p pid[,pid...]] [-t tty[,tty...]] [-U user[,user...]]
 ps [-L]
ok

It seems that ps -f is not supported (indeed illegal!) on OS X. The
following change works for me and I believe will work just as well on
Linux.

 Fix ps command in riak stop for OS X

 OS X's ps command does not support -f, might as well
 pull out just the fields needed using -o

I've also attempted to attach the patch in case whitespace is
destroyed via email.
