&gt; As to a few specifics surrounding what was mentioned above (I'm running Riak
&gt; on RHEL 6 on dedicated Rackspace gear):
&gt; 
&gt; - RAID 10 if you've got the money for the drives and can work within the
&gt; space constraints. Otherwise, RAID 5.
&gt; - deadline i/o scheduler
&gt; - vm.swappiness = 0
&gt; - pay careful attention to the memory tuning of leveldb caches (if you're
&gt; using level) based on your fault tolerance requirements, available ram,
&gt; number of nodes (check the docs, the recommended formula is in there)
&gt; - give a lot of thought to your ring size. Too large with too few physical
&gt; nodes and you'll run into performance issues, to small and you'll not be
&gt; able to expand. Again, read through all the docs.
