&gt; Hey Riak Users,
&gt;
&gt; We've just pushed a release candidate of the official Python client to
&gt; PyPi [1]. This package includes support for Riak 2.0.0 RC1 features,
&gt; including security, data types, Search 2.0 (Yokozuna), and bucket
&gt; types. Documentation on the new APIs is incomplete [2], but you can
&gt; refer to the official Riak documentation [3] for overviews and
&gt; tutorials with Python-specific examples. We will be polishing the API
&gt; documentation for the final release.
&gt;
&gt; Please note that this release adds a new dependency on pyOpenSSL [4],
&gt; which supports a wider range of TLS options than the standard library
&gt; ssl package. This is only used if you enable Riak 2.0's new security
&gt; features, but will be installed regardless when you install the
&gt; client. You may receive a warning when importing the client code if
&gt; your version of OpenSSL is too old or doesn't expose TLS v1.2.
&gt;
&gt; Significant changes that are not related to new Riak features:
&gt;
&gt; - Previously-marked deprecated methods/features have been removed. [5]
&gt; - PB is now the default protocol for new clients. [6] HTTP is still
&gt; available, but this is part of our larger effort to phase out HTTP
&gt; in our official libraries.
&gt;
&gt; There are some significant known-issues with this package that you
&gt; should be aware of:
&gt;
&gt; - Strongly-consistent keys will work (the API is similar enough to
&gt; regular K/V), but if a CAS update operation fails, your application
&gt; code will have to perform the retry. This will be wrapped in an API
&gt; for the final release.
&gt; - We have had multiple reports of connections leaking while iterating
&gt; over streamed responses [7], these will be resolved by final
&gt; release.
&gt; - Although the behavior hasn't changed, we will be attempting to
&gt; address a number of Unicode issues before final release [8].
&gt;
&gt; For all other known issues, please refer to the issue tracker on
&gt; Github [9]. Milestones in the tracker refer to \*Riak\* releases
&gt; although the client version is different. We encourage you to report
&gt; any issues you find with the release candidate client.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers!
