Hey all,

Question about EC2 (or scale in general): i'm building a decent cluster, to 
handle 15-20k inserts/s and 5-10k gets per second. (for a rough idea of what 
I'm doing). I've been playing with a 15-node cluster of m2.xlarge systems, but 
I am wondering what is better: more small systems or less larger systems? 

Any recommendations/hints/tricks would be a huge help!

Eric
