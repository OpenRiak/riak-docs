HI all,

In production, we are experiencing "Socket returned short packet length 0 -
expected 4" exceptions whenever we try to store an object &gt;20K in size. In
addition, the exception typically takes over 60 seconds to manifest. The
content of each object is an bytearray.

Any idea what could be causing this exception?

Other details:
Library: Python
Version: riak==2.0.1, riak-pb==1.4.1.1
Protocol: pbc
Steps to reproduce: N/A. This only happens in production, not on dev
machines.

Thanks in advance,

Jason
