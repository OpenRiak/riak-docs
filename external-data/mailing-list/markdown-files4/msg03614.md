Hi,

 I had a pretty minor pull request against riak\_kv

https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/105

which I sent a few weeks ago, however, I've not seen any comments
or anything. So I wanted to understand a little better what the 
process for this sort of thing should be. Is a github pull request
the preferred mode of communication, or should we also send emails
or open bugs in the bugtracker?

Maybe the process is spelled out somewhere and I'm just missing it?
Or maybe the process is just to submit a pull request and wait and
I'm impatient ;)

Thanks for the info,

-Anthony
