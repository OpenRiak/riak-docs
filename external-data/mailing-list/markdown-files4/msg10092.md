Evening, Morning, Afternoon to All -

Long overdue Recap coming your way. Code, blogs, meetups, and more.

Heres another reminder about RICON | EAST happening this May in New
York City. I would love to see all of you there. Also, Basho is paying
travel and hotel expenses for all speakers, so I expect everyone to
submit a CFP about their Riak clusters.

\* Details here ---&gt; ricon.io/east.html

Enjoy, and thanks for being a part of Riak.
