For sanity, I just moved the Erlang crash dump into it's own Gist :

&gt; Hi there
&gt;
&gt; Trying to get a simple Riak Cluster configured on some VMs. I'm using
&gt; Ubuntu 12.04 and compiled Riak 1.4 from source. It will start up fine
&gt; when bound to 127.0.0.1 but after changing the IP in app.config and
&gt; vm.args it no longer starts.
&gt;
&gt; The only output I get from Riak start is:
&gt;
&gt; Node 'riak@192.168.123.10' not responding to pings.
&gt;
&gt; I bet more (obviously) from riak console, this is in the Gist linked below.
&gt;
&gt; All the relevant config files, console outputs and log files are here:

&gt;
&gt; Any help would be much appreciated!
