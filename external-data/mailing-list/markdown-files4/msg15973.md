Not sure off the top of my head. Just look for something that does that via 
Amazon S3... cause that's how you talk to RiakCS.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for the link Chris. I did see that project earlier but didn't 
&gt;&gt; &gt; notice it was developed by a Basho engineer :-) will have a look in detail.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It was developed for a blog post and conference talk in 2012, so YMMV.
