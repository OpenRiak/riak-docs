Another possibility that comes to mind to avoid the setup cost is to
do connection pool
of some sorts.

Does any of the riak client lib supports connection pooling?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, the majority of the cost is probably in TCP setup. That pain is 
&gt;&gt;&gt; happening at the TCP stack level, not in Erlang.  It's actually really

&gt;&gt;&gt; have "standby workers", especially when they don't need to maintain state 
&gt;&gt;&gt; between requests.
