Toby, thank you for reporting. However, I could not figure out which
part of the doc is wrong and leading to Stanchion 1.5. Could you
elaborate more details?

Technically, it is correct to use Stanchion 2.0 with Riak CS 2.0.1.
And more, difference between Stanchion 2.0 and 1.5 is very small, it's
just about configuration file format, and several items.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I think this is a bug?
&gt;
&gt; Riak CS 2.0.1 recommends Stanchion 2.0.0 to be installed.
&gt;
&gt; However if you follow the instructions to add the Riak CS repo, you get Riak
&gt; CS 2.0.1, and Stanchion 1.5.0.
