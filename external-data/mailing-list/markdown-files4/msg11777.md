Hi Folks,

We're looking to migrate our systems to a new database and we really like what 
Riak provides. But we have one question lingering. We need to store and query a 
lot of floating point data. How well does Riak perform with searching for data 
that falls within a range? For example, if i wanted to search for geographical 
data within a range of latitudes and longitudes. I can't find much 
documentation on that topic. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

V/R
