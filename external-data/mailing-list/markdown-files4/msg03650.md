&gt; Hi all, but mainly directed at Sean Cribbs ...
&gt; 
&gt; From the slides at 
&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/seancribbs/introducing-riak-and-ripple , slide 
&gt; number 143 in particular, it seems that Ripple already supports indexes, 
&gt; because that item is highlighted on the slide. However, I can't see any 
&gt; mention of it in the documentation, mainly, the list of modules and methods.
&gt; 
&gt; Since Ripple currently doesn't support using a property as a key, I am 
&gt; searching for a way to efficiently work around that. I'm sure this has been 
&gt; dealt with by somebody already.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
