It has to do with Solr's commit frequency:

&gt;&gt; Hi Santi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There is a one-second delay (on average) between storing an object in
&gt;&gt; Riak and having it available in a Search query.

&gt;&gt; &gt; HI I'm having some consistency issues with Riak Search.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have configured Riak Search and enabled search for a specific bucket.
&gt;&gt; &gt; In
&gt;&gt; &gt; one of the service layer methods, I"m storing the object into the Riak
&gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; doing some more updates and immediately trying to search on a attribute
&gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; the object. It's intended to return the same object which I stored, but
&gt;&gt; &gt; RiakSearch in not returning object.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; If I run in the debug mode, and give some time, then search is able to
&gt;&gt; &gt; return the object.
