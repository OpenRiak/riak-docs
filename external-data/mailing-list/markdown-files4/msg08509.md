Hi Matt,

We verify rolling upgrades from two releases back. You are safe to proceed in 
the rolling upgrade from 1.1 to 1.2.

&gt; Hey list,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to be doing our first full-cluster upgrade in production soon. The 
&gt; docs suggest this is as easy as stopping a node, upgrading, and restarting 
&gt; the node - doing each node one at a time. Before I start, It'd be great if 
&gt; someone could confirm that I have this right.. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
