Thanks Shane ,

Load script used is as follows (basically a curl)

#!/usr/local/bin/escript
main([Filename]) -&gt;
 {ok, Data} = file:read\_file(Filename),
 Lines = tl(re:split(Data, "\r?\n", [{return, binary},trim])),
 lists:foreach(fun(L) -&gt; LS = re:split(L, ","), format\_and\_insert(LS) end, 
Lines).

format\_and\_insert(Line) -&gt;
 JSON = 
io\_lib:format("{\"id\":\"~s\",\"phonenumber\":~s,\"callednumber\":~s,\"starttime\":~s,\"endtime\":~s,\"status\":~s}",
 Line),
 Command = io\_lib:format("curl -X PUT 
http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/CustCalls35m/~s -d '~s' -H 'content-type: 
application/json'", [hd(Line),JSON]),
 io:format("Inserting: ~s~n", [hd(Line)]),
 os:cmd(Command).


&gt;&gt; you are right shane .after Loading it I confirm the same by querying the 
&gt;&gt; (1.8GB)35 million dataset with first ,middle and last row 
&gt;&gt; value(1,15000000,35000000) with id column.hence confirmed its stored onto 
&gt;&gt; CustCalls35m bucket of riak db.

Regards
Sangeetha

&gt; Dear Team ,
&gt;
&gt; I have a 64 GB RAM ,during the Load of 35 million
&gt; dataset (1.8 GB) it consumes nearly 40-45 GB of RAM durial the startup
&gt; of the erlang script ,but
&gt;
&gt; While trying to load 40 million dataset (2.1 GB) I am getting the
&gt; following error
&gt;
&gt; \*escript: exception error: no match of right hand side value
&gt; {error,enomem}\*\*,\*

The error message is coming from escript and not Riak. It's just a guess but 
could it be that the script you're using to load your data into Riak is trying 
to load all the data into memory before sending it to Riak?
Can you break your dataset into smaller chunks and load them separately?
Or send the data to Riak as you read it from the dataset without storing it all 
in memory?

&gt; \*2.\*\*Is there a provision to make use of the swap memory in riak
&gt; config?\*

Using swap in this situation is almost always a bad idea. Your script will end 
up running so slowly you will be waiting for days, maybe months, for your data 
to load.

Shane.
