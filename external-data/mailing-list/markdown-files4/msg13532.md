Greetings all. We are working on our product with embedded Riak. One
question that came up is what does Riak do when/if we start seeing this in
the logs:

system\_memory\_high\_watermark

Is this just informational, or does Riak act on this alarm in some way to
try to reduce its own memory use?

Thanks!

-Matt
