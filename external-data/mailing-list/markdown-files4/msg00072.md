Good catch, Dan. I've been running with the dets backend on my 
laptop for a while now since an SSD forgives a lot.

For innostore I believe there is a maximum key size of 255 bytes.

Via the Erlang client, 'cause that's what I had handy, I did a put/

with no issues. You might run into URL length issues, depending on 
the client libs used, and/or the HTTP interface might have issues 
with URLs that long but I think the underpinnings should work with 
long keys just fine. Obviously, you're creating additional overhead 
with large keys -- replicas and such -- but it should Just Work 
otherwise.

Hi,

What is or is there a maximum key length in Riak? Either natively 
or in the HTTP interface?


My use case is keeping inheritance in it's own key so for example, 
I have two keys, "A" and "B" and I want to keep a third key "A,B". 
You see that the key length is a function of member key size times 
number of members. Knowing length would give me an aproximation of 
depth.


Thank you,
Alexander
