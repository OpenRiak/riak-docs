Deploying 3 instances of Riak on one node is going to be a pain, since
you'll have to rename nodes and use different ports.

Go for 3 separate instances if they satisfy your performance needs.

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt;
&gt; Have a question about deployment, hope you can help.
&gt;
&gt; I am working on a start up project, which means very little money to start
&gt; with and no guarantee whether it is going to gain traction.
&gt;
&gt; Using riak as I like the scalability and the API.
&gt;
&gt; It is not a mission critical app, and writes are not too frequent, so data
&gt; consistency is not of utmost importance in the early stage.
&gt;
&gt; Which of the below deployment make sense, considering budget constraints..
&gt;
&gt; a) Deploy 3 nodes into a single EC2 Large (for faster IO)
&gt; b) Deploy a node in each of 3 Small/Medium EC2 nodes.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the help.
&gt; Jimmy
