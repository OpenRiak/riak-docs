Hi all,
Greeting for this day.

I have successfully inserted data into the riak database using riak-python
client and currently, I'm using single node configuration. I'm refering to
http://riak-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/2.2.0/client.html this website
for a tutorial but I'm having lots of problem in getting the clear solution.

my system configuration is:
OS - Ubuntu Trusty LTS
Python - 2.7.6
Riak KV - 2.1.4

So my question is that now:

Q) I want to see what are all the buckets that are present in my database
at this moment?
Q) If I know the name of the buckets then is there any way to retrieve all
the keys that bucket have?
Q) Is there any possibility by which we can specify the \*WHERE \*condition
as we do in SQL?

Please help me in this.
Any documentation or website or any kind of help is apprecited.
