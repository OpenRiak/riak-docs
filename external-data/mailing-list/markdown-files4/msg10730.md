&gt; Tom,
&gt;
&gt; You can do it like this (assuming -setcookie riak is in your vm.args):
&gt;
&gt; erl -remsh riak@ -setcookie riak
&gt;
&gt; That will give you an Erlang shell connected to the remote node, but
&gt; do note that a few things are different:
&gt;
&gt; 1) You should use "Ctrl-G q" to quit the console.
&gt; 2) You will not receive log messages from lager in the console.
&gt; 3) If the network becomes bogged down, from load or connectivity
&gt; issues, you might have decreased responsiveness from the shell.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am wondering how to connect to a remote Riak cluster with riak
&gt; console, or
&gt; &gt; if it's possible. I was hoping there's --host option but that didn't
&gt; work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Tom
