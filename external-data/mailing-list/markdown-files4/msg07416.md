Hi Wu,

Barring any major issues, we intend for the next Riak release to be on
R15B01. For now you can do as you have, just changing the version string in
the rebar.config files.

&gt; Hi, guys,

&gt; It's about half an year past after the R15B has been released, after all.
&gt;
&gt; I just change the rebar.config in
&gt; riak/riak\_kv/riak\_search/cluster\_info, It looks riak work well on
&gt; erlang/OTP R15B01. but I guess you guys must have reason not to
&gt; support R15B now, I just wander about it.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards.
