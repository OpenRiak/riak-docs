Hi,
I think I've spotted an issue with the configuration snippets given on 
both these pages, relating to configuring Riak CS.. but it might just be 
my misunderstanding of Erlang configuration formats.


http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Building-a-Local-Test-Environment/

http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/configuration/Configuring-Riak/

On those pages, none of the names of backends are quoted.
ie. We have {be\_blocks, riak\_kv\_bitcask\_backend,
rather than:
{&lt;&lt;"be\_blocks""&gt;, riak\_kv\_bitcask\_backend,

However in the regular Riak configuration section, backend names are 
always quoted.


Now, I note that if you use the entire configuration snippet verbatim, 
that it all works. However if you want to set more backends and to 
select them via REST bucket properties, then you find that none of the 
backends can be found.


Things only seemed to work as expected once I went through and quoted 
all the backend names - in the multi\_backend{} part, and also for the 
prefix\_list and default options.



I'm not going to submit any pull requests for this, since I'm not sure 
if this is even an issue or not, but I thought I'd mention it.
