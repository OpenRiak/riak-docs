Brian and riak-users,

Thanks to your message and many months of requests for the same thing,
weâ€™ve decided to open up our prototype C/C++ client[1]. Please be warned
that this client library is incomplete and is not officially supported for
production use. That said, we will do our best to review bugs and
pull-requests in a timely manner.

As with all of our open-source software, it is licensed under the Apache
2.0 license and available on Github. We encourage everyone who is
interested to contribute.
