Nice!

I had actually done the same thing using DrSlump's protobuf library and
found that it worked quite well and was about 40% faster than HTTP.

I'm curious what your results might be performance-wise comparing what you
have written to DrSlumps (I noticed there is a commit comment about
comparing to DrSlumps).

&gt; Subject: php 5.3 protocol buffer client
&gt;
&gt; Past few days I have been experimenting with a protocol buffers client for
&gt; riak in php 5.3.
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/gaiaops/riak-php-client
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-php-client/pull/20
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It is a port of the existing php client and should be backward compatible
&gt; with the existing code. Everything seems to work as expected and passes the
&gt; unit tests.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone willing to play with it in their test environments to help me find
&gt; bugs? Also, interested in getting help finishing it, as maintaining the
&gt; code is a lot of work.
&gt;
