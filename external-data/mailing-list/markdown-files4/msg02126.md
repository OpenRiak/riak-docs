Hi guys, I haven't been able to find any documentation about the matter, if you 
have some references I would really appreciate to be redirected.
My understanding is that an embedded document is useful only when the document 
has to be accessible only bt the "root" object, so for example if I need to 
validate uniqueness on an embedded document I can't do it globally but only in 
the scope of the father. Is this correct ?

TIA,
 ngw

p.s. I can't find how to validate uniqueness in Ripple, the only validation I 
found is present =&gt; true. Pointers ?
