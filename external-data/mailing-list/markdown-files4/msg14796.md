Hi Kevin,

The top of the document you reference has this disclaimer:

"This document refers to the now deprecated Riak Search."

Please use this document as a reference (you link to it earlier in your email):

http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/using/search/

Finally, if you inserted objects using Riak's Key/Value operations,
you should delete them that way as well. Have you tried that?

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; I am trying riak search 2, and have followed instructions on
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/using/search/
&gt; to create an index and query an index without any problems.
&gt;
&gt; However, I could not delete values from the index by either i) using the
&gt; solr interface, or ii) search-cmd, I followed instructions on
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/references/search-indexing/
&gt;
&gt; Could you please help?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The error from the solr interface is as follows:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; curl -XPOST http://localhost:8098/solr/famous/update -H
&gt; 'content-type:text/xml' --data-binary @delete.xml
&gt;
