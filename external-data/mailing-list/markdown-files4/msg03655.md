&gt; All,
&gt;
&gt; The next few months will see a number of major new features and
&gt; changes dropping into the tip (aka HEAD) of the Riak codebase. The
&gt; team at Basho is very excited to get these new pieces of code out
&gt; there and we believe that this upcoming release will make Riak even
&gt; more reliable and easier to use.
&gt;
&gt; With this excitement in mind, I'd like to take a moment and remind the
&gt; community that we do NOT recommend using HEAD for production purposes.
&gt; While every commit is peer-reviewed and tested, there are times when
&gt; the code can be rough around the edges during feature integration.
&gt; Open Source is wonderful in that it lets us share new stuff earlier
&gt; and gather feedback on it. However, it also means you get to see (and
&gt; run) the code before it's had a chance to settle and be thoroughly
&gt; tested for release.
&gt;
&gt; As with all Riak releases in the past year, we will ensure that you
&gt; can do a rolling upgrade to the next release when it's available.
&gt; There just might be some bumpy air between here and there.
&gt;
&gt; Fasten your seatbelts and hang on, folks. It's gonna be fun. :)

I'm particularly interested in the range query support!
Hopefully a benchmark showcasing these new features will be released also.
Good job!

&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt; D.
