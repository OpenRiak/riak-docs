Gokhan has made a doodle thingy (I didn’t even knew that existed) to track 
availability:

Lets see when we can do it and then find a medium.

&gt; I'm down for a chat on how to finally get our collective stuff together. 
&gt; Maybe a google hangout?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have created a Slack channel. Here is the invitation link[1]
&gt; I think it is better to have a quick talk beforehand in Slack to
&gt; organize big meeting with a rest of Riak funs/lovers.
&gt; We are ready to provide some resources and i believe lots of folks
&gt; would like to do the same.
&gt; It would be very efficient to organize, as fast as possible.
&gt; For anyone missed, there is an alternate mail group[2] if this one
&gt; ripped of suddenly.

&gt; &gt; Great idea Heinz, I think speaking together is the right start.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I’m free next week, but a key member of our team is not. I know we’re never 
&gt; &gt; going to get everyone to agree on a time, but if we could do it early the 
&gt; &gt; following week it would suit more. Otherwise, I will attend and pass info 
&gt; &gt; along, so don’t worry. I think bet365 should be involved too. They probably 
&gt; &gt; have the largest team anywhere working on Riak.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe a doodle http://doodle.com/en\_GB/  would be 
&gt; &gt; a good thing?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Heya everyone,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I figured I’ll pick up the initiative here and see if we all can come 
&gt; &gt;&gt; together before fragmentation hits. Annette mentioned this today and I 
&gt; &gt;&gt; think she’s right.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; There are many people that want to see risk(\_core) continue to evolve and 
&gt; &gt;&gt; improve, out of the top of my head there are ES - who picked up support 
&gt; &gt;&gt; for riak, NHS/UK - which is using it and seem to keep doing so, there is 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Gordon, Annette, Chris, Tristan, Mariano and me who all have an interest 
&gt; &gt;&gt; to keep things going. I’m pretty sure I forgot a good few people (sorry! 
&gt; &gt;&gt; It doesn’t mean I love you any less, I just have a brain like a sieve).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Amongst all of us I’m sure we’ve quite some forks. Tristan, Chris, Mariano 
&gt; &gt;&gt; and me started https://github.com/Kyorai  to 
&gt; &gt;&gt; consolidate the git repos that correspond to the current hex packages as 
&gt; &gt;&gt; an example, NHS runs a fork of core at 
&gt; &gt;&gt; https://github.com/ramensen/riak\_core 
&gt; &gt;&gt;  and I guess ES will have one too 
&gt; &gt;&gt; by now. (Again apologies if I forgot someone).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am quite sure that all of us have the same goal and probably are 
&gt; &gt;&gt; interested in the same things (keeping riak(\_core) strong). So what I’d 
&gt; &gt;&gt; like to suggest is we find a time to sit together and chat about how we 
&gt; &gt;&gt; pool resources instead of trying to cross merge in N different places. 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps late next week EU afternoon US morning? Please raise a hand if 
&gt; &gt;&gt; interested, discuss and share times that would work for you :)
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Heinz
