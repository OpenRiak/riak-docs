Unfortunately that's not really a possibility. We selected Spidermonkey because 
it's lightweight and designed for embedded use cases. To do the same with Rhino 
would require embedding the JVM which would be problematic to embed in the same 
way.

I have thought about implementing an external interface for map and reduce 
phases similar to Hadoop's streams interface so users could perform maps and 
reduces using whatever technology is appropriate for them. Would this work for 
your use case?
