Hi,

I fell in love with riak and riak-cs, I have migrated all my stack on it
(originally from mongodb).
But I have one big issue. I have a lot of key to request simultaneously and
thanks for multi\_get implementation (ruby) it's already optimised for the
client side (concurrent requests). But I would like to know if any server
implementation to come because, in my case, it is very very slow to request
1000 objects (unlike mongodb).

You will make me the happiest man in the world. And I could take off my
hideous memory caching solution :-)

Thanks

Vincent Chavelle
