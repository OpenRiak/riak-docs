Hi,

No plans. Simply opening the conversation on how the community would like to 
receive (and take forward) the codebases.

Subject: Re: Riak and the demise of Basho

Given that all of the code except for MDC (and maybe JMX) is under Apache 2, I 
would assume that those components would follow the already existing license of 
the other components.

Is there a plan to change the original license on the open source product from 
Apache 2?

Thanks,
Christopher

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; A quick status update. Today bet365 have signed the agreement to purchase all 
&gt; Basho IP. We expect the agreement to be ratified in the US courts next week. 
&gt; Once cleared, our intention is to open source all code, help rebuild the 
&gt; community and collaboratively take the development of RIAK forward.
&gt;
&gt; In the coming weeks we will hopefully answer the questions people have and 
&gt; will be calling on the community to help forge the initial RIAK Roadmap.
&gt;
&gt; One of the initial questions we have for the community is which OSS license 
&gt; would people like applied to the code? Our thought is the most open and 
&gt; permissive.

&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt; I have been wanting to make you aware for a few weeks now that we have 
&gt; reached an agreement, in principle, to buy all of Basho's remaining assets 
&gt; (except support contracts) from the receiver. Up until this afternoon, I was 
&gt; constrained by some confidentiality needs of the receiver and was unable to 
&gt; speak.
&gt;
&gt; We have agreed a price for the assets and are almost at the end of 
&gt; sorting out the legal agreement. Once this is complete, this will then need 
&gt; to be processed through the courts which, I am advised, should take a week or 
&gt; so.
&gt;
&gt; It is our intention to open source all of Basho's products and all of the 
&gt; source code that they have been working on. We'll do this as quickly as we 
&gt; are able to organise it, and we would appreciate some input from the 
&gt; community on how you would like this done.
