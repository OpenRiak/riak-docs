All of the nodes appear to be out of file handles. When using LevelDB,
did you try setting {max\_open\_files, 20} (or some such) to ensure you
didn't exceed available ulimit -n? (This will be the default in RC2).

&gt;&gt;&gt; From watching top when the nodes crashed, it looked IO related. The IO
&gt;&gt;&gt; wait went up and then there was only one thread of beam.smp running
&gt;&gt;&gt; and it was using 100% CPU. Sometimes the nodes would recover after the
&gt;&gt;&gt; benchmark was stopped, sometimes one or two nodes would completely
&gt;&gt;&gt; crash. riak, not the OS.

&gt;&gt; Hi Phil,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Do you have any log files, core files or other backtrace information
&gt;&gt; from the crash? It's a little hard to have anything of substance to
&gt;&gt; say without more context. :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; D.
