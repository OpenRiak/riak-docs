Hi Jon,

The object passed to a JavaScript map function is documented here:
http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/MapReduce#MapReduce-Mapphasefunctions

There is also a logging function available (ejsLog):

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; I'm trying to figure out Riak's MapReduce using the Ruby client. I can't
&gt; seem to get even the simplest map/reduce to work:
&gt;
&gt; function(v){ var o = JSON.parse(v.values[0].data); return [o]; }
&gt;
&gt; So I thought I'd log what I was doing inside this function. I could not,
&gt; for the life of me, find a reference for the available Javascript functions,
&gt; objects, etc... that are available so I can do some debugging.
&gt;
&gt; What tools are available to me within a map/reduce function? There seems to
&gt; be some conflicting information, particularly regarding a "Riak" object that
&gt; I've seen referenced online. Couldn't find any docs on it, though.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks ahead of time!
