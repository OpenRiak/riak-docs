Hi Muntasir,

What repositories did you modify to provide this functionality? Does
it exist purely as a middleware layer, or was any work done on Riak
Core or KV?

&gt; Hi,

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am a PhD student working on distributed key-value storage systems like
&gt; Riak. Recently we have built an adaptive middleware framework which can
&gt; continuously tune kv store configurations (e.g., via existing tuning knobs,
&gt; and newly added/proposed knobs) to meet consistency/availability service
&gt; level agreements under changing network conditions. We have deployed our
&gt; system on top of Riak via a small amount of code change in Riak (which could
&gt; be submitted as a patch), so that kv store developers can automatically tune
&gt; the system to meet SLAs. Now we are interested to contribute to the Riak
&gt; community by adding our code to the Riak code base via a patch.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone kindly suggest how to go about this? Any suggestions would be
&gt; highly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; Muntasir.
