&gt; Interesting. Someone knows what this entropy thing is doing exactly? Can
&gt; it be switched off by default maybe?
&gt;

Here is a description of AAE when it was released in Riak 1.3
http://basho.com/introducing-riak-1-3/ You can turn off AAE in your
config files if you want it off. With Riak (and distributed systems in
general) there are always tradeoffs for any feature. Riak more than others
tends to pick 'safety' for the default case. AAE protects your data's
integrity even when not being read for a long time. It is a very important
feature, but we understand it does not fit everyone's needs, so we provide
the option to turn it off.

Hope that helps,
Jared
