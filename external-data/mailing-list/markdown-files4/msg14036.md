Hi,

I'm stress testing Riak on a reasonable cluster size (10 nodes), where 1
process constantly adds data, and various other processes read it, but
never update it (nor delete it).

I can see that when I add more processes to read the data, the
processing PUTing the data is affected, and its performance drops quite
a bit.

That was expected, but I was wondering if there is a way to force Riak
to handle PUT operations in priority, or any idea you may have. My goal
is to keep the data feeding process performance good, even if some
reader processes are pretty slow. It's ok if it's a hack or not
documented, I just would like to know what my options are. Also, is it
possible to setup GET throttling ?

Thanks,
dams
