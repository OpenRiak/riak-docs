Then if, for instance, I want to delete the first element, with curl -vvv
-XDELETE "http://10.100.2.1:8098/buckets/0/keys/1408027632,637895" I get

Then when I execute curl -vvv -XDELETE "
http://10.100.2.1:8098/buckets/0/keys/1408027632,637895" the same thing
happens, I get a "not found" error. I am not sure, but this sort of data
corruption could be due to me using comma in the key, but if you notice
towards the end there are some keys such as 2, 30, 9 that have no commas
and they behave the same. Additionally, I tried inserting with the same key
and some junk data, and it worked. I was able to delete the data that is
associated with the key, but the actual key still remained.

&gt; Hi Hristo,
&gt;
&gt; Please see my comments and questions inline...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am using riak version 1.4.10 and it is in a cluster with two hosts. I
&gt; am
&gt; &gt; unable to get rid of keys left over from previous operations using simple
&gt; &gt; delete operations on keys.
&gt;
&gt; Could you please try and delete the keys using "curl -vvv -XDELETE
&gt; http://...." and let us know the output? The "-vvv" argument will give
&gt; us the HTTP response code and will show all headers.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; When I list the keys for a bucket, it shows me
&gt; &gt; the old keys, however if I try to retrieve the data associated with a
&gt; key,
&gt; &gt; no data is found.
&gt;
&gt; Could you also paste the output when you retrieve a "deleted" key via
&gt; "curl -vvv -XGET http://...." ?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there a way to wipe the keys in the bucket so it starts from a clean
&gt; &gt; slate? I don't care about any of the data in riak, but I would rather not
&gt; &gt; have to reinstall everything again. What would happen If I just delete
&gt; &gt; everything from /var/lib in both hosts?
&gt;
&gt; Don't delete everything from /var/lib - you'll delete the ring and
&gt; other important directories. Find the value of data\_root for your data
&gt; backends, and then delete the contents of that directory. For
&gt; instance, /var/lib/riak/bitcask is the default data\_root for bitcask,
&gt; so to delete all the data you'd execute the following on all hosts:
&gt;
&gt; riak stop
&gt; rm -rf /var/lib/riak/bitcask/\*
&gt; riak start
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I also noticed that recently I did an update, and one of my clusters was
&gt; &gt; using leveldb as a backend and another was using bitcask. I updated the
&gt; &gt; configs so that both are using bitcask, but I am wondering if there is
&gt; some
&gt; &gt; stale data left over. In one of the clusters in /var/lib there is still a
&gt; &gt; leveldb folder. Is it safe to delete it?
&gt;
&gt; Yes if you are sure the data is no longer needed.
