Wish I could afford and justify the cost & time to attend. Maybe next year
:-)
Shame, as it's east coast (that alone seems rare) and it's near one of our
own clients...

&gt; I mentioned this in Friday's Recap but I figured it was worth asking
&gt; again: anyone going to Surge [1] next week? I'll be there along with
&gt; Sean Cribbs, Ian Plosker, Ryan Zezeski, and a few other members of the
&gt; Basho team. If you're attending and haven't already notified me, let
&gt; me know (or I'll have trouble buying you a beverage or two).
