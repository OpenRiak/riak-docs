Hi Wilson,

Internal to Erlang, the erlang:memory/0 function outputs information about
memory allocated by the Erlang emulator. This information would have to be
retrieved from the console of a running node but we may be able to add it to
the stats page of Riak:
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=599

You may also be able to monitor the memory usage of a Riak node with a third
party tool such as Nagios, Ganglia, Munin, Cacti, etc.

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I know one of the side effect of bitcask is, each node needs to have
&gt; enough ram to hold
&gt; the entire list of keys it's responsible for.
&gt;
&gt; is there a tool/method to check how much is being used so you can see
&gt; how close to
&gt; the limit you are? The alternative is to wait till bitcask blows up.
&gt; that seems like a bad idea :)
