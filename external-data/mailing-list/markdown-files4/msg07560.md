Thank you very much Justin.

Here's another command to hopefully speed up the handoff process.

On any of the node, attach to Erland console, then:

rp([{N, rpc:call(N, application, get\_env, [riak\_core, handoff\_concurrency])} || 
N &lt;- [node() | nodes()]]).

This command will show the current handoff\_concurrency number. The result could 
be:

[{'riak@10.20.2.243',{ok,1}}, 
 {'riak@10.20.2.242',{ok,1}}, 
 {'riak@10.20.2.244',{ok,1}}, 
 {'riak@10.20.2.245',{ok,1}}]

Then, to change handoff\_concurrency to, say, 4, issue this command:

rp(rpc:multicall([node() | nodes()], application, set\_env, [riak\_core, 
handoff\_concurrency, 4])).

Justin was very helpful to guide me along the process. He showed me those 
commands. Thanks again, Justin!

Cheers,
Nam

&gt; To recap the upshot of our offline chat tonight:
&gt; Though the leave operations on your cluster progressed fine, in the future I
&gt; would just take the damaged nodes down, do the repair like I mentioned in
&gt; the earlier post in this thread, and bring the nodes back up. No membership
&gt; changes should be required.
