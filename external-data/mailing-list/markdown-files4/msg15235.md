I have an existed schema and I want to add one column in it, such as



What's the steps to update it?

Since there is the search\_index related to the schema and a bucket type
related to the search\_index.

I tried to update the schema by the following commands:

{ok, SchemaData} = file:read\_file("cartoons.xml"),
riakc\_pb\_socket:create\_search\_schema(Pid, &lt;&lt;"cartoons"&gt;&gt;, SchemaData).


However, I can not search the object with new field.

Thanks in advance.
