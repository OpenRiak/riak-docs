Hi Luke,

Yes, I think I will go with /search instead; should be enough.

Thanks,
Alex

&gt; Hi Alex,

&gt; Benchmarking is the only sure way to know if you need to add this
&gt; additional complexity to your system for your own use-case or if
&gt; search in Riak 2.0 will suffice. I suspect the latter will be true.

&gt; &gt; Hi Fred,

&gt; &gt; Yeah, I realised that on my testing node with n\_val of 3 I was getting
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; triple of results in the count... that is not ideal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was just concerned on how much extra-work would get Riak to talk with
&gt; SOLR
&gt; &gt; and compile data against hitting SOLR directly... For my tests these
&gt; days,
&gt; &gt; seems the /search interface is pretty fast and it may not be a real
&gt; problem
&gt; &gt; for Riak... but still have my fears from Riak 0.14 an Riak 1.4
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Alex,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Other people have chimed in, but let me repeat that while the
&gt; &gt;&gt; internal\_solr interface is accessible via HTTP (and needs to be, at
&gt; least
&gt; &gt;&gt; from Riak processes), you cannot use that interface to query Solr and
&gt; expect
&gt; &gt;&gt; a correct result set (unless you are using a single node cluster with an
&gt; &gt;&gt; n\_val of 1).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; When you run your queries through Riak, Yokozuna, the component that
&gt; &gt;&gt; interfaces with Solr, will use a riak\_core coverage plan to generate a
&gt; &gt;&gt; distributed Solr filter query across the entire cluster that guarantees
&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; for any document stored on all Solr nodes in the cluster, the query will
&gt; &gt;&gt; select one (and only one) replica. If you were to run your query
&gt; locally
&gt; &gt;&gt; using the internal\_solr interface, your query would not span the cluster
&gt; &gt;&gt; (likely missing documents on other nodes) and may have duplicates
&gt; (e.g., in
&gt; &gt;&gt; degenerate cases where you have more than one replica on the same node).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I hope that helps explain why using the internal\_solr interface is not
&gt; &gt;&gt; only not recommended, it's also not going to give you the results you
&gt; &gt;&gt; expect.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
