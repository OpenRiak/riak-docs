&gt;&gt; I personally don't like using ambiguous short names. I get that you can 
&gt;&gt; technically distinguish things by package name but using a simple name that 
&gt;&gt; is very common isn't good for code readability. "RiakEntry" is unambiguous, 
&gt;&gt; self-documenting, and semantically correct. "Entry" would, in my mind, 
&gt;&gt; represent a very generic interface that defined various kinds of "Entry"s of 
&gt;&gt; things.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Likewise, I'd like to suggest RiakDoc

I can see why but I think that might be too specific, not every entry in riak 
is a document (but every document in riak is an entry.)
