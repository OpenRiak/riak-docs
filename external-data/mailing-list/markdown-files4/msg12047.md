Hey,

I talked to you on IRC. For this particular route, you need to use the URL 
/buckets?buckets=true to list buckets and stop getting the error. (Listing 
buckets is relatively expensive [citation needed], hence the requirement for 
the query parameter).

I think lots of our engineers are working hard on other parts of riak\_kv, but 
feel free to file an issue that you probably shouldn't get a stacktrace and 
should instead get a nice error message.

&gt; I did something strange to my Riak and it works for some operations, but
