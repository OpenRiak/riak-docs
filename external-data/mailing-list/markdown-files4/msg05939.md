Hi Anthony,

Thanks for your reaction.

&gt;From what I gathered from the Riak source code I am indeed afraid we have to 
&gt;go with some home-grown solution.
As we have a somewhat different structure (multiple sites with multiple data 
stores) I think that we keep to our home-grown Dynamo ring software.
(It is simple enough to write in Erlang...)

I will, however, borrow some code from Riak, think of stats etc. 
And hope to add an adaptor where other users can plug Riak for their own data 
store.

What kind of C database backend did you use?

After some benchmarking we think that in our case (many more reads than writes) 
sqlite3, PostgreSQL and MySQL will do fine.


Groeten,

Marc

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; It almost sounds like you might just want to investigate use riak\_core
&gt; instead of full blown riak. The riak\_core component only deals with
&gt; ring management and messaging. We've used it to create a completely
&gt; different distributed store with a thrift frontend and custom C database
&gt; backend. You could probably swap out your home-grown Dynamo software
&gt; with just riak\_core?
