actualy no, if you use riak pipes and want to execute pipe where data
located, you should choose chashfun, which will produce chash of {Bucket,
Key} and then riak\_pipe choose partiotion fo you. But afaik there no
guarantee that data located there, you could go further by pref list.
Usualy you need riak\_core\_util:chash\_key/1 to do this. But how riak\_pipes
choose parition list for you by this 160-bit chash i dont know.
