Thatâ€™s correct; you should reduce per-node allocation by adding additional 
nodes. 

However, to minimize the amount of data that needs to be relocated, you should 
add all nodes together rather than one at a time. This prevents the situation 
where some percentage of the data gets moved between nodes multiple times.
