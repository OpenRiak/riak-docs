&gt; Hi, I’m curious what Erlang shell within riak is used for (one which
&gt; appears with “riak attach” command) and if cluster operator would be able
&gt; to use it to make small queries without need to build client application?
&gt; And is there some kind of documentation for it? I’ve tried to use same
&gt; functions as Erlang client assuming that this shell is just build-in
&gt; interface; however, it throw undefined function exception at me, so
&gt; probably I was wrong. \*\*\*\*
