Hi Seth,

&gt; I had a similar problem. I mitigated the problem by appending a

&gt; This way I don't have to worry about waiting for Riak to reap
&gt; tombstones after 3 seconds and I don't have to use
&gt; delete\_mode=immediate. I still do a list keys + delete before each
&gt; test.
I think this is what I'm going to have to do. I tried all the different 
delete\_mode settings, but none of them seemed to help. Thanks for the 
suggestion!
