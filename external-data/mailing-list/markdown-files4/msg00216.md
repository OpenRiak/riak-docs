Hi Kevin,

Thanks for your feedback. Comments below:

&gt; \* Multiple sequential map phases only work if each map phase emits ONLY

I was aware of that, and as far as I know I'm abiding by that. The one
potentially wonky thing I'm doing is returning \*potential\* bucket,key
combinations and letting the next phase verify that they actually exist.
 That was working before, and, as I mentioned, is still working locally.


&gt; \* The Javascript environment provides a function, ejsLog(), which you can
&gt; use to debug M/R jobs. You call it like this: ejsLog("/path/to/log/file",
&gt; "StringToLog")


Thanks, that should help. I'll poke around and report back if I find
anything interesting.

Jimmy
