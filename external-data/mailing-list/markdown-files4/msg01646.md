&gt; Alrighty, I've done a little more digging.  When I throttle the writes
&gt; heavily (2/sec) and set R and W to 1 all around, the cluster works just fine
&gt; after I restart the node for about 15-20 seconds.  Then the read request
&gt; hangs for about a minute, until node D disappears from connected\_nodes in
&gt; riak-admin status, at which point it returns the desired value (although
&gt; sometimes I get a 503):

Are you seeing any error messages in log/erlang.log.\* or log/sasl-error.log?

Can you expound on your use case a little -- are you doing a large
insert, or just a random read/write mix? Did you pre-populate the
dataset? Why are you using r=1, instead of relying on quorom for
reads?

How are you running the riak-admin status to measure the 15-20 seconds?

Thanks.

D.
