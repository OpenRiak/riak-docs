Thanks for the quick reply Dmitri!

Given your insight below, I'm wondering in Riak v2.x, whether it would be
possible to include a feature that automatically creates the index for you
behind the scenes so that indeed GET url/bucket(s) would return the keys. 
Just a thought...

&gt; You're probably wondering what you should do instead of list keys, to

&gt; The answer is - use an index of some sort. (Incidentally, with relational
&gt; databases, you're usually using an index, too -- very rare are the cases
&gt; where you're doing SELECT \* on a table with no primary index).
