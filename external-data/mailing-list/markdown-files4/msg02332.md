I'm not sure. I think it would depend on the number of JavaScript MR engines 
you have running, the operations you're performing, and the amount of data that 
is being read into memory.

&gt; &gt; I don't know how well Riak would behave otherwise in an environment that 
&gt; &gt; tight. I'd think you'd be limited to single key lookups, but I have been 
&gt; &gt; wrong before.
&gt; 
&gt; So you think it might not be possible to run map-reduce functions?
