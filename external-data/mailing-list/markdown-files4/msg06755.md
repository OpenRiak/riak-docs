Hi Doug,

Can you confirm the "Content-Type" header is set to "application/json" by
reading the JSON objects you stored?

Can you share an example JSON object as well as an example query you are
running with "search-cmd"?

Thank you,
Dan

&gt; I'm having trouble with riak-search. If I use the seach-cmd command line

&gt; protocol buffers client, in a bucket which has the search pre-commit
&gt; trigger installed, searches in that index always return 0 matches for
&gt; search terms which have matches in the bucket. (I have saved these objects
&gt; to the bucket after the pre-commit trigger was installed.)
&gt;
&gt; Is there a trick to this? It is my understanding that there is a default
&gt; schema for JSON objects, which should be sufficient as a starting point.
