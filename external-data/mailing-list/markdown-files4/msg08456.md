Hello,

I'm a complete newbie in the riak world, and I'd like to understand a 
basic thing.


I'm testing and trying to query riak with a basic map, which is \*very\* 
similar to the basho fast-track first example 
(http://wiki.basho.com/attachments/simple-map.json)


The thing is that I can't seem to manage to make this work with 
riak-defined keys.


Here's a gist to illustrate my problem : https://gist.github.com/3636321
1 - I POST data with cURL (the content of the two lines are identical 
except for the keys)


2- I try to MapReduce (currently without any filters)

3- the Output I get, the first one's got an error that I cannot (yet) 
understand :)


Could anyone help me to make my first steps in MapReducing ? :-)

Thanks!

Antoine
