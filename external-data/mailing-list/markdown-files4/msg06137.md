Ouch.

I'm shocked that is not considered a major bug. At minimum that kind of stuff 
should be front and center in their wiki/docs. Here I am thinking n 2 on a 3 
node cluster means I'm covered when in fact I am not. It's the whole reason I 
gave Riak consideration.

I think you may have this backwards. N=3 and 2 nodes would mean one node 
has 1 copy, and 1 node has 2 copies, of any given piece. For n=2 and 3 
nodes, there should be no overlap.


The other thing to consider is that for certain combinations of 
partition number P and node number N, distributing partitions mod N can 
result in overlaps at the edge of the ring. This means zero to n 
preflists can overlap on some nodes. That means n=3 can, \*with the wrong 
choice of N and P\*, result in minimum 2 machines having copies of any 
given key, assuming P &gt; N.


There are also failure modes to consider. I haven't read the new key 
balancing algo, so my explanation may be out of date.
