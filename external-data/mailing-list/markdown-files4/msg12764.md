I don't recommend trying to watch both streams at the same time. I tried
last year and ended missing them both.

&gt; Hey Dave,
&gt;
&gt; You'll wanna keep an eye on http://ricon.io/live.html
&gt;
&gt; Live stream of both track rooms, autoscaling multi bitrate, all devices
&gt; supported.
&gt;
&gt; Enjoy, and hopefully we'll see you at a RICON sometime in the future.

&gt; Every RICON talk is indeed broadcast live. I don't recall how we make that
&gt; information available, but watch the @Basho account on Twitter next Tuesday
&gt; (and the "team" list under the @Basho account will likely be abuzz as well).

&gt; When you say "it's time to gather around some great speakers (virtually or
&gt; in person) and talk distributed systems" are you saying some of the \*
&gt; speakers\* will be virtual, or is there a way for us to actually watch the
&gt; talks virtually? That's something I'd pay for, even though I can't attend
&gt; the conference in person.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,

&gt; It's exciting to learn the 2.0 tech preview is getting so close!
&gt; Looking forward to kicking the tires (currently in development w/
&gt; 1.4.2)

&gt; &gt; More importantly, RICON all the things! It's the end of October, which
&gt; means it's time to gather around some great speakers (virtually or in
&gt; person) and talk distributed systems. There are still a handful of tickets
&gt; available if you can join us next week:

&gt; we'll be talking about onstage:
