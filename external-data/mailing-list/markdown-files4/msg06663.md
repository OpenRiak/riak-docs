&gt; Hello Riakers,
&gt;
&gt; I am new to Riak/Riak Core.  I would like to learn some small-sized
&gt; Riak Core examples to learn different aspects of Riak Core.
&gt;
&gt; I found three old examples in the bolg from the blog (Basho Banjo , 4
&gt; examples in "try try try", and riak\_id), but I would like to try more.
&gt;  Are there other recommendations?
&gt;
&gt; Lastly, when I wanted to try Basho Banjo &lt;
&gt; https://github.com/rustyio/BashoBanjo &gt;, I cannot find the folder
&gt; rel/basho\_banjo.  I noticed that the readme file is not updated after
&gt; moving to the new repository.  Does some one know what's happing here?
&gt;
&gt; With Thanks

 Hello!

 I have used Riak-Core as a distributed application execution
environment, where:
 \* OS-processes (like RabbitMQ, Java, NodeJS, even Riak) could have
been created / stopped and queried;
 \* provided a distributed D-Bus-like communication framework
between these processes;

 (Unfortunately I didn't finish the implementation (it works but
its in alpha state), and because of time-constraints we're moving
towards a more classical approach.)

 But you could take a look at the Riak-Core related part of the code:
 \* process control and communication:
 
https://bitbucket.org/cipriancraciun/mosaic-node/src/bddda085dce8/applications/mosaic-node/sources/mosaic\_cluster\_processes\_vnode.erl
 
https://bitbucket.org/cipriancraciun/mosaic-node/src/bddda085dce8/applications/mosaic-node/sources/mosaic\_cluster\_processes.erl
 \* simplified version of a memory backed key-value store:
 
https://bitbucket.org/cipriancraciun/mosaic-node/src/bddda085dce8/applications/mosaic-node/sources/mosaic\_cluster\_storage\_vnode.erl
 
https://bitbucket.org/cipriancraciun/mosaic-node/src/bddda085dce8/applications/mosaic-node/sources/mosaic\_cluster\_storage.erl
 \* helper functions for common operations -- ring operations and
queries, etc.:
 
https://bitbucket.org/cipriancraciun/mosaic-node/src/bddda085dce8/applications/mosaic-node/sources/mosaic\_cluster\_tools.erl

 Also from the examples I've seen so far on the Internet mine have
the handoff better exposed (i.e. more elaborated). (Although the code
looks ugly like hell because of the `case` nesting...)

 If you have questions please ask.

 Ciprian.

 P.S.: It uses the Riak-Core from 0.14 version.
