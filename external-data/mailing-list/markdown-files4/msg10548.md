&gt; Bucket creation is one of the operations handled by 'stanchion'. So, make
&gt; sure you've install stanchion installed on only one node and that all
&gt; riak-cs nodes are pointing at that one stanchion node.
&gt;

Yep that's the case. Stanchion is running fine it seems, nothing in the
logs, all IP/ports match in /etc/{stanchion,riak,riak-cs}/app.config. Only
one node and one IP for now.


&gt; If that all looks fine, the second thing to check is that the admin
&gt; credentials match between riak-cs and stanchion.
&gt;

They all look good in config files (same credentials in local ~/.s3cfg,
server's /etc/riak-cs/app.config and server's /etc/stanchion/app.config).
Didn't really know if it has been (or even needs to be) reloaded. A
"/etc/init.d/... reload" worked on riak / stanchion but failed on riak-cs
("Node 'riak-cs@33.33.33.10' not responding to pings.") so I issued a
restart of riak+riak-cs.


&gt; Hopefully one of those is the problem and it is an easy fix. If not, just
&gt; reply back and we can work through it.
&gt;

Same result in the end, still the same trace and error message. Forgot to
mention riak, riak-cs and stanchion all are in 1.3.0 version.

Thanks for your help,

Jean-Baptiste
