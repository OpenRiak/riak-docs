&gt; &gt; thanks again for your clarifications and pointers. I will take a look at
&gt; them. There is just one point that you left out. Will there still be the
&gt; links entry in the object meta so that I can store links and walk them
&gt; manually (using MR)? Or will this functionality completely disappear with
&gt; link walking being weed out?
&gt;
&gt; The links entry is stored in the metadata and will stay untouched.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; - Chris
