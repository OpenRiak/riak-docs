&gt; Riak Users,

&gt; We are overjoyed to announce the final release of Riak 2.0.0.
&gt;
&gt; The documentation page  has been
&gt; completely redone and updated for 2.0, so please see that for the most
&gt; complete information on 2.0. A full listing of the new features in 2.0,
&gt; along with links to all the relevant docs, can be found in Intro to 2.0
&gt; , while a guide to
&gt; upgrading to version 2.0 can be found in our 2.0 upgrade guide
&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; Downloads can also be found on the documentation page
&gt; , and Apt/Yum repositories
&gt; can be found on our packagecloud.io page
&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; The complete release notes for 2.0.0 can be found on GitHub
&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; There are roughly 700 people in our THANKS file, and about 30 tags were
&gt; made for 2.0 from the first “pre” to now. We appreciate both the patience
&gt; and the feedback of all of Riak’s users through this long release cycle.
&gt;
&gt; From the entire Basho team, thanks!
