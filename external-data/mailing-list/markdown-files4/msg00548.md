Morning, Afternoon, Evening to all,

Just a short recap for today as I assume no one has time to read since
you're all too busy playing with the new 0.11 release... Right?

Enjoy -

1) Yesterday I posted slides from the Basho Bench Webinar. As
promised, here is a link to the actual code.

Go forth and benchmark!

On Bitbucket ---&gt; http://bitbucket.org/basho/basho\_bench
On Github ---&gt; http://github.com/basho/basho\_bench

We also added a page to the wiki that is all about basho\_bench usage ---&gt;
