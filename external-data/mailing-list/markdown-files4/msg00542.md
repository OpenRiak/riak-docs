Riak Recap for 6/8

1) Q --- Can someone recommend some erlang application web
application using riak as a backend? would look how people have
modeled their data etc. (from clipartcat via #riak)

 A --- For a pure Erlang app, this is a good place to start ---&gt;
http://rklophaus.squarespace.com/blog/2009/12/5/nitrogen-riak-and-1000-lines-of-erlang.html

 For non-erlang apps built with Riak, check out the sample apps here ---&gt;

2) @rklophaus wrote a dynamite recap of Berlin Buzzwords Day 2.

2a) @roidrage showed some great German hospitality to @rklophaus
during his Berlin stay ---&gt;

Thanks, Mattias, for keeping the Riak Devs well nourished whilst on the road!

3) Dzone wrote a great post based on Mozilla's choice of Riak over Cassandra.

4) It sounds like @seancribbs is fresh out of Riak SWAG at Railsconf,
but that shouldn't stop you from seeking him out and picking his
brain. Who knows, you might end up being part of a "Flash Cluster" as
seen here ---&gt; http://tweetphoto.com/26286773 (h/t to @wearefound
for providing pic).

5) The slides from Basho's recent benchmarking webinar just hit the wires.

Check them out here ---&gt;

(HINT: There may be some basho\_bench code to go with these slides
tomorrow...stay tuned.)
