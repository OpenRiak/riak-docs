Very, very good idea!


2010/10/5 Mark Phillips :
&gt; Hey All,
&gt;
&gt; We are pushing to get some more resources out the door to help the
&gt; community better use Riak. Specifically, we are doing tons of work at
&gt; the moment to make MapReduce in Riak more robust and as simple to use
&gt; as possible. This is happening not only through code enhancement but
&gt; also through various documentation additions.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure if you're all familiar with projects like Clojure Contrib
&gt; --- http://github.com/richhickey/clojure-contrib --- but we thought
&gt; this would be a great model for our own Contrib Library. So, we are
&gt; creating something called "Riak Function Contrib." Â When launched,
&gt; it'll be a home for community-contributed MapReduce and Pre- and
&gt; Post-Commit functions. The goal is to have Riak users submit code they
&gt; have used in their own apps and projects to build out a comprehensive
&gt; collection of functions such that, when a new user needs/wants to use
&gt; M/R or or Hook Functions in their app, they can browse the soon-to-be
&gt; vast number of functions that are already available and tested by
&gt; developers.
&gt;
&gt; The code will live on GitHub and there will be a sister-site with an
&gt; overview of what Riak Function Contrib is all about. When the repo and
&gt; site are up and running, code submission will be as simple as forking
&gt; the repo and sending a pull request. Using the code from the repo will
&gt; be just as easy.
&gt;
&gt; You'll notice I said "When launched..." It's not ready yet for several
&gt; reasons, one of which is because we wanted to put some code in there
&gt; at launch time. As I said, over time we are hooping it'll fill out
&gt; quite nicely, but we would like to have some functions in there to
&gt; start things off. So, if you've got MapReduce and/or Pre- and Post-
&gt; Commit functions that you are up for sharing with the community, I
&gt; want to hear from you. Shoot me an email and I'll give you the details
&gt; on how to get involved.
&gt;
&gt; And of course, thanks for being a part of Riak.
&gt;
&gt; Best,
&gt;
