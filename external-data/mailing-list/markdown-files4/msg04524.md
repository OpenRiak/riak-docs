That's the advice I usually give and the exact same reasons I give it. 

In an off-list email (as Jonathan knows), I equated it to saying "You should 
never do RDBMS development without a big enterprise grade server with $500k of 
SAN behind it." I typically say to build a dev environment that is as close to 
production as will give you production-like performance. Putting 3 nodes on my 
crappy stock laptop HDD isn't going to give me anything remotely like a 
production environment (wellâ€¦ there is always EC2 performance). 

We see these questions a lot on the list and I don't feel that telling clients 
"Well, it's gonna suck until you get it into production" isn't the best 
possible answer. A lot of people seem to be developing on 3-node clusters made 
out of Mac Minis, HP micro servers, and EC2; but even more people seem to be 
developing on laptops and wondering why they're seeing horrible performance.

&gt; Agreed, if your intention is to grow the existing single-node instance into a 
&gt; multi-node cluster, then yes, that's a problem.
&gt; For our own development environment, we run a single-node instance for our 
&gt; current stage of development, then once our app is more stable, we'll drop 
&gt; that single-node instance and create a proper 3+ node cluster for a dev 
&gt; environment that will look closer to the final production setup.

&gt; N-node cluster. Changing the N value of a key that already exists,
&gt; especially where N is increasing relative to its old value, creates many
