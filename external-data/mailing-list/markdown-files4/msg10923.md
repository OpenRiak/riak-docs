What's interesting is that Pavlo Baron mentions a heavily modified Disco,
that he altered to make it run alongside each Riak node. I wonder if those
mods are available?
It would be great to talk to him about this.

&gt;&gt; Is written in Erlang ( the core app ) but the MR jobs are written in

&gt;&gt; are written in JavaScript ( also can be written in Erlang though )

&gt;&gt; Has anyone tried to use Riak with Disco? [ http://discoproject.org ] I
&gt;&gt; was looking for Hadoop alternatives ( as the RIAK-HADOOP connector project
&gt;&gt; seems not going anywhere ) and I think Disco is quite interesting, moreover
&gt;&gt; is written in Erlang same as Riak. Looks like it would be a good match!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Looks interesting, though it's It's written in Python from what I can
&gt;&gt; see, not Erlang ;) Still makes a refreshing change yet-another-java-thing
&gt;&gt; though.
