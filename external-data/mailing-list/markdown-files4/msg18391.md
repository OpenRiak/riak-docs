"However there are alternatives under active development."... can you
please list them? I'm also interested on a CS alternative.

Thanks,
Alex

&gt; Hi Stefan
&gt; On the one hand, even before the demise of Basho, they’d stopped
&gt; supporting Riak CS. On the other, there is an organisation based in Japan,
&gt; but with an international remote team, that supports other CS customers, so
&gt; may well be a choice of support.
&gt;
&gt; The CS code base has not had a huge amount of recent attention, but there
&gt; are plenty of people running at, in industry, at reasonable scale.
&gt;
&gt; There’s a genuine market of providers of ex-Basho products, and a
&gt; community of CS users. However there are alternatives under active
&gt; development.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi everybody,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm new to Riak-CS and just joined the group.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We've been exploring Riak-CS now for a couple of days and consider it as
&gt; a potential inhouse-alternative to external S3-based storage providers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Given the last commit was in January 2016, the question rose as to how
&gt; well the project is supported and how mature the solution is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd be very thankful for any comments from the community on this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Best regards
&gt; &gt; Stefan
