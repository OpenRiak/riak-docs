Hey Santi, Baskar,

Are you noticing increased CPU load as you create more and more indexes? 
Running `riak-admin top -interval 2` a few times may bring sometime to light.

I’d see how you could increase resources or think more critically on how you’re 
indexing data for Solr. Does the data share most fields? Can you reuse indexes 
for some of the data and filter certain queries?

You may also wanted to look at this thread, 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nosql-databases/9ECQpVS0QjE 
, which 
discusses modeling Riak Search data and the issues you’ll have with the 
overhead with gossiping so much metadata and the what Solr can handle.

&gt; Hi Zeeshan,
&gt; 
&gt; We have typically seen this issue when we have lots of indexes created in 
&gt; that instance. On a t2.medium machine we already have around 512+ indexes 
&gt; created in data folder. In such case, if we trying to create any new indexes 
&gt; it's taking time. Association of Index to Bucket is failing even after the 
&gt; FetchIndex operation returning sucess as shown in the below code.
&gt; 
&gt; is there any limitation of the number of Indexes? Any thing related to 
&gt; FileSystem handlers causing this issue?
&gt; 
&gt; while(!isCreated){
&gt; 
&gt; FetchIndex fetchIndex = new FetchIndex.Builder(indexName).build();
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; RiakFuture String&gt; fetchIndexFuture = client.executeAsync(fetchIndex);
&gt; 
&gt; try{
&gt; 
&gt; fetchIndexFuture.await();
&gt; 
&gt; com.basho.riak.client.core.operations.YzFetchIndexOperation.Response 
&gt; response = fetchIndexFuture.get();
&gt; 
&gt; List indexes = response.getIndexes();
&gt; 
&gt; for(YokozunaIndex index:indexes){
&gt; 
&gt; if(indexName.equals(index.getName())){
&gt; 
&gt; isCreated=true;
&gt; 
&gt; logger.info("Index "+indexName+" created ");
&gt; 
&gt; continue;
&gt; 
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; }catch(Exception e){
&gt; 
&gt; logger.warn("Unable to get "+indexName+" Still trying");
&gt; 
&gt; isCreated=false;
&gt; 
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; }

&gt; Hello Baskar, Santi,
&gt; 
&gt; 2-15 minutes is a long while, and we’ve not seen index creation/propagation 
&gt; be so slow. I’d definitely take a closer look at how you’re creating these 
&gt; indexes dynamically on the fly, as index creation is typically a more 
&gt; straightforward admin task.
&gt; 
&gt; We’ve added defaults to solrconfig.xml to handle most typical use-cases. You 
&gt; can read more about solrconfig.xml at 
&gt; http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrConfigXml#mainIndex\_Section 
&gt; . You may want 
&gt; to take another look and optimize/improve your schema design to prevent such 
&gt; issues. You can read more about Solr’s performance factors here -&gt; 
&gt; http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrPerformanceFactors 
&gt; . 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Hello Zeeshan,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the pointer regarding waiting for index creation in each node in 
&gt;&gt; the cluster.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Presently, when the indices get created on one node, it takes a full 2-15 
&gt;&gt; minutes for it to get created on other nodes in the cluster. Following are 
&gt;&gt; the timestamps on 3 nodes for a single index:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; #Create index request from our server via load balancer
&gt;&gt; 11:16:52.999 [http-bio-8080-exec-3] INFO c.v.s.u.RiakClientUtil - Created 
&gt;&gt; index for bsr-test-fromlocal-1-Access\_index
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; #1st node, immediate creation (12 secs) once call is issued from our server
&gt;&gt; 2015-03-05 19:17:04.135 [info] &lt;0.17388.104&gt;@yz\_index:local\_create:189 
&gt;&gt; Created index bsr-test-fromlocal-1-Access\_index with schema
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; #2nd node, takes another 4 minutes for creation request to propagate
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2015-03-05 19:21:17.879 [info] &lt;0.20606.449&gt;@yz\_index:local\_create:189 
&gt;&gt; Created index bsr-test-fromlocal-1-Access\_index
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; #3rd node, takes 15 minutes for creation request to propagate
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2015-03-05 19:32:32.172 [info] &lt;0.14715.94&gt;@yz\_index:local\_create:189 
&gt;&gt; Created index bsr-test-fromlocal-1-Access\_index
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is there a solr config we can tune to make the 2nd and 3rd node propagation 
&gt;&gt; more immediate in the order of &lt; 60 seconds?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Baskar

&gt;&gt; Hello Santi, Baskar. Please keep your messages on the user group mailing 
&gt;&gt; list, btw. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Here’s an example of our testing harness’s wait\_for\_index function, 
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/develop/riak\_test/yz\_rt.erl#L420 
&gt;&gt; . 
&gt;&gt; We check for the index on each of the nodes, which is an approach you can 
&gt;&gt; take. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; And, as I mentioned, I’m currently working on making Index creation 
&gt;&gt; synchronous to make this easier.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If your logs are not pointing to any errors and being that your bucket, 
&gt;&gt; index contains so few objects, I’d delete or mv the search-root/index 
&gt;&gt; directory (./data/yz/&lt;&gt;) and let AAE resync the data, which 
&gt;&gt; should then give you consistent results.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
