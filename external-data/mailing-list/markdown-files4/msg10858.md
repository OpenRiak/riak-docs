Hi Elias,

&gt; We have a need to store data in Riak CS and it would be rather useful if we
&gt; could search on it without having to stand up another cluster of
&gt; Yokozuna/ElasticSearch/SolrCloud to do so.
&gt;

This is certainly something we've discussed and have been asked for,
but there's nothing concrete on the roadmap just yet. We're thinking
about it but there's no timeline for anything just yet.
