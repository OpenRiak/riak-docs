Many thanks, Jon. Please bear in mind that the examples I extended were just
the first two I could think of - as you know, the REST API is considerably
more subtle and feature-rich than PBC. That said, the combination of
conditional PUT and GET and bucket properties would probably hit 70% of the
common cases I find myself wanting.
