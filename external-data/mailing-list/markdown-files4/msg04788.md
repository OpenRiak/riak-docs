Hi Bryan,
Sorry for the delay, I was away. I shutdown that experiment, but intend to
try out one of the new prerelease's when I get the time. I'll try out what
you suggest if it brings up the same problems. I was running Ripple using
HTTP FYI.

&gt; Hi, Ryan. From the log messages you've pasted so far, it looks like
&gt; something decided to shutdown the MapReduce pipe explicitly ("Reason:
&gt; killed"). That can happen if there is a problem sending inputs, or if
&gt; the request times out. In either of those cases, you should have
&gt; received an error on the client side: anything interesting in your
&gt; Ruby logs?
&gt;
&gt; It's possible that there is an oversight in the new Riak Pipe plumbing
&gt; of MapReduce. Could you please try your experiment again, but set
&gt; 'mapred\_system' to 'legacy' (not 'pipe') in riak\_kv's app.config,
&gt; please? If your query works on the legacy system, would you be able
&gt; to share it, so we could find the oversight? It would also be useful
&gt; to know whether you have Ripple using HTTP or Protocol Buffers.
