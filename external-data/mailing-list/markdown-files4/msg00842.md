I was going to suggest you to take a look at Redis, but you are already
aware of it. Redis is a completely different beast than Riak, with a
completely different roadmap for distributability, complex because of the
commands operating in data structures.

You could look at Voldemort with its pluggable types, maybe it works for
you.

In the end for any non trivial/toy problem is difficult not to end with at
least 2 or 3 persistence solutions working together, there ain't silver
bullet.

Hi guys,

Is there any plan for supporting more than opaque blobs as values in
the future? For example, lists, sets, hashes etc, including
server-side support for operating on those data-types?

In the meantime, I am curious about the feasibility of putting
riak\_core in front of Redis, and supporting a richer API in the layers
above (which I suspect would need to be heavily modified to support
additional value manipulation functionality).

Also, is anyone aware of anyone attempting such a project?

Cheers,
