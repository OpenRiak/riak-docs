&gt; thanks again for your clarifications and pointers. I will take a look at 
&gt; them. There is just one point that you left out. Will there still be the 
&gt; links entry in the object meta so that I can store links and walk them 
&gt; manually (using MR)? Or will this functionality completely disappear with 
&gt; link walking being weed out?

The links entry is stored in the metadata and will stay untouched.

Thanks,
