Given Mathias Meyer's talk at Scotland Ruby Conference about eventmachine 
programming (while wearing a Riak t-shirt!), I was hoping to see a little bit 
more in terms of eventmachine clients and Riak.

Has anyone used EventMachine and/or em-synchrony with Riak and could give me 
some advice? I'm using ruby-riak-client at this point and going the route of 
trying to wrap my workflow in fibers so riak client plays nice with it.

Am I better off just using a HTTP client like EM::HttpRequest or 
EM::Synchrony::Multi, or is there some good way to use ruby-riak-client or 
ripple with eventmachine that requires less manual intervention?

Sorry if this has been covered somewhere else but I haven't had much luck 
finding anyone else using EM with Riak.

Thanks,
Sean McKibben
