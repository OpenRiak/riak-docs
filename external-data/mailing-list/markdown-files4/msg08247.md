Hi Daniel,

Since Riak 1.0, node id's are used to resolve conflicts in place of
client id's. While supplying the client ID won't hurt anything, Riak
will ignore it.

You can read more about this here:

Thanks!

&gt; I've read somewhere some time ago that each client connecting to Riak

&gt;
&gt; I just found in RawClient and in IRiakClient
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; /\*\*
&gt;
&gt; \* If you don't set a client id explicitly at least call this to set

&gt;
&gt; \*
&gt; \* @return the generated clientId for the client
&gt;
&gt; \*/
&gt;
&gt; byte[] generateAndSetClientId() throws IOException;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Would that be a way to go or is it now all automatically resolved via vector
&gt; clocks?
