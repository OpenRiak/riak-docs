Can you confirm that the PR didn't made it into 1.3.0? It was closed about two 
four weeks ago...

I think I'm hitting the same issue here. In one project I'm using last write 
wins and the read repair count is ridiculously high. I'm hoping that this might 
also help reducing the latency problem we are seeing for the 99th+ percentiles 
of requests.
