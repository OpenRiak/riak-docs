I've been looking at CEPH a lot lately. Object storage in a cluster of
identical nodes. It can be used for hosting raw block devices (like Amazon
EBS) or object storage over http (like S3). It works like luwak - objects
are chunked into smaller pieces and replicated around the
cluster independently.

&gt; &gt; OpenStack Storage a.k.a. Swift is what Rackspace uses to provide its
&gt; &gt; Cloud Files service, which is comparable to S3. It is in use in many
&gt; &gt; other organisations and service providers as well.

&gt; Oh, and it has an S3-compatible frontend as well. I've never used
&gt; that, though, so I can't say much about it.
