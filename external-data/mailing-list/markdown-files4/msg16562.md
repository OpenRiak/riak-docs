Hello,

I am using a strongly consistent bucket type. I need to simulate instances 
where a process can crash and recover. When a crash occurs, I cleanly 
disconnect and destroy the memory (through a signal handler). 

Sometimes, when process recovery occurs, performing a get on an object is 
successful, however a subsequent set with the Vector Clock from the previous 
get results in the error “Cannot send another request while one is in 
progress”. I found the error in riak\_api project, file riak\_api\_pb\_server.erl, 
but don’t really understand why the error gets thrown. Would someone be able to 
instruct me as to the cause of the error? I am using the current riak version 
from the main repository.
