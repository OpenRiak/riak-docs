Hi,

I tried to query my document using wildcard in the middle of a term through
solr web interface through this address: curl "
http://localhost:8098/solr/test-pages/select?q=title:M\*in"

It does not return any result:

xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?


0
0

on
0
title:M\*in
or
value
standard
1.1
0







However adding the wildcard at the end works: curl "
http://localhost:8098/solr/test-pages/select?q=title:Main\*"

xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?


0
3

on
0
title:Main\*
or
value
standard
1.1
1

Can you please advise what I am doing wrong or anything else that I need to
configure here? I am using Riak search 0.14 with Erlang R14B.

Thank you very much for your assistance.


Kind regards,
Joshua.
