&gt; The Dynamo paper lists heterogeneity as a key principle of the design.
&gt; 
&gt; From the paper:
&gt; 
&gt; "Heterogeneity: The system needs to be able to exploit heterogeneity in the 
&gt; infrastructure it runs on. e.g. the work distribution must be proportional to 
&gt; the capabilities of the individual servers. This is essential in adding new 
&gt; nodes with higher capacity without having to upgrade all hosts at once."
&gt; 
&gt; In the Dynamo design, the number of vnodes per physical node can be tweaked 
&gt; to satisfy the heterogeneity principle.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any way to do something similar with Riak? All documentation that I 
&gt; have found states that the number of vnodes is divided equally amongst all 
&gt; nodes, so I am hopeful that there is some other available mechanism.
&gt;
