What's the map phase function?

&gt; Hi everyone. Hope you're doing well. Tried this on the IRC channel, but I
&gt; guess it was dinner time. :)
&gt;
&gt; I have a query which, up until today, has worked quite well. The data
&gt; currently coming out of the map phases are all correct looking, but the
&gt; minute I start a reduce, I get [] as the result.
&gt;
&gt; Currently, for debug, my only reduce function looks like this:
&gt; function(values) {
&gt; return values
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; If I remove all the reduce phases, I get, say, 2 items out of the query.
&gt; But if I put that reduce function in, I get only [].
&gt;
&gt; Is this something anyone has seen before? How should I go about debugging
&gt; it?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any direction you can give.
&gt;
