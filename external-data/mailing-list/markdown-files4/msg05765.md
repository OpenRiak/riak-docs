Hi Dan,

Yes, I use non-default name parameter and reip it.

Please find my setting and setup info as below:

Version: 1.0.2, .deb
Linux: Unbuntu 10.4, 64bits
Vnode: I didn't specify the other 2 nodes specifically, just used
default setting and did riak start.
The DB has a bumping due to insufficient file descriptor and got
resolved after I set ulimit and sysctl for system-wide parameters.
It ran ok for several days but since yesterday, it gave us the error
message regarding insufficient vnodes errors.

I'm trying to setup 2 additional nodes by copying and modding
necessary files (e.g. /usr/sbin/riak to /usr/sbin/riakN) manually now.
But they each become a single cluster with just a single member in it
and doesn't allow other vnodes to join.
When I launch "riak-admin", it shows something like " ... 100% ...
riak@MY-IP-ADDRESS"


Thanks,
Walter

&gt; Hi Walter,
&gt; Have you made any changes to your configuration recently such as changing
&gt; the "-name" parameter in vm.args?
&gt; Thanks,

&gt;&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We just saw many errors like this:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2011-11-27 23:02:01.129 [error] &lt;0.700.0&gt; webmachine error:
&gt;&gt; path="/buckets/.. (SKIPPED).....ui"
&gt;&gt; {error,{error,insufficient\_vnodes\_available}}
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The DB went well for several days, but now our riak cannot be
&gt;&gt; connected from our code since the errors appear.
&gt;&gt; Does anyone know how to resolve the issue?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Walter
