Hi, Morgan.

&gt; 1 - Are Link walking in Erlang fast & easy ?

Link-walking in the Erlang client is provided via the MapReduce
interface. Instead of a 'map' or 'reduce' phase, specify a 'link'
phase like:

 {link, Bucket, Tag, Keep}

Bucket is either a binary name of a bucket to match, or the atom '\_',
which matches any bucket. Tag is either a binary tag to match, or the
atom '\_', which matches any tag. Keep is a boolean with the same
meaning as in map and reduce phases.

&gt; 2 - Is it possible to check fast if A -&gt; B -&gt; A (still in Erlang)? ('-&gt;' 
&gt; represents Links)

The fastest way to do this is to fetch both A and B and look through
the links they contain.

HTH,
Bryan
