Hi Roman,

Which "process management system" are you using? I have successfully run
Riak using monit and the fact that Riak runs in the background does not
cause issues.

For instance, this monit configuration will start/stop Riak as well as
monitor it. You must disable your system's init script for Riak if you want
monit to do the job instead.

check process riak
 with pidfile /var/run/riak/riak.pid
 start program = "/etc/init.d/riak start" with timeout 30 seconds
 stop program = "/etc/init.d/riak stop" with timeout 60 seconds
 alert riak-ale...@domain.com
 on { connection, timeout }
 with mail-format {
 subject: [ALERT] $HOST: Riak Service - $EVENT
 message: $DATE
Problem:
$HOST: Riak raised the following event: $EVENT
$DESCRIPTION
 }
 with reminder on 10 cycles
 if failed (url http://localhost:8098/ping and content == '^OK$')
 with timeout 15 seconds
 for 2 times within 5 cycles
 then alert
 if 3 restarts within 5 cycles then alert
 group riak

&gt; Thanks, but i meant to run as foreground hidden process, without console.
&gt;
&gt; I need to run riak kv under specific process management system which
&gt; controls process live cycle. It cant do it if the process is backgrounded.
&gt;
&gt; I really dont want ti hack the riak runner wrapper so though maybe there
&gt; us sine trick.
&gt;
&gt; But in any case, it seems surprising that this option is missing as a
&gt; standard

&gt; Hi Roman --
&gt;
&gt; If riak is not currently running:
&gt;
&gt; bin/riak console
&gt;
&gt; If riak is currently running:
&gt;
&gt; bin/riak attach
&gt;

&gt;&gt; hello,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; is there any way to start RIAK\_KV as a foreground process instead of as a
&gt;&gt; demon process, which is what "bin/riak start‚Äù does?
