Hi,

On our presentation of how Temetra uses Riak on Dublin, we were told 
there was a special index which can list me the keys on a bucket using a 
2i search, if so, does anyone has any code sample using the Java client 
to do that? Something like $[bucket \_name] index?


If so, is there any danger on adopting such undocumented functionality? 
Like LevelDB or Riak core would remove it or deprecate it.


Regards,

Guido.
