Hi Ian,

thanks a lot for the answer. Yes this are all important points to consider.

Have you a suggestion what's could be better. Have a 'small'
ring\_creation\_size and servers with lets say 20 TB / server or a higher
ring\_creation\_size and more servers with only 4 TB / server.

Best regards
Sebastian

&gt; Sebastian,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry I missed this part of your question.
&gt; 
&gt; The time required to rebalance a ring after adding or removing a node depends 
&gt; on a number of factors. These include but are not limited to: size of 
&gt; dataset, ring\_creation\_size, n\_val, number of nodes, network throughput, I/O 
&gt; throughput, and load. Unfortunately, it's impossible to say with much 
&gt; accuracy how long a rebalance will take without accounting for these factors. 
&gt; If you want to get some idea how long it will take, you should perform a 
&gt; benchmark trying to mimic your hypothetical production environment as closely 
&gt; as possible.
