&gt; Hi Denis,
&gt;
&gt; It looks like the raw HTTP driver currently lacks support for delete
&gt; operations. I've added it on this branch if you want to try it:
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/basho/basho\_bench/tree/sbv-add-raw-http-delete
&gt;
&gt; --steve
&gt;

Hi Steve,

Oh, thank you very much, I'll definitely try it on our testing cluster on
Monday and inform you how it's working.

WBR,
 Denis.
