Hi Jeff,

Erlang and Javascript are the only two supported "in process"
languages for map/reduce. Can you explain the process or provide the
python you want to use and perhaps someone on the list could help out
translating it to erlang?

&gt; is there a sample piece of code somewhere that demonstrates this?
