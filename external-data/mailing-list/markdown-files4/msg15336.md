I have Riak 2.0.1 cluster with 5 nodes ( ec2 m3-large ) with elnm in front
sometimes I got spikes up to 10 seconds

I can't say that I have huge load at this time, max 200 requests per
second for all 5 nodes.

Most expensive queries is
\* list by secondary index ( usually returns from 0 to 100 records )
\* and solr queries( max 10 records )

save operations is slowdown sometimes but not so much ( up to 1 sec )

It's slowdown not for specific requests, same one work pretty fast later.

Does it any possibilities to profile|log somehow to determine reason
why this happen?
