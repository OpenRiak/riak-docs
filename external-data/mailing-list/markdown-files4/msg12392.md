&gt; From: Matthew Von-Maszewski 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; You can continue to wait for the compactions to purge old data. If you are 
&gt; running Riak 1.3 or more recent, you can look at the creation date of files 
&gt; in each vnode's sst\_5 subdirectory. Those dates will give you a feel for how 
&gt; often your highest numbered levels receive compactions.

Thanks again Matthew. Just FYI: I don't think a lot of compactions are 
happening at level 5. See this for one vnode:

$ ls -l 0/sst\_5 | cut -c 32-35,39-43 | uniq

Feb 2012
Mar 2012
Apr 2012
May 2012
Jun 2012
Jul 2012
Aug 2012
Sep 2012
Oct 2012

And there is not a single file in a sst\_5 subdir with a 2013 date ($ ls -l 
\*/sst\_5 | grep " 2013 "). As a side note: the sst\_5 subdirectories themselves 
have a Apr 3 2013 date.

Regards,
Timo
