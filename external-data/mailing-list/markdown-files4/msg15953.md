Dear Brian,
Thank you very much for sharing this link. I have been looking for a riak 
client for node.js that is compatible with riak 2.0.
However, having glanced at it I noticed that there was no method to access the 
meta information. This is good for link manipulation, for example. As well in 
order to update an object the meta information could be useful. As a disclaimer 
here, I should mention that I have been using riak-js to access riak 1.4. Now 
I'd like to transition to riak 2.0 and I am looking for the right tools. 

Overall, where can one find more documentation and more concrete examples about 
how to manipulate riak with this client. 
Thanks & regards,
Jose
