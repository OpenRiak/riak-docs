I've been working on a Notification Service based on Dropwizard (
http://dropwizard.io) that uses Riak (very much like Yammer's Streamie
service [1]) that I decided to open source under an Apache 2.0 license if
it would be useful to anyone. I'm still adding functionality (like
roll-ups) and trying to make it a decent example implementation of a solid
Java service written on top of Riak.

Any feedback is welcome!

Thanks.
