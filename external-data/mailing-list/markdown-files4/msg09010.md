Thank you Guido. Yes, a secondary index based on date would be immensely
helpful for me to navigate via date. I will do this. An incremental message
id would be helpful for me to get last 50 messages and so forth. I will use
another db for this. Thanks for all your help.

&gt; Don't overkill it with technology, you could use Riak with a simple 2i
&gt; index (integer index YYYYMMDD for the message date so you can search day by
&gt; day backward), and for the message sequence or identifier you could either
&gt; user ANY SQL database sequence or a UUID generator.

&gt;&gt; Now, each bucket would have conversation between two users or of a room
&gt;&gt; of a site. The conversation rate for (some) rooms is very high, some 20,000
&gt;&gt; - 30,000 messages per hour. We have observed that users usually don't
&gt;&gt; access conversations past one week. So, if a bucket has conversation of 3
&gt;&gt; years, then mostly users would access the recent conversation upto a week
&gt;&gt; or month. Can riak handle this easily? Also, would riak use RAM wisely in
&gt;&gt; this scenario? Would it only keep keys and indexes, corresponding to recent
&gt;&gt; messages per bucket, in RAM?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Leveldb backend should.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Finally, what is the best approach for creating keys in a bucket?
&gt;&gt; Earlier, I was planning to use timestamp (in milliseconds). But in a room
&gt;&gt; there can be multiple messages at the same time. As I understand I cannot
&gt;&gt; have a unique incremental message id per bucket (as riak has write
&gt;&gt; capability in all nodes in a cluster so consistency is not guareented).
&gt;&gt; Please correct me if I am wrong. One other way could be to let riak
&gt;&gt; generate key and I use timestamp as a secondary index. But this seems to be
&gt;&gt; a bad design. Also, what would be the best way to achieve pagination for
&gt;&gt; this use case?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; You could use redis for incremental id's.
