Things should be fine if you choose to kill it or not, epmd will start as 
needed and there isn't a difference in between the versions shipped with 0.13.x 
or 0.12.x.

&gt; I'm running the pre-built binaries for Riak 0.13 (and 0.12 x64, for that

&gt; When I do a "riak stop", there is one process still running. The epmd -daemon 
&gt; process. I have to kill it manually.
&gt; 
&gt; In my testing, I'm starting 0.13, running a test, then shutting it down, 
&gt; starting 0.12 and running another test. If I'm not switching versions, then I 
&gt; just leave it running.
&gt; 
&gt; Will this cause a problem if I restart the server and leave this last process 
&gt; running? What about if I switch from 0.13 to 0.12 (or vice versa)? Will it 
&gt; interfere with anything? Do I even need to kill it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
