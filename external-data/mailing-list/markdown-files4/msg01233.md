Yes, it's only for the keys that the node is responsible for.

&gt; Quick question about Riak's memory footprint: I know that Bitcask

&gt; system? I assume it's the former, but I just want to be sure.

&gt; Basically what I'm trying to figure out is whether we should expect
&gt; better performance from a cluster of N nodes with 2\*M GB of memory
&gt; each, or 2\*N nodes with M GB each.
