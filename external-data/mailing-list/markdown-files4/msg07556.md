It'll be interesting if you can write a filesystem on top of Riak.

That would be a cool project to see on github :P

&gt; Hello Everybody!

&gt; I have read abundantly over the web that Riak is very well suited to store
&gt; and retrieve small binary objects such as images, docs, etc.
&gt;
&gt; In our scenario we are planning to use Riak to store uploads to our portal
&gt; which is a Social Network. Uploads are mostly images with maximum size of 2
&gt; MB and typical size ranges between few KBs to few 100 KBs.
&gt;
&gt; Does this usage pattern fit Riak? What are the caveats if any?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you!
