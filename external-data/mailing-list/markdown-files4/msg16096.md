&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; My proposal[0] for adding Riak as a destination to Syslog-ng was accepted for 
&gt; GSoC2015, so before my coding period begins i.e. 25th May, I wanted to do 
&gt; some ground work and take some feedback from the potential users.
&gt; The proposal[0] contains all the initial implementation details which might 
&gt; require improvement .
&gt; Therefore if some of you could take a look and give me some feedback on it, 
&gt; would help me greatly. 
&gt; Below are a few links to important snippets of the proposal.

Hi Parth,

I’ve only had time to briefly read the overview and the goals. That said, this 
sounds great! I’m happy to assist in any way possible.

I’m a bit concerned with your use of the set embedded in the map. Large 
objects have traditionally been a big problem in Riak due to the use of 
distributed Erlang and head of line blocking. I’m curious if you could 
elaborate on what type of data you will be storing in the set: how big you 
expect each item to be, how big you expect the map to be, and the overall 
layout of data inside of the data structure. I’ve provided some references on 
why these things might be problematic below.

Thanks,
- Chris
