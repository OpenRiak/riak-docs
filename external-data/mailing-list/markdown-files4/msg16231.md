Congrats on the configure running. I will ask around concerning best practices 
and get back to you tomorrow. 

Is your /mnt/slow a remote mount? If so, what details can you share?

&gt; Matthew - I got it to work. Setting the filesystem rights to 777 got it to 
&gt; start. I thought starting Riak as root would allow writing to the filesystem, 
&gt; but I guess not.
&gt; 
&gt; Do most people run riak as an OS user "riak"? What is best practice here?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all your help.

&gt; Odd.
&gt; 
&gt; The tree builds fine, including the lock file, once the config was good:
&gt; 
&gt; /mnt
&gt; ├── fast
&gt; │ └── leveldb
&gt; │ ├── 0
&gt; │ │ ├── CURRENT
&gt; │ │ ├── LOCK
&gt; │ │ ├── LOG
&gt; │ │ ├── MANIFEST-000002
&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_0
&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_1
&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_2
&gt; │ │ └── sst\_3
&gt; │ ├── 1096126227998177188652763624537212264741949407232
&gt; │ │ ├── CURRENT
&gt; │ │ ├── LOCK
&gt; │ │ ├── LOG
&gt; │ │ ├── MANIFEST-000002
&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_0
&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_1
&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_2
&gt; │ │ └── sst\_3
&gt; 
&gt; ├── slow
&gt; │ └── leveldb
&gt; │ ├── 0
&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_4
&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_5
&gt; │ │ └── sst\_6

&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_4
&gt; │ │ ├── sst\_5
&gt; │ │ └── sst\_6
&gt; 
&gt; What, if anything is Riak building in your tree? Again, I had to create the 
&gt; leveldb directory in each path manually. Did a chmod a+rwx on directories 
&gt; fast, slow, fast/leveldb, and slow/leveldb. Then started the code and waited.
&gt; 
&gt; I was getting your LOCK crash before I added the data\_root line to the config.

&gt; 
&gt; P.S. It may be hours before I respond again. Heading to the airport now.

&gt; Also, I am testing as follows: make the changes to riak.conf, start riak as 
&gt; root,wait a few minutes and issue a 'riak ping' as root. Riak usually starts 
&gt; for 10-15 seconds, and then crashes (doesn't respond to the ping anymore)

&gt; Matt - thanks for the support.
&gt; 
&gt; Adding
&gt; leveldb.data\_root=“./leveldb”
&gt; 
&gt; results in
&gt; "IO error: 
&gt; /mnt/fast/./leveldb/91343852333181432387730302044767688728495783936/LOCK: No 
&gt; such file or directory"
&gt; 
&gt; Changing it to 
&gt; leveldb.data\_root=“leveldb”
&gt; 
&gt; results in 
&gt; "IO error:

&gt; such file or directory"}
&gt; 
&gt; Running "riak start" as root has no effect, and I also double checked the 
&gt; directory permissions. I also manually created the leveldb subdirectory. 
&gt; Still get the same results.

&gt; Joe,
&gt; 
&gt; Long story short, I am slowly rebuilding my debug setup. Taking longer than 
&gt; I thought. I suspect, but have not yet verified, that if you add one more 
&gt; line:
&gt; 
&gt; leveldb.data\_root=“./leveldb”
&gt; 
&gt; … your troubles will go away. If you test that before I do, let me know your 
&gt; results. I will get the documentation updated if it works.

&gt; Here you go. Thanks for the help. My riak.conf is mostly stock, except for 
&gt; the LevelDB changes.

&gt; There is a script macro that puts paths together during program start. I 
&gt; will go look at that.
&gt; 
&gt; It would help if you would send your riak.conf file.

&gt; After installing Riak 2.1.1 on a 5 node Centos7 based test cluster, I 
&gt; followed the instructions at 
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/ to attempt 
&gt; to configure a tiered LevelDB backend.
&gt; 
&gt; My /etc/riak/riak.conf:
&gt; 
&gt; storage\_backend = leveldb
&gt; leveldb.tiered = 4
&gt; leveldb.tiered.path.fast = /mnt/fast
&gt; leveldb.tiered.path.slow = /mnt/slow
&gt; 
&gt; Upon start, riak crashes with the following message in the log:
&gt; 
&gt; \*\* 
&gt; {function\_clause,[{riak\_kv\_vnode,terminate,[{bad\_return\_value,{stop,{db\_open,"IO
&gt; error: 
&gt; /mnt/fast//var/lib/riak/leveldb/159851741583067506678528028578343455274867621888/LOCK:

&gt; directory"}}},undefined],[{file,"src/riak\_kv\_vnode.erl"},{line,1155}]},{riak\_core\_vnode,terminate,3,[{file,"src/riak\_core\_vnode.erl"},{line,907}]},{gen\_fsm,terminate,7,[{file,"gen\_fsm.erl"},{line,597}]},{proc\_lib,init\_p\_do\_apply,3,[{file,"proc\_lib.erl"},{line,239}]}]}
&gt; 
&gt; I assume the error is due to riak trying to write to the bogus path:
&gt; 
&gt; /mnt/fast//var/lib/riak/leveldb/159851741583067506678528028578343455274867621888/LOCK
&gt; 
&gt; (bogus due to the double slash above)
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a bug, erroneous documentation, or a configuration problem?? I 
&gt; followed the example as closely as I could.
