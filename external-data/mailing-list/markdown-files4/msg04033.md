Ahh, yeah that seems to be the case. I will have to investigate further
and simply trying to turn off the error\_logger adding

-kernel error\_logger silent

does not seem to turn things off, and invoking

error\_logger:tty(false)

seems to turn off riak\_err logging as well, seems overly complicated
just to redirect all error logging to a file which can be rotated
regularly :(

&gt; The SASL "PROGRESS REPORT" messages are SASL messages and thus are
&gt; written to where the sasl\_error\_logger attributes says to write them.
&gt; Messages from a generic error\_logger:error\_msg/info\_msg/warning\_msg and
&gt; friends aren't SASL messages and thus aren't necessarily written to
&gt; where SASL messages are.
