Hi Sheraz,

The CorrugatedIron client uses .NET 4-specific features. This thread
explains why Unity3D is "stuck" on .NET 2:

http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity3d-in-net-framework-4-0.230746/

At this point in time I would recommend your game server run in an
application server (IIS or windows host) targeting the .NET 2
framework, and have data access in a different process targeting .NET
4.0.

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I recently started using C# CorrugatedIron for Riak communication. I am try
&gt; to write server for a Unity3D game but Unity3D doesn't support (or compile)
&gt; any assembly built in .NET 4.0.
&gt;
&gt; Kindly suggest some solution as CorrugatedIron is currently using .NET 4.0.
