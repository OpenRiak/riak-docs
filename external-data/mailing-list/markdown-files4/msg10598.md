I am doing search based on category field of an object.

Searches with spaces, such as q:'category=Role Playing' return results, but
entries with the & char return nothing, such as q:'Fun & Games'.

I tried escaping the '&' like '/&', and encoding it as %26 in the solr
interface query, but this didn't work.

This char isn't mentioned on the docs as far as I know.

Do I need to reindex all of these entries with %26 in place of the &?
