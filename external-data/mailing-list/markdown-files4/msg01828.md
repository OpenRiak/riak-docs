Riak Recap for Dec 17-19

1) A few questions from Quora that I managed to overlook:

1.1 --&gt; 
http://www.quora.com/Riak/What-is-the-optimal-number-of-Riak-instances-to-run-as-VMs-on-a-single-piece-of-hardware

1.2 ---&gt; 
http://www.quora.com/Riak/For-non-production-environments-what-is-the-usual-practice-with-regard-to-Riak-VMs

2) Jon Brisbin made some enhancements to the Groovy DSL he is working
on for talking to Riak.

Details here ---&gt; http://twitter.com/j\_brisbin/statuses/16903681932787712

3) Basho Hacker Kevin Smith has the beginnings of Jaegermonkey support
in erlang\_js working.

4) Riak was given a non-trivial mention in Marc Seeger's Thesis
entitled "Building Blocks of a Scalable Web Crawler."

Read it here ---&gt;

(Majority of Riak specifics start on pg. 71 but there are mentions
scattered throughout the paper.)

5) There was a quick Q & A in the comments on the Riak Wiki about
reindexing data in Riak Search.
