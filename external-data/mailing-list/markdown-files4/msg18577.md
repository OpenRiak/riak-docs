On Fri, Jan 11, 2019, 14:10 Nicholas Adams  Hi Hank,
&gt; We are looking into bringing new packages onto packagecloud but when this
&gt; will become available is not confirmed. In the meantime, TI Tokyo will
&gt; continue to make new packages available on https://files.tiot.jp/riak/ .
&gt; There are plans underway to make everything a little more transparent but
&gt; we will have to wait a little longer for them to come to fruition.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
&gt;
&gt; Nicholas

&gt;
&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to understand what is the plan for official riak releases and
&gt; where to find packages.
&gt;
&gt; In the 2.2.6 announcement, Nicholas Adams provided
&gt; https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.2/2.2.6/ as the location for binary
&gt; packages. Is this correct? Is there a plan to publish packages on
&gt; packagecloud again?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks and regards,
&gt; Hank
