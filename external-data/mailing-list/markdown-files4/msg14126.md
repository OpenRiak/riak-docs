Hi All,

I'm interested in using Riak for a log aggregation project. These are 
basically apache logs that I would like to correlate together based on 
their session ID's. These session ID's would make sense as the key, but 
its the "value" part of this that confuses me. There will be multiple 
lines within these logs that have the same session ID, thus I will be 
creating siblings. Now, is there a CRDT that will allow me to combine 
all of these siblings into a single value or will I need to write my own 
solution to do so? Any and all pointers are welcomed. Also, if Riak is a 
bad fit for this, please let me know.


Warm regard,
Bryce
