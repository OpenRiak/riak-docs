Subject: Re: Cannot Install Riak
To: Bogunov 


Hello,

Thanks for the help. I made some progress and I got it working using the
1.1.2 build.

But I wanted to try multiple nodes on local machine which requires a build
from source. Now I'm getting more issues.

Please see here:

Thanks for your time. Sorry if I sound moody. This just annoyed me because
I was so excited to play with riak and erlang. ah well - such is life.

&gt; Its possible what you don`t have one of required libraries, it seems you
&gt; are missing something from protobuf requirements, try building from scratch
&gt; manually.
&gt; just cd to protobuff dir and ./configure and make.

&gt; &gt; After pulling down riak from get, I get the following error when running
&gt; make rel:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ./rebar compile generate
&gt; &gt; ==&gt; cluster\_info (compile)
&gt; &gt; ==&gt; lager (compile)
&gt; &gt; ==&gt; poolboy (compile)
&gt; &gt; ==&gt; protobuffs (compile)
&gt; &gt; make: \*\*\* [rel] Error 1
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've had an awful experience getting riak setup. I've wasted two hours
&gt; messing around and it still doesn't work. Please improve the experience for
&gt; other users.
