I'd think that you could use a post-commit hook, detect the operation, and
then modify the "left" and "right" records to maintain the doubly linked
list. The downside would be that you're incurring multiple hits to disk, but
you're already incurring multiple hits to disk with an RDBMS when you modify
a table with indexes so it's not a big deal.

Erik - what do you mean by inexact range searches?

&gt;&gt; Unlike the web, with Riak, we have complete control over what links to

&gt; It is usually easy to build a forward-linking tree structure as you ga, but
&gt; how do you maintain it so as you remove some end/intermediate items you also
&gt; remove the references from the things linking there?
