Alex,

I was mistaken about the bucket search. The documentation is wrong, and the API 
is weirded for backward compatibility reasons. You should be able to search by 
index name this way.

client.fulltext\_search(index, query, \*\*params)

We'll update the docs to match.

Eric

&gt; Hi Sean,
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I opted to follow that pattern on my latest attempt as I see it more 
&gt; clear that the way in the documentation. Still same issue although with Eric 
&gt; we saw it works fine when index and bucket has the same name.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

&gt; Don't use bucket with 2 arguments, use
&gt; client.bucket\_type('futbolistas').bucket('fcb'). This makes your
&gt; intent more clear. The 2-arity version of bucket() was for
&gt; backwards-compatibility.
