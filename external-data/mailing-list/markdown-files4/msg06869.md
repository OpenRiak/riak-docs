Yeah, I read your blog post when it first came out. I liked it.

I appreciate the warning, but practically speaking I'm really just not worried 
about it. It's a test environment on an external VPS that no one knows the info 
for. Demo to the company means show image/content-type load, JSON via browser 
with proper indentation, and Riak Control. SSH isn't going to do that for me.

I'm using public data for the testing. I can blow the whole thing away any 
time. 

Aside from warnings does anyone want to help with the question.

Thanks,
Tim

I can get SSH access over Riak's HTTP and protobufs interfaces in about 
five seconds, and can root a box shortly after that, depending on 
kernel. Please don't do it. Just don't.

&gt;
&gt; this is a "Very Bad" idea. do not expose your riak instance over a public ip 
&gt; address. riak has no internal security mechanism to keep people from doing 
&gt; very bad things to your data, configuration, etc.

&gt;&gt; Hello all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have a few questions on networking configs for riak.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have both a public ip and a private ip for each riak node. I want Riak to 
&gt;&gt; communicate over the private ip addresses to take advantage of free 
&gt;&gt; bandwidth, but I would also like the option to interface with riak using the 
&gt;&gt; public ip's if need be (i.e. for testing / demo's etc).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm gathering that the way people to this is by setting up app.config to use 
&gt;&gt; ip "0.0.0.0" to listen for all ip's. I'm also gathering vm.args needs to 
&gt;&gt; have a unique name in the cluster so I would need to use the hostname for 
&gt;&gt; the -name option (i.e. r...@www.fake-node-domain-name-1.com).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My hosts file would contain:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
&gt;&gt; x.x.x.x www.fake-node-domain-name-1.com mynode-1
&gt;&gt; ....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; where x.x.x.x is the public ip not the private.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is where I start to get lost.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As it sits, if I attempt to join using the private ip's i will get the 
&gt;&gt; unreachable error - yet I can telnet connect to/from the equivalent nodes.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So I could add a second IP to the hosts file, but since I need to keep the 
&gt;&gt; public one as well, how is that riak is going to use the private ips for 
&gt;&gt; gissip ring, hinted hand-off, ... etc etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There's obviously some networking basics I am missing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any guidance from those of you who have done this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt; Tim
