Hi Allexandre,

A few things to start:

1. Could you share how you are setting up the connections in the Java
client?
2. Are you able to connect to your Riak TS cluster using the HTTP
interface, or riak\_shell ?
3. Are there any log files from your java application?

Thanks,
Alex Moore

&gt; Hi, I'm new to Riak and I'm using the TS version to perform some tests in
&gt; my Java application, running on an Ubuntu 16.04 server, for a college
&gt; project.
&gt; The library I'm using is riak-client-2.1.1, with all of its dependencies.
&gt; But, when I try to connect to the DB to save data, the connection doesn't
&gt; happen, and after a few minutes, the java proccess is closed.
&gt; What could it be? Maybe a problem with the DB settings?
