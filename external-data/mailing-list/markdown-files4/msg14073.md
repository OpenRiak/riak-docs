Hi Allen,

There's no way to abort a cluster operation that is in progress. In
addition, data won't transfer to the node you added until the previous
cluster transition completes.

Is it possible to add disk space to your three running nodes?

&gt; three, but I need four active to cover the usage.
&gt;
&gt; One node left successfully before I became aware of the problem, and disk

&gt; the cluster, but data is not being moved to it.

&gt; Is there any way to 'abort' the cluster leave issued to the node that is
&gt; still trying to leave, or some other way to straighten this out without
&gt; losing (much) data?
