Hi everyone

I just made php\_riak available on PECL, to test it out install it with pecl 
like this.
pecl install riak-alpha

Php\_riak is a protobuff riak client for PHP written in C, it has only been 
tested by myself so far, so it is still in a very early state, but if your 
interested in improving it I hope you will test it out and let me know what you 
think.
