I have a 5 node Riak cluster running on AWS. I noticed that disk usage is
now at 80% for all nodes. I started deleting content but it doesn't appear
to be making much of a dent. If I add a 6th node, will it start receiving
all new content until it has approximately the same usage as the original 5
nodes, or will they also continue to grow? What is the recommended approach
in this situation?
