Hi, David. The clues are here:

&gt; '{"phase":0,"error":"[timeout]","input":"{&lt;&lt;\\"impressions\\"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;\\"0034fad8-8216-4e12-95e9-abcf4af498ca:cid6587015966:agid5748040653:2012112805:SG\\"&gt;&gt;}","type":"forward\_preflist","stack":"[]"}'

The query encountered a timeout error in the first phase. The
'forward\_preflist' type is an unfortunate problem with Riak 1.2, where
a key that was not found (I'm guessing at the meaning of your
"nokeypy" module name) would attempt to use a forwarding mechanism
that would fail if the input list was large enough to fill pipe
processing queues in a preflist:

This issue has been fixed on master, and will be part of the 1.3 release.
