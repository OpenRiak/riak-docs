&gt; 2) Q --- Does riak replicate the bucket information (e.g. list of keys
&gt; inside the bucket)? (from ddmmi via #riak
&gt;
&gt;    A --- It's not replicated, it's gossiped along with ring state.
&gt;
&gt; "Gossiping" in the Riak Glossary ---&gt;
&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Riak+Glossary#RiakGlossary-Gossiping

Just reread the Recap and wanted to articulate something so as not to
confuse anyone...

The bucket properties are gossiped around the cluster. The list of
keys in a bucket is not gossiped but rather generated across the
cluster on-demand.
