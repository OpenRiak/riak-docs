from documentation:

&gt;&gt;Currently, the wildcard must come at the end of the term in both cases,
and must be preceded by a minimum of two characters.
Does it any way to able to search with one char?

I use RiakSearch to search contacts, and should show something for users
when they type one char only
Maybe some combination with proximity search or custom tokenizers?
Also what about riak 2.0? Does it work there?

I have just one idea, create custom index with field first\_letter and put
first char there and when only single char comes to input - I will search
exact q=first\_letter:a
