Hi,

I just added a 4th node in my 0.10.1 + innostore cluster and I am
seeing all kind of timeouts both for retrieving objects and trying to
execute riak-admin status which gives me:

RPC to 'r...@x.x.x' failed: {'EXIT',
 {timeout,
 {gen\_server2,call,
 [riak\_kv\_stat,get\_stats]}}}


Also, the CPU load has seriously increased on the original 3 nodes.
The data rebalancing is quite slow.
I am not seeing anything wrong in the log files.

Is this an indication that something is going wrong?

Thanks,
Colin
