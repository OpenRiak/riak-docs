Hey Tim,

&gt; In general, what's the process for upgrading a ring?

&gt; Do you take nodes out of the ring one at a time, upgrade them, and
&gt; re-add them to the ring, Â or do you build an entirely new ring and
&gt; restore the data from backups?
&gt;
&gt; I imagine this partly depends on how many versions behind you are, and
&gt; the specific changes to the server and storage backends.

We just added a page to the wiki (this very morning, in fact) with
rolling upgrade instructions for Debian, Redhat and Solaris.
