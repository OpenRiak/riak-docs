Yes, it does return the css file.

The way I've setup my cluster is that I am using my private ip address 
(remember I'm using Rackspace Cloud Servers) for my riak\_core-&gt;http setting in 
app.config, and I am using my public ip address for the riak\_core-&gt;https 
setting.

Everything is working ok on the cluster, everything looks ok from riak-admin 
status. I just have the problem with riak control.

Charles,

A quick test... on the command prompt, does the following return the CSS file?

curl -k https://user:pass@localhost:8069/admin/ui/style.css

Note: change the credentials, ip, and port appropriately for your cluster 
setup. I'll look at something else for the URL redirection to the template 
folder - that shouldn't be happening (obviously).

&gt; 
&gt; This is very much the behavior of older browsers not loading the CSS properly 
&gt; and displaying it. IE7, old versions of FireFox, etc. Have you tried Chrome, 
&gt; Safari, a latest FireFox, IE8+, etc?

&gt;&gt; I recently installed a Riak (1.1.1) Cluster on Rackspace Cloud Servers. 
&gt;&gt; Everything seems to be working ok.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I set up the configuration to enable Riak Control. However, I am having a 
&gt;&gt; few issues using it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As soon as I login in it shows me the home page briefly and then it just 
&gt;&gt; displays the following in only text:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Current Snapshot...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Your cluster is healthy.
&gt;&gt; You currently have...
&gt;&gt; 0 Unreachable nodes
&gt;&gt; 0 Nodes marked as 'down'
&gt;&gt; 0 Nodes experiencing low memory
&gt;&gt; Nothing to worry about because Riak is your friend
&gt;&gt; Your cluster has problems.
&gt;&gt; The following nodes are currently unreachable:
&gt;&gt; The following nodes are currently marked as 'down':
&gt;&gt; The following nodes are currently experiencing low memory:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The URL has also changed from https://:8069/admin/ui/index.html to 
&gt;&gt; https://:8069/admin/ui/templates/snapshot.pjax. It's like it's 
&gt;&gt; forcing some kind of redirection and I don't know why.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Kindly assist,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Charles.
