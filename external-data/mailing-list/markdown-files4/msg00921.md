Hi all,

For learning Clojure I started a pet project to communicate Clojure and Erlang 
using JInterface. To test that project I wrote a small and dirty server that 
can run map-reduce queries in Clojure.

I've come up with a very basic proof of concept that is described here:

http://videlalvaro.github.com/2010/08/riak-map-reduce-queries-in-clojure.html

I don't know up to where this will work, If it is performant enough, or if is 
just convenient for Clojure people using riak, etc.

So please take it as it is. There are some TODOs that I mention in that blog 
post that I will try to address in the upcoming days.

If you think this could be useful for your project let me know and share your 
thoughts.

Regards,

Alvaro
