It would seem the order of recreation may be different to that of the original 
ingest. Isn't sorting best performed on the application server side  in order 
to reduce demands on cluster RAM anyway? When you migrated to the new cluster 
did you make any change to the storage configuration ?

&gt; 
&gt; Hello, 
&gt; 
&gt; Recently we migrated our Riak nodes to another network, so we backup the data 
&gt; and then regenerate the ring, all is well, but there is a strange behaviour 
&gt; in a riak search, for example if we execute a query using the 
&gt; riak\_erlang\_client, returns the objects in the order:
&gt; 
&gt; A, B, C
&gt; 
&gt; And then if we execute again the same query the result is:
&gt; 
&gt; B, A, C, 
&gt; 
&gt; So, in other order, do you know what is causing this?, before to change our 
&gt; riak ring to another network, it was working perfectly.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you
