I think I got it :) I should use riak\_object:get\_value

Thanks anyway,

&gt; Hi everyone!
&gt;
&gt; I was learning MapReduce in Riak and encountered some problems.
&gt;
&gt; The map function that received Value wasn't able to process it by
&gt; riakc\_obj:get\_value. I checked the value and found out that it was not
&gt; proper riakc object.
&gt;
&gt; riakc\_obj:new() returns a tuple where first element is riakc\_obj atom. But
&gt; the Value that the map function receives has 'r\_object' atom.
&gt;
&gt; What am I doing wrong? Are there any other built-in functions to process
&gt; the value in a map function?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
