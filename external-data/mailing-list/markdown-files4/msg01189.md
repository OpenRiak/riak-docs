I've found the existing logs(erlang/sasl), was trying to up verbosity
and separately log web requests.

&gt; Logging is enabled by default, it just isn't available from a console as

&gt; logs aren't quite as verbose as the console logging. Is there a problem 
&gt; you're trying to track down?

&gt; &gt; Since "riak-admin logger" has been removed with 0.12 how do you enable
&gt; &gt; logging? I've looked in the obvious places and can't find it. I would
&gt; &gt; also like to log web access so I've added "web\_logdir" directive to the
&gt; &gt; "riak\_core" block in "app.config" but this doesn't seem to do anything.
