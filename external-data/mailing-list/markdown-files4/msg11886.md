G'day!

Nearly every day since upgrading to Riak 1.3.1 I've been seeing the 
following errors on random nodes:


2013-08-05 01:00:05.775 [error] &lt;0.212.0&gt; Supervisor 
riak\_pipe\_fitting\_sup had child undefined started with 
riak\_pipe\_fitting:start\_link() at &lt;0.26698.882&gt; exit with reason noproc 
in context shutdown\_error


2013-08-05 14:14:35.431 [error] &lt;0.709.0&gt; Supervisor 
riak\_kv\_mrc\_sink\_sup had child undefined started with 
riak\_kv\_mrc\_sink:start\_link() at &lt;0.18229.970&gt; exit with reason noproc 
in context shutdown\_error


What do they mean? I suspect I can ignore them as they're very similar 
to the "{sink\_died,normal}" messages that we would occasionally get with 
previous versions. However, if they're not indicative of a problem why 
are they reported as an [error]?


Can someone shed some light on these errors?

Thanks!

Shane.
