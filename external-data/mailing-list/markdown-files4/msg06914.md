Jacques - 

Older client -&gt; newer Riak shouldn't pose any issues. 

Newer client -&gt; older Riak should also be fine with the caveat that any 
attempts to use features that are not present in the older version of Riak will 
of course fail. 

Thanks,
Brian Roach

&gt; What is the client compatibility between the various versions of servers?
&gt; 
&gt; For example, will the latest riak-java-client work against .14, 1.0 and 1.1?
&gt; Will a PB client used during the .14 era work against the 1.0 and 1.1 servers?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
