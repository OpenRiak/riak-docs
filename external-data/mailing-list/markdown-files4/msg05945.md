That is not the case. The new node will be populated by its peers in order to 
fill up its newly-owned vnodes with the appropriate data.

&gt; Just to confirm, you are saying that existing KV and Search data will be

That is indeed what he was saying, yes.

I hope that this clarification is helpful for you.

Best,
