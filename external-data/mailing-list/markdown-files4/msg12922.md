Hi,

I see from your code sample that you are using the HTTP mode. Do you see the 
same issue if you switch to using Protocol Buffers?

Best regards,

Christian

&gt; Hi John and Engel,
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a link to a Dropbox folder with a set of file pairs (the source file 
&gt; and the corrupted version that has taken a round trip via riak):
&gt; https://www.dropbox.com/sh/snfbiqm0jys9u2a/AZPF7\_RcBT
&gt; 
&gt; John, to answer your questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Windows--&gt;Riak--&gt;Ubuntu VM
&gt; When uploading files from windows to riak, then downloading them to the 
&gt; Ubuntu VM, inconsistencies appear also, but always for the same subset of 
&gt; files (if I repeatedly download the same set of files from riak and verify 
&gt; against the source files). This to me indicates that these files were 
&gt; corrupted on the upload from windows to riak.
&gt; 
&gt; Ubuntu VM--&gt;Riak--&gt;Windows
&gt; When uploading the source files from Ubuntu VM (and after having verified 
&gt; that they can be downloaded into the Ubuntu VM again without any problems) 
&gt; and then downloading them to windows, inconsistencies appear. However, these 
&gt; inconsistencies are varying from file to file from each download round. I.e., 
&gt; by downloading a file a few times I eventually get a non-corrupted version. 
&gt; This to me indicates that the files were correctly uploaded to riak from the 
&gt; Ubuntu VM, but are corrupted somewhere in the download flow on the windows 
&gt; machine.
&gt; 
&gt; Ergo: Data appears to be corrupted both when going upstream and when going 
&gt; downstream somewhere inside the stack used by the riak python client on 
&gt; windows 7 64 bit.
&gt; 
&gt; One more observation: I've done some byte for byte comparisons when 
&gt; uploading/downloading, and the error rate appears to be on the order of 0.4 
&gt; ppm.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello there,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; This looks puzzling. Just from looking at the code we haven't found 
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything suspicious. Would you mind posting a pair of those files that 
&gt;&gt;&gt; failed to match somewhere so we can look at the differences?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for reporting this.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fellow Riak users,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've noticed that when I upload binary files with sizes of &gt;~1 MB to Riak 
&gt;&gt;&gt; from my Windows 7 (64 bit) machine, then read the same data back again, 
&gt;&gt;&gt; often it has a few corrupted bytes, while maintining the correct total data 
&gt;&gt;&gt; length.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's the Python script I use to provoke and detect the situation:
&gt;&gt;&gt; https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7376084
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Notice that I included the typical output when running the script at the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; bottom of the gist. As you can see, for that particular run, half of the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; dummy-data files were corrupted. The returned data from Riak has the exact 
&gt;&gt;&gt; same length as the source, but not the exact same content. I've only done 
&gt;&gt;&gt; brief analysis of how the corruptions appear within the files that are 
&gt;&gt;&gt; detected as corrupted, but it looks like it's typically between 1 to 5 
&gt;&gt;&gt; bytes that are altered, evenly distributed within the file.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I get no exceptions or warnings from the Riak Python client. Everything 
&gt;&gt;&gt; appears to be in order.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; So far I've tested this on two different windows machines against two 
&gt;&gt;&gt; different Riak clusters (a five node Amazon cluster with a loadbalancer in 
&gt;&gt;&gt; front, and a local devcluster running inside an Ubuntu 12.04 Virtual 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Machine). The problems appear in all four possible combinations.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; However, if I run the script from within an Ubuntu VM, on one of the said 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Windows machines, against any of the two Riak clusteres, the problems do 
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT appear.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Another observation: If I generate 50 sample files, upload them, then 
&gt;&gt;&gt; repeatedly try to download them over and over again, the script will detect 
&gt;&gt;&gt; corruptions in different files on each repetition of downloading. E.g., on 
&gt;&gt;&gt; round one it might say that file 1,5, and 19 were corrupted, but on round 
&gt;&gt;&gt; two it might say 3, 8 and 19.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is the riak stats-view from the Amazon cluster we're running (that I 
&gt;&gt;&gt; tested the script agains):
&gt;&gt;&gt; https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7376379
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; But as I said, the corruptions appear also when working locally between a 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Win7 machine and a cluster running on a virtual Ubuntu 12.04 machine.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here are my local package versions, running on Python 2.7.5 64 bit on 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Windows 7 64 bit:
&gt;&gt;&gt; protobuf==2.4.1
&gt;&gt;&gt; riak==2.0.1
&gt;&gt;&gt; riak-pb==1.4.1.1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Any ideas? This seems relatively serious, unless it's some kind of brutal 
&gt;&gt;&gt; oversight on my part.
