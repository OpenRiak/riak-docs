This error means one of two things:

1. Riak is already running - check for beam.smp
2. epmd \_thinks\_ Riak is running - check/kill epmd

That should resolve the problem.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone dealt with this error:
&gt;
&gt; "Protocol: ~p: register error:
&gt; ~p~n",["inet\_tcp",{{badmatch,{error,duplicate\_name}}"
&gt;
&gt; http://hastebin.com/wucipobiho  - someone else having the same issue
&gt;
&gt; For some reason and I'm not completely sure of the root cause (something to
&gt; due with epmd is my guess.)
&gt;
&gt; After `riak start` no crash is produced, but any command will see "Node is
&gt; not up"
&gt;
&gt; However, if you run `riak console`, the crash snippet from above is
&gt; produced.
&gt;
&gt; What's the resolution for this? Even kill -9'ing all riak related processes
&gt; don't fix the issue.
&gt;
&gt; Even weirder is after a long while the issue goes away (or so I've seen on
&gt; my staging environment)
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
