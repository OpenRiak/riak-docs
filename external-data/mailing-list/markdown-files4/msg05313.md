Hi list,

We're evaluating the riak search to see whether we can replace our solr cluster 
with riak search. I'm wondering whether it's possible to update only specified 
field for a given document.

Here is the use case. For each document, we have a field called "users" which 
is a whitespace separated list of integer user ids. The doc might look like 
this:

 {
 doc\_id: 182,
 title: 'Riak search explained',
 url: 'http://basho.com/blog/technical/2011/05/09/Riak-Search-Explained/',
 users: 1 23 32 1998
 }

This enables us to do a global search as well as scoped searches by specifying 
only documents coming out from one or a few users. Like this

 /?q="Riak+search"
 /?q="Riak+search"+users:1
 /?q="Riak+search"+users:1+users:1998

In solr, one has to reindex the whole document everytime a new user needs to be 
added to it. This has brought some unnecessary burden to the indexer for super 
popular documents. 

Now with Riak's search infrastructure, I'm wondering how easy it is to support 
"update only one field"? 

Best,
Alex
