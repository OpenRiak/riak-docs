Hi David,

The riak\_pb repo is structured with current development being done in
the 'develop' branch and then releases being cut from there to master
(with tags). We've switched to a 4 digit versioning and you'' see
sever 2.x.x.x tags.

Off the top of my head, the major changes are messages for Yokozuna
administration, authentication, CRDTs and the bucket type field added
to existing messages.

Thanks,
- Roach

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I watched the Riak Community Hangout #4:
&gt; https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/ctv6lgms873seh3vv0e59nj311o
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for that conversation! From it, I hear that the new (fresh) Riak 2.0
&gt; Java client may be ready soon. That's great!
&gt;
&gt; I want to start experimenting a little and dig in.
&gt;
&gt; What will change, if anything, in the Riak Protobuf definitions in
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\_pb for for Riak 2.0? I didn't see a 2.0 branch
&gt; when I looked.
&gt;
&gt; I'm going to dig in a little and see what happens.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; -David
