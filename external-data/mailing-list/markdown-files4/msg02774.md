&gt; Hi riak-users,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying out the java protocol buffers client, and it works fine. However, 
&gt; it is preventing my process from exiting. When I used the http client from 
&gt; the same spot in code, the process exited, but switching to PBC caused it to 
&gt; hang on exit. Usually this behavior means there is a thread being spawned 
&gt; that is still running in the background. I wonder if there's a way to tell 
&gt; the PBC RiakClient that I'm done with it, and it can close? I don't see 
&gt; anything like that in the available methods.

There is a Timer that shuts down any open and inactive sockets. It will stop if 
you issue a System.exit(0) at the end of your program. I could add an explicit 
"shutdown" method to the protocol buffers client, too.
