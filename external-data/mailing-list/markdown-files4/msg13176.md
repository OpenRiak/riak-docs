The simplest thing to do is to hide your cluster behind HA proxy. That
way you only need to know IP address of HA proxy (or 2 IP addresses
since you might want to spawn two of those as well for high
availability).

&gt; Hi Riak users,

&gt; we are using the Riak Java client and need to support high availability
&gt;
&gt; Currently I am connection the pbc to a specific node in our cluster,
&gt;
&gt; I would like to pass a list of IP's so that in case the connect fails on one
&gt; we will try the operation again on the other node (Also that way the work
&gt; distribution is shared by all the nodes on the cluster)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
