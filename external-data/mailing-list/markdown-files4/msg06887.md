&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My next plan of attack is store a collection of items to a given key,
&gt; approximately 1million keys each with 6000 values.
&gt;
&gt; This sounds cumbersome.
&gt;

Yes, it is true that I will have to deal with a whole bunch of sibling
resolution and merging, but on the plus side, doing
range queries on a collection will be much faster. This is all assuming
that the value sizes don't become so big that
fetching the collection takes a long time.

Can the values be compressed on disk? If so that a 2mb value might not be
insanely terrible.
