Hello,

I'm following the instructions for the Docker-ized riak-cs. The Docker
container runs and (appears) healthy.

I am now testing the install with s3cmd as described in the instructions.
I installed s3cmd and am using this .s3cfg file: (the 2 keys I got from
the running container's log output as instructed)

[default]
access\_key = Q9NKDXZJGAD2CZF3T4B7
host\_base = s3.amazonaws.dev
host\_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3.amazonaws.dev
proxy\_host = localhost
proxy\_port = 8080
secret\_key = 2aR\_IthHHYQpFGx8xP0z46ZyoQUsfzvSsTl4bA==
signature\_v2 = True

When I run a simple command like "s3cmd ls" I get this output:

WARNING: Retrying failed request: / (No status line received - the server
has closed the connection)
WARNING: Waiting 3 sec...
WARNING: Retrying failed request: / (No status line received - the server
has closed the connection)
WARNING: Waiting 6 sec...
^CSee ya!

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
Thanks,
Greg
