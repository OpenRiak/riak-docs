Hi Oleksiy,

Would you mind sharing the output of 'riak-debug' from all nodes? You can
upload the files to a location of your choice and PM me the details. As far
as we are aware we have fixed all previously existing issues that would
prevent a full YZ AAE tree rebuild from succeeding when non-indexable data
was present. However, the logs may still contain hints that may help us to
identify the root cause of your issue.

Many Thanks,

Magnus

&gt; I would like to continue as this seems to me like a serious problem, on a

&gt; And thats a search index that doesn't index, analyse or store ANY of the
&gt; document fields, the schema has only required \_yz\_\* fields and nothing else.
&gt;
&gt; I have tried deleting the search index (with PBC call) and tried expiring
&gt; AAE trees. Nothing helps. I can't get consistent search results from
&gt; Yokozuna.
&gt;
&gt; Please help.

&gt;&gt; Hi Fred,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is production environment but I can delete the index. However this
&gt;&gt; index covers ~3500 buckets and there are probably 10,000,000 keys.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The index was created after the buckets. The schema for the index is just
&gt;&gt; the basic required fields (\_yz\_\*) and nothing else.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm willing to resolve this. When you say to delete chunks\_index, do
&gt;&gt; you mean the simple RpbYokozunaIndexDeleteReq or something else is required?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Oleksiy,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is definitely pointing to an issue either in the coverage plan
&gt;&gt;&gt; (which determines the distributed query you are seeing) or in the data you
&gt;&gt;&gt; have in Solr. I am wondering if it is possible that you have some data in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Solr that is causing the rebuild of the YZ AAE tree to incorrectly
&gt;&gt;&gt; represent what is actually stored in Solr.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; What you did was to manually expire the YZ (Riak Search) AAE trees,
&gt;&gt;&gt; which caused them to rebuild from the entropy data stored in Solr. Another
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing we could try (if you are willing) would be to delete the
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'chunks\_index' data in Solr (as well as the Yokozuna AAE data), and then
&gt;&gt;&gt; let AAE repair the missing data. What Riak will essentially do is compare
&gt;&gt;&gt; the KV hash trees with the YZ hash trees (which will be empty), too that it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is missing in Solr, and add it to Solr, as a result. This would
&gt;&gt;&gt; effectively result in re-indexing all of your data, but we are only talking
&gt;&gt;&gt; about ~30k entries (times 3, presumably, if your n\_val is 3), so that
&gt;&gt;&gt; shouldn't take too much time, I wouldn't think. There is even some
&gt;&gt;&gt; configuration you can use to accelerate this process, if necessary.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that something you would be willing to try? It would result in down
&gt;&gt;&gt; time on query. Is this production data or a test environment?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
