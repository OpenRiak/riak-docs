Hi Toby,

When you create the user, the data is stored in Riak (and is the
authoritative location). The values must match in the config files to
provide credentials used when connecting to various parts of your CS
cluster.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; In Riak CS, the admin key and secret is in the config files for both CS and
&gt; Stanchion.
&gt; Is that the authoritative location for the secrets, or is the
&gt; initially-created admin user the source, and those just have to match?
&gt;
&gt; I tried to figure this out from the source code, but my Erlang really isn't
&gt; up to scratch :(
