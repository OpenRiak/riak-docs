Guido -

When you say "the client is configured to time out" do you mean you're
using PB and you set the SO\_TIMEOUT on the socket via the
PBClientConfig's withRequestTimeoutMillis()?

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Streaming 2i indexes is not timing out, even though the client is configured
&gt; to timeout, this coincidentally is causing the writes to fail (or or the
&gt; opposite?), is there anything elemental that could "lock" (I know the
&gt; locking concept in Erlang is out of the equation so LevelDB?) something in
&gt; Riak while trying to stream a 2i index?
&gt;
&gt; Basically, our cluster copier which runs every two minutes once it gets to
&gt; this state it never exists (no timeout) and our app just starts slow writing
&gt; (over a minute to write a key)
&gt;
&gt; Not sure what's going on.
