I haven't, but that's a good idea. I will get that up in a couple days.

&gt; Hey Jeff, (great name!)
&gt;
&gt; Have you posted the specs for the low cost/power nodes you've built? If
&gt; not, would be interested in doing that? (parts, cost, anything interesting)
&gt;
&gt; I noticed in your Future Steps section (
&gt; http://jeff.jke.net/2011/12/14/future-steps ) that you were looking to
&gt; add an administrative dashboard for things like node status. While I assume
&gt; you'd probably like something custom, have you looked at riak\_control yet?
&gt; It's still being developed, but does a really good job presenting node and
&gt; ring status right now. It's quite pretty too. :)
&gt;
&gt; You can find the riak\_control repo here:
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\_control It's part of the current master of
&gt; riak, so you probably already have it. I've been using it with the
&gt; distributed mud I'm building on top of riak\_core (mostly to learn
&gt; riak\_core), and have found it quite useful.
&gt;
&gt; Going to read through your tutorial more carefully now.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers!
&gt;
&gt; Jeff

&gt;&gt; I spent the Christmas break setting up a Riak cluster and documenting all
&gt;&gt; the steps. I've got a howto/tutorial set up at
&gt;&gt; http://jeff.jke.net/2011/10/02/setting-nosql-cluster that will walk you
&gt;&gt; through the steps.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In particular, I aimed for low cost and low power. Each node in the
&gt;&gt; cluster boots off the network (single point of maintenance for all node OS
&gt;&gt; configuration) and just requires a data drive. Nodes are assigned addresses
&gt;&gt; using DHCP and automatically update vm.args and execute reip if the node
&gt;&gt; address changes from boot to boot. The scripts for this might be handy for
&gt;&gt; anyone else running in an environment where machine addresses change
&gt;&gt; (Amazon, etc).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'd love feedback, and more to the point, I'd like to find someone to
&gt;&gt; walk through it step-by-step and make sure I didn't miss anything.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Oh, and \*thanks\* to the list for helping me with configuration help over
&gt;&gt; the last couple weeks!
