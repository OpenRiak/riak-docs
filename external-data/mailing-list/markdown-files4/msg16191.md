That’s not really an option, I think. Our buckets are named “-YYYY-MM” 
and the keys are user login names. Re-using the date-based buckets wouldn’t 
make much sense in our case.

&gt; Can you recycle the keys rather than deleting them? We mark them as 
&gt; available for deletion and keep a key recycle pool where we pull new keys 
&gt; from.

&gt; Hi list,
&gt; 
&gt; We’re looking for the best way to handle large scale expiration of 
&gt; no-longer-useful data stored in Riak. We asked a while back, and the 
&gt; recommendation was to store the data in time-segmented buckets (bucket per 
&gt; day or per month), query on the current buckets, and use the streaming list 
&gt; keys API to handle slowly deleting the buckets that have aged out.
&gt; 
&gt; Is that still the best approach for doing this kind of task? Or is there a 
&gt; better approach?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
