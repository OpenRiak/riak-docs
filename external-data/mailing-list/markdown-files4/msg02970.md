3) Ripple 0.9.2, a minor bugfix release, is out. Definitely take a
look at these updates if you're using Ripple.

4) Speaking of Ripple, Sean Cribbs added two new contributors to the project.

Congrats to Kyle and Myron!

5) We announced a new webinar a few days ago. This one will take a
look at the Operational side of Riak and should be of particular
interest to anyone who foresees managing a Riak cluster in the near
future.

is happening on 4/27 and will feature Dan Reverri giving an extensive
preso on Riak Search.
