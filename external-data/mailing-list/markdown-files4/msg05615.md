&gt; Alternatively, riak could be more generic and take a function that would

You should already be able to do this, but it requires writting a map
function in Erlang that uses the Erlang Riak client to write back to the KV
store the modified object.

I agree it would be useful to be able to do this from JS. Maybe export an
appropriate Erlang function to store an object into the JS VMs using some
JS binding?
