I have done this for CouchDB but haven't had a need to for Riak, yet.

A couple of links that will help you create a tool to do just this in .NET.

T4 from Microsoft - This will allow you to create your classes from a DB.
It isn't difficult to learn. Here is a post with code that you can use as
your base.
https://sites.google.com/site/mrmbookmarks/msg/t4-generatepocofromalltablesinadatabase

Dapper - This will allow you to query a table and convert it to your POCO
class. Again, this is really easy
http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/

JavaScriptSerializer - Converts your POCO classes to JSON
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer.aspx

WebRequest - Load it in Riak
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequest%28v=vs.71%29.aspx

That should get you everything you need. If you have any issues let me
know. I would be willing to help out and answer any questions.
