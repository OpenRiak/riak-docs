Are there any speed comparisons between riak and Cassandra?

How can I get the Python client?

This page: 
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Client+Libraries#ClientLibraries-Python 
says to look http://hg.basho.com/riak/src/tip/client\_lib/python/riak.py but 
that link returns a 404

I'm guessing there is no C/C++ client since I didn't see one listed.

Is anyone using this thing to store 30,000 500 byte entries/second?
