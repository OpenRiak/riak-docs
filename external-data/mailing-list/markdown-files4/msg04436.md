Has anyone managed to build Riak Search 0.14.2 on OS X? When I try with the 
version from homebrew (or pulling the riak\_search-0.14.2 tag from github) I get 
the following error:

Compiling src/riakclient.proto
WARNING: option deprecated
Config option 'fail\_on\_warning' has been deprecated
in favor of 'warnings\_as\_errors'.
'fail\_on\_warning' will be removed once OTP R14B03 is released.

Compiled src/riakc\_obj.erl
Compiled src/riakc\_pb.erl
src/riakc\_pb\_socket.erl:62: type ip\_address() undefined
make: \*\*\* [compile] Error 1

When I attempt to follow the wiki directions for getting started with the 
pre-built packages, I download a tiny file that's not in a valid .tar.gz format 
and that's all she wrote.

Thoughts? Experiences?
