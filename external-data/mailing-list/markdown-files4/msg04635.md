Good day,

I am exploring the use of Riak for a project that will store some customer
data. I am considering the possibility of segregating customer data by
bucket. Please correct me if I am wrong, but after reading the
documentation and looking at a test system, it appears that by default Riak
will store data from different buckets within the same backend. That it
merely treats the bucket as a prefix to the key and as a index to the per
bucket configuration data. Is this correct?

Looking at the multiple backend example config at
https://help.basho.com/entries/20186031-how-can-i-run-bitcask-and-innostore-on-the-same-clusterit
would appear that even if one enables multi backend support one only
gains the ability to select different backend types, not different backend
instances of the same type storing to different locations. That is unless
there is some parameter that can be passed to the backend definition in the
config file to specify a different directory to store the backend's data.
 Even then it would appear that such instances of the same backend type
would have to be predefined in app.config rather than programmatic created
using the bucket properties API.

Am I wrong?

Cheers,

Elias Levy
