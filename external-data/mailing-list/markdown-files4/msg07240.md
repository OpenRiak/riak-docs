&gt; In a word: screencasts.
&gt;
&gt; Short, easy to digest, 2-5min screencasts on:
&gt;
&gt; -Installation
&gt;
&gt; -Usage via curl
&gt;
&gt; -Step by step walk through of all params in app.conf
&gt;
&gt; -Search. setting up index, querying index via command line. Explanation of
&gt; various analyzers.
&gt;
&gt; -Secondary Index usage. Curl examples.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The whole thing could be done as a series With each cast its own "chapter."
&gt; update the content when something significant changes. Like the changes in
&gt; app.conf in 1.1.x.
&gt;

&gt; Godspeed,

&gt; At this point Riak has been deployed thousands of times. This is excellent,
&gt; but as you can imagine we here at Basho feel this is just the tip of the
&gt; iceberg. We want everyone to be running Riak. The software obviously needs
&gt; to solve enough problems for people to want to deploy it. However, we need
&gt; to get the software into developers' hands before this happens. Â So the
&gt; question is:
&gt;
&gt; What can we be doing better?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not talking so much about features in Riak itself. I'm more interested
&gt; in the other resources, tools, docs, processes, etc., that you think we need
&gt; to put in place or refine to take the Riak community from 1000s of users to
&gt; 100,000s of users. By virtue of being on this list, you've all spent some
&gt; time using or investigating Riak. As such, you're opinions and experiences
&gt; would be very valuable.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments, ideas, or thoughts you had would be great. On or off-list will
&gt; work.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your time. Long live the vnode!
