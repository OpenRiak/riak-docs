That is an interesting use case. The biggest issue I see with it, though, is 
the implication of a permissions system (x-riak-perm-delete) which doesn't 
exist.

All is not sadness, though. You can achieve something very close to this with 
bucket pre/post commit hooks and modifications to your application logic. 
Pre/post commit hooks will be in the very next release of Riak.

For example, let's say you've set a pre-commit hook function on the bucket 
"important" which looks for the custom header "x-riak-myapp-perm-delete". If 
this header is set to false, then the pre-commit hook makes a copy of the 
about-to-be deleted object and stores it in a bucket named important\_deleted 
and then performs the delete. If the header is set to true, then the hook 
allows the delete without making a backup copy.

Now the boss looks for the object and gets a 404. Your application knows to 
check for a backup copy in important\_deleted. Your application finds the backup 
copy and restores it to its rightful place in important.

I need to move the docs for pre/post commit hooks over to the wiki but a 
complete write up exists in the Riak bug tracker here:

&gt; I don' know if this would be worth adding to the http interface or not but 
&gt; might it be useful to have a `soft delete` feature where the http interface

&gt; document has been deleted. Perhaps as an audit trail or even a rollback 
&gt; feature.
&gt; 
&gt; A use case might be
&gt; 
&gt; # currently
&gt; 
&gt; boss
&gt; 
&gt; PUT http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentA { ... } -&gt; docA
&gt; PUT http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentB { ... } -&gt; docB
&gt; 
&gt; intern 
&gt; 
&gt; DELETE http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentA // "Whoops! I 
&gt; think I might have deleted the wrong document! Hope the boss doesn't find 
&gt; out."
&gt; 
&gt; boss 
&gt; 
&gt; GET http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentA // 404 "wtf!? Where 
&gt; did my TPS report go?"
&gt; 
&gt; boss calls up intern --censored--
&gt; 
&gt; # a proposal
&gt; 
&gt; boss 
&gt; 
&gt; PUT http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentA { ... } -&gt; docA
&gt; PUT http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentB { ... } -&gt; docB
&gt; 
&gt; intern
&gt; 
&gt; DELETE http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentA (with new 
&gt; header x-riak-perm-delete=false) // "Whoops! I think I might have deleted the 
&gt; wrong document! Hope the boss doesn't find out"
&gt; 
&gt; boss
&gt; 
&gt; GET http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentA // 410 "silly 
&gt; intern, let's see what else he did"
&gt; 
&gt; GET http://host.com/riak/important { "props": { ..., 
&gt; "deleted\_keys":["someImportantDocumentA"] ] } }
&gt; 
&gt; PUT http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentA (with new header 
&gt; x-riak-revive=true)
&gt; 
&gt; GET http://host.com/riak/important/someImportantDocumentA // 200, "heh, glad 
&gt; I set my `important` bucket's `perm\_delete` property to false"
&gt; 
&gt; GET http://host.com/riak/important { "props": { ..., "deleted\_keys":[], 
&gt; "perm\_delete":false ] } }
&gt; 
&gt; boss calls up intern and says not to worry and makes sure intern gets TSP 
&gt; report, mmm k.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is essentially a 2 new features. 
&gt; \* a deletion audit trail with a bucket's deleted keys ( 
&gt; "deleted\_keys":["foo","bar"] ) and 410 (gone) responses (of course this would 
&gt; probably be turned off by default)
&gt; \* per document rollback/revive feature that allows up to undo/undelete 
&gt; previously soft deleted documents
&gt; 
&gt; What does everyone think? Would this be useful?
