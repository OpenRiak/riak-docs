Evening, Afternoon, Morning to All,

I couldn't let you head into the weekend without a Recap, however
short it may be.

Enjoy!

Riak Recap for Nov. 3 - 4

1) It looks like J. Brisbin is making some great progress on Riak
support in Grails.

Tweets full of awesomeness:

2) danoyoung reported some issues in #riak when he was trying to run
'riak-admin js\_reload' that turned out to be a bug.

If you're seeing errors that looks like this :
http://pastie.org/1269827 then they may be related to
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=862

3) Q --- If I want to filter out the 'not\_found' in my M/R should I do
it in the reduce phase? I have a M/R job that returns what I'm looking
for, but I want to filter our the 'not\_found' entries so that I only
get a list back with the keys. (from danoyoung via #riak)

 A --- There is a built in function for that which ships with Riak.

 Check out "Riak.filterNotFound" here ---&gt;
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/blob/master/priv/mapred\_builtins.js

4) We added Excel59 to the "Who is Using Riak" page on the wiki.
