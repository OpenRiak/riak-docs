Not to hijack your thread or anything, but I just pushed to Github a lager 
backend for sending stuff to AMQP. You could have a subscriber in Java or 
whatever that fed those messages directly into HDFS and wouldn't have to worry 
about Thrift directly in the backend...

Thanks!

&gt; Subject: Lager and Scribe

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I've been thinking about using lager to push logs to our Big Data
&gt; Hadoop backend for later analysis using Scribe. Looking at the
&gt; lager\_syslog backend it looks fairly simple to create such a
&gt; backend. But thrift works kind of different and some implementation
&gt; questions occur when going through the lager code.

&gt; The way thrift works is that you create a connection:
&gt; {ok, Client} = thrift\_client\_util:new()

&gt; then you can use the Client to do subsequent calls like
&gt; {Client2, \_Result} = thrift\_client:call(Client, ...)

&gt; {Client3, \_Result} = thrift\_client:call(Client2, ...)
&gt; [...]

&gt; The problem is that you get a new Client descriptor every time and as
&gt; I've understood it you shouldn't use the same Client twice but
&gt; instead use the new one with each call. One could of course create a
&gt; client and do the call within each handle\_event() and pay that
&gt; penalty hit but there must be a smarter way. I was going through the
&gt; lager\_file\_backend and saw that you use a FD that get's passed
&gt; around, is that a good approach to use something similar for a
&gt; Scribe backend?
