&gt;
&gt; I'm sure there are many good ideas out there re: roadmap and governance.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It's just too great not to be worth deep thought and prudent action.

&gt; Hi Senthilkumar,
&gt; No Riak is not dead. It’s parent company, Basho is dead. And they kept the
&gt; keys. There are numerous forks that are being worked on. Hopefully something
&gt; that is a canonical, community backed fork will emerge. Past mailing list
&gt; posts show strong support from large commercial and govt. organisations.
&gt; Riak is open source and will continue to be critical infrastructure for
&gt; numerous organisation in its niche for some time.
&gt;
&gt; There are also a few support organisations springing up, as well as the
&gt; existing partners (Erlang Solutions, Trifork etc.) If you’re asking me, this
&gt; could be a very good thing for Riak in the medium to long term. It and it’s
&gt; users and community were served very badly by Basho these last couple of
&gt; years. It’s a little trodden under, but no way dead. Give it a little time
&gt; to bounce back.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
&gt; Russell
