Hi John,

None that we have details on (yet), although some have hinted at
running production Riak deployments within Docker containers on Apache
Mesos (potentially across multiple hosts).

We are tracking a similar request here. [0] As of right now, a popular
path forward appears to be cross-host linking via Ambassador
containers. [1] I have yet to prove this out myself.

&gt; Hector Castro has a wonderful project for starting a riak cluster inside
&gt; containers on a single host (https://github.com/hectcastro/docker-riak)
&gt;
&gt; I have been trying to do a similar deployment in EC2, but with each Docker
&gt; container/node deployed to a separate instance. This has not been
&gt; successful. The sticking point I believe is that the name of the riak node
&gt; is not visible outside the instance.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone been able to successfully deploy a Riak cluster using Docker
&gt; images and have those images deployed to different hosts?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance.
