&gt; 
&gt; A quick look at riak\_test it seems that the `return\_body` parameter is 
&gt; generally supported for both HTTP and PB now. I wasn’t aware of that.

I’m not sure into which releases the feature has made it, but bewarned: if it 
works at all, return\_body only works for system indexes: $bucket and $key.
