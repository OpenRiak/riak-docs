Hi Alex, 

Slight confusion in the last response. Just zip up the log files from that 
node and email them directly to me. 

Weâ€™ll take a look.

&gt; Hey Alex,
&gt; 
&gt; The best place to start on troubleshooting behaviors like the one you
&gt; saw is to run `riak-debug`, which is in `/bin`. There's a great deal
&gt; of data in there which you could upload to a Gist [1] and share with
&gt; us.

&gt;&gt; My riak node (i was doing some tests with Riak 2.0.0-1 in Ubuntu having just
&gt;&gt; 1 node) and after some time, out of a sudden started crashing and even if i
&gt;&gt; start it again, it hold running only a few seconds before crashing again.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Then I deleted the AEE folders within "anti\_entropy" and "yz\_anti\_entropy"
&gt;&gt; and is working fine again... I would like to know the reason for that : )
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
