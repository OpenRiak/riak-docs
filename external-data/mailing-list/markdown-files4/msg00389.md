Upgrade your erlang to the latest version. You're gonna have to build 
it from source.

I've been following the directions on this page to start getting a 
feel for Riak to see if I will want to use it for a project of mine. 
I successfully started the Erlang console with the path set to the 
riak client directory, meaning code:which(riakc\_pb\_socket) works 
properly. As does the start\_link part of that tutorial.


However when I enter the following command:

riakc\_pb\_socket:ping(Pid).

I get the following error:

\*\* exception exit: {noproc,{gen\_server,call,[&lt;0.42.0&gt;, 
{req,rpbpingreq}]}}

 in function gen\_server:call/2

I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and Erlang R13B03. Any ideas?

The New Busy is not the too busy. Combine all your e-mail accounts 
with Hotmail. Get busy.
