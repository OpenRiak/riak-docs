Riak Recap for Dec 6 - 7

1) nfo did some work on his fork of Riaktive to make it play better
with JSON data.

Repo here ---&gt; https://github.com/nfo/Riaktive

(Riaktive is an open source GUI for Riak that appeared a few months
back - http://en.8protons.com/riaktive)

2) kotoko and rustyk had a brief convo in #riak about Riak Search Tokenizers.

Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/734186

3) Q --- Where can I look at the js builtins? (from hiredmand)

Here ---&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/blob/master/priv/mapred\_builtins.js

While we are on the topic, the Erlang builtins are here ---&gt;
https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/blob/master/src/riak\_kv\_mapreduce.erl

And there is the MapReduce section of Riak Function Contrib ---&gt;
http://contrib.basho.com/map-reduce-functions.html

4) drev1 and reiddraper\_ had a chat in #riak that started with how
links are set and touched on Riak Search as well as some aspects of
the new MapReduce key filtering functionality that is coming in the
0.14 release. (The key filtering code is in Master for any brave souls
looking to try it out, btw.)

Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/734198

5) This short Riak preso called "Riak in 33 Seconds" came across my
desk a few days ago.

6) Sean Cribbs is asking for ideas on how to implement the new
MapReduce key filtering in the Ripple Driver.

https://gist.github.com/732074 (There is some great discussion
happening there, so jump in if you have any ideas.)

7) Sean also posted the Schema Design Webinar Recap on the Basho Blog.
