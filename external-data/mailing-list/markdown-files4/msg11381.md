Hi Guy, 

When you say nothing starts, can you provide the output of running something 
like 'riak console' so we can try to figure out what is happening?

&gt; The issue I have is, I think, network/IP config related.

&gt; I am totally confused as to HOW each app should be configured. Documentation 
&gt; (eg http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/cookbooks/Basic-Cluster-Setup/) says 
&gt; configure everything with the IP of the machine the app is running on, but 
&gt; when I do that nothing starts. The only way I can configure it to make it 
&gt; start is using 127.0.0.1.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just trying to set up a single node that runs all the apps and is 
&gt; accessible by another machine. It seems a simple use-case but the only 
&gt; documentation I can find doesn't give me any way to make that happen.
&gt; 
&gt; And it's frustrating, because when it fails it gives no useful pointers as to 
&gt; why, and when it looks like it's sorta working, it still fails to work 
&gt; properly and, again, gives no useful clues as to what's wrong or how to fix 
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; Tearing my hair out here.

&gt; &gt; Riak (and Riak CS and Stanchion) all assume some level of competence
&gt; &gt; at Erlang. I found Riak was tricky to get running, but had picked up
&gt; &gt; enough knowledge of Erlang's strange syntax and foibles from working
&gt; &gt; with RabbitMQ.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This assumption is EXACTLY why we publish our own binary packages. You
&gt; &gt; don't need to know Erlang to run Riak, and haven't for years. When you
&gt; &gt; become an advanced user, yes, it is helpful, but it is not strictly
&gt; &gt; necessary. This is especially true of CS, and I'd much rather get the
&gt; &gt; bottom of Guy's problem than quibble about how hard Riak is to use
&gt; &gt; "because Erlang".
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, no, I feel you've misunderstood me slightly. I'm not blaming all
&gt; difficulties upon Erlang - however the way Erlang is used does bring
&gt; some added complexities to the party that can and will confuse people.
&gt; In particular, using Erlang syntax for the configuration file, and
&gt; outputting errors in the same way.
&gt; 
&gt; The configuration format \*is\* hard to understand, and it's easy to break
&gt; it while making what should be simple changes.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a look at a typical error thrown by Riak or Riak CS -- it's an
&gt; extremely dense Erlang stack trace.
&gt; 
&gt; Erlang's clustering requires open networking, or more advanced
&gt; configuration if using host firewall.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Don't misunderstand me -- I kinda like Erlang and have seen some great
&gt; open source products built upon it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We are working on exactly these problems, but they are difficult to get
&gt; &gt; right. Any suggestions on config syntaxes that work well for other
&gt; &gt; products are appreciated. For now we're looking at a format that
&gt; &gt; resembles sysctl.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Another common one is the Apache-style, eg.
