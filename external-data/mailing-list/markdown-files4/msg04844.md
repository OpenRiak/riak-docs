Roland,

You've happen to hit on one of the sore spots of the riakc client. We very
much plan to rectify this but it seems to have eluded us for 1.0. As you
said I think the best alternative is to use the HTTP interface.

As for your final question. Taking a quick peek at the code it looks like
it the setbucketreq simply ignores properties it doesn't understand.

&gt; Hi Basho,
&gt;
&gt; With the Erlang riakc client API I can only set two settings for the
&gt; bucket.
&gt; Why is that? And will it be fixed?
&gt;
&gt; And if you dont plan to fix it - whats your recommendation for creating a
&gt; bucket
&gt; with non standard settings? To use the HTTP interface?
&gt;
&gt; Another question may be why the call riakc\_pb:set\_bucket returns ok when I
&gt; try
&gt; to set last\_write\_wins, which is one of the settings that you cant set.
