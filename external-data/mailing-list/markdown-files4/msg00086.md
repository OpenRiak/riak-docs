Build seems to have went fine but I get a core dump when I start riak.

Slogan: Kernel pid terminated (application\_controller)
({application\_start\_failure,erlang\_js,{{bad\_return\_value,{error,{load\_error,[70,97,105,108,101,100,32,116,111,32,1
System version: Erlang R13B04 (erts-5.7.5) [source] [64-bit] [smp:2:2]
[rq:2] [async-threads:5] [hipe] [kernel-poll:true]

This is on OS X 10.6.

Has anyone pulled off a successful build using R13B04?

The only thing (I see) out of the ordinary is some linker warnings while
compiling erlang\_js:

ld: warning: in
/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/erl\_interface-3.6.5/lib/liberl\_interface.a, file
is not of required architecture
ld: warning: in /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/erl\_interface-3.6.5/lib/libei.a,
file is not of required architecture
ld: warning: in c\_src/system/lib/libjs.a, file is not of required
architecture
ld: warning: in c\_src/system/lib/libnspr4.a, file is not of required
architecture

gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)
