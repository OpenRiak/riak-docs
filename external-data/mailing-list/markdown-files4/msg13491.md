Hi,

What's a good value for transfer limit when re-arranging adding/removing 
nodes?

Or if there is a generic rule of thumb like physical nodes, processors, etc.

Once transfer is completed, is it a good practice to set it back to its 
default value or should the calculated (guessed?) transfer limit stay?


Regards,

Guido.
