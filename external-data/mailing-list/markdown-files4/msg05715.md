&gt; &gt; 4. Does it make more sense to just install a riak package and use the

&gt; &gt; these will live on the same machine.
&gt;
&gt; This is the preferred way to attack this problem. Separation of the
&gt; functionality by O/S processes is appropriate and much easier to
&gt; reason about in error situations. Loopback sockets to the PBs
&gt; interface should be within a 1 ms of total request handling time.
