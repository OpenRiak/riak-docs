Hi Dennis,

It's a bit unclear what you are trying to do here. Are you 1. uploading the 
entire file and saving it to one key with the value being the file? Or are you 
2. parsing the file and storing each row as a register in a map? 

Either of those approaches are not appropriate in Riak KV. For the first case I 
would point you to Riak S2 which is designed to manage large binary object 
storage. You can keep the large file as a single addressable entity and access 
it via Amazon S3 or Swift protocol. For the second case I would consider 
maintaining one key (map) per row in the file and have a register per column in 
the row. Or not use Riak data types (maps, sets, registers, flags and counters) 
and simply keep each row in the file as a KV in Riak either as a raw string or 
as a serialized json string. ETL'ing out of relational databases and into Riak 
is a very common use case and often implemented in the fashion I described. 

As Chris mentioned, soft upper bound on value size should be 1MB. I say soft 
because we won't enforce it although there are settings in the config that can 
be changed to enforce it (default 5MB warning, 50MB reject I believe.) 

Best,
Alexander

&gt; Hi Dennis,
&gt; 
&gt; I am not the most experienced, but what I do know is that a file that size 
&gt; causes a great deal of network chatter because it has to handoff that data to 
&gt; the other nodes in the network and will cause delays in Riak's ability to 
&gt; send and confirm consistency across the ring. Typically we recommend that you 
&gt; try to structure your objects to around 1mb or less to ensure consistent 
&gt; performance. That max object size can vary of course based on your network / 
&gt; server specs and configuration.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this helps.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Iâ€™m using .net RiakClient 2.0 to insert a 44mb delimited file with 139k rows 
&gt;&gt; of data into riak. I switched to a map bucket data type with registers. 
&gt;&gt; It is taking about 3 times longer to insert into this bucket vs non data 
&gt;&gt; typed bucket. Any suggestions?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Dennis
