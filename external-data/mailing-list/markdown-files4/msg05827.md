I keep seeing CRDT inspired frameworks. Here's one I built in Python
that someone may find helpful. It's a bit of a toy but it has good
test coverage for the datatypes I've implemented.

&gt; Riak Recap for November 28 - 30
&gt; ========================
&gt;
&gt; 1) We released some new code that makes it simple for Riak to talk to
&gt; Hadoop. Russell Brown wrote a great blog post all about it.
&gt;
&gt; \* Post (and code) here ---&gt;
&gt; http://basho.com/blog/technical/2011/11/29/Riak-and-Hadoop/
&gt; \*\*\* First three people to get the code working and write [to the list
&gt; | a blog post] about it will get some Riak swag from me. \*\*\*
&gt;
&gt; 2) Basho and Riak are going to have a significant presence in
&gt; Australia over the next few weeks.
&gt;
&gt; \* OJ Reeves, one of the author's of Riak's .NET Client, will be giving
&gt; a talk at Erlang Factory Lite in Brisbin called "Riak: why should you
&gt; care?" Details here ---&gt;
&gt; http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Brisbane2011/speakers/OliverReeves
&gt; \* Basho Architect Steve Vinoski is also talking at Erlang Lite. His
&gt; talk will be all about YAWS. Details here ---&gt;
&gt; http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Brisbane2011/speakers/SteveVinoski
&gt; \* Steve will also be talking at YOW (as part of the track that OJ is
&gt; hosting) all about building distributed systems with Riak Core. (This
&gt; talk might literally be happening right now). tDetails here ---&gt;
&gt; http://yowaustralia.com.au/YOW2011/general/details.html?speakerId=2287
&gt;
&gt; 3) ErlangDC, which is happening this weekend in Washington, DC, is
&gt; sold out. However, if you were able to attend you can expect to see
&gt; the following talks and faces from the Basho Crew.
&gt;
&gt; \* Ryan Zezeski is giving a talk called "From Java to Erlang." (Zezeski
&gt; is an amazing speaker. He is not to be missed.) Details here ---&gt;
&gt; http://erlangdc.com/speakers/ryan\_zezeski/
&gt; \* Rusty Klophaus' talk is called "Everybody Polyglot." Details here

&gt;
&gt; 5) Basho Developer Reid Draper released chunk of code called
&gt; "knockbox", an eventual consistency for toolbox for Clojure (inspired
&gt; by the work the Mochi team with Statebox.)
