The way Erjang is designed goes against some of the core concepts
behind Erlang. For example, Erjang shares messages instead of doing a
full copy like it's done in Erlang (at least, that's how it worked the
last time I checked Erjang). I trust the native Erlang VM a bit more
when it comes to stability and usability because it's developed by
long time Erlang experts. Erjang, on the other hand, was just an
experiment to learn Erlang. Definitely a fun way to do it, but it's
still an experiment :-) It sure is a cool future possibility to play
with.

&gt; During JavaZone last year I spoke with Kresten about Erjang, and he claimed 
&gt; that despite the native code that many Erlang projects use, he was still 
&gt; seeing success using it (the details escape me now) and even did a live 
&gt; benchmark of it outperforming the BeamVM. Crazy stuff indeed.
&gt;
&gt; But either-way, my note was more about "isn't this interesting future 
&gt; possibility" rather than "it would be better than native"... obviously having 
&gt; windows binaries would be awesome and I would actually really like to see 
&gt; that happen :-)
