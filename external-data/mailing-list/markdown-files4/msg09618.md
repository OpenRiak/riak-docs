I have an older version of make:

~/riak-1.2.1&gt; make -v
GNU Make 3.80
Copyright (C) 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.


Should I replace patch in ?= patch by 3.80 ?

else
 PATCH ?= patch

Like this:

else
 PATCH ?= 3.80


Please advise.
Thanks.

That's usually a problem with the make version. What version are you running 
make -v? GNU Make 3.81 (2006) and later will accept multiple else directives. 
If you are on an old system where you can't upgrade Make, you can look at that 
line https://github.com/basho/erlang\_js/blob/1.2/c\_src/Makefile#L12 and just 
hardcode what patch you have on your system.

Hopefully that is your last issue and it builds from here on out. If not, keep 
the questions coming.

First thanks for the quick response.

I followed the steps in "Installation on Closed Networks" section and could 
pass the "Cloning into 'leveldb'..." issue.

But now I am getting this error:

Compiled src/luke\_flow\_sup.erl
==&gt; erlang\_js (compile)
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/u1c332/riak-1.2.1/deps/erlang\_js'

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/u1c332/riak-1.2.1/deps/erlang\_js'
ERROR: Command [compile] failed!

Any suggestion on how to fix this?

Thanks,
Mohamed

Yes, see the "Installation on Closed Networks" section here

Hi,

I am trying to build riak-1.2.1. The make command :~/riak-1.2.1&gt; make gives 
this known error:

==&gt; eleveldb (get-deps)
Cloning into 'leveldb'...
fatal: Unable to find remote helper for 'http'
ERROR: Command ['get-deps'] failed!
make: \*\*\* [deps] Error 1

I saw a resolution on the net saying to do replace git by http:

 get-deps)
 if [ ! -d leveldb ]; then
# git clone git://github.com/basho/leveldb
 git clone http://github.com/basho/leveldb

 (cd leveldb && git checkout $LEVELDB\_VSN)
 fi
 ;;


The problem is that I am behind a firewall.
Is there another solution where I can download some code from basho site into 
some directory in my machine to avoid the firewall issue?

Thanks,
Mohamed
