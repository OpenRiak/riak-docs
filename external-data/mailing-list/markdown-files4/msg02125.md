Riak Recap for Jan. 24 - 25

1) For anyone in or around San Francisco, Stackmob
(http://www.stackmob.com/) is hiring developers with Riak experience.
Bonus points if you're up on MongoDB, Cassandra or other NoSQL
databases. From the job post:

"We are looking for highly skilled and passionate engineers who share
our drive for making a large impact in the Mobile space. We want
people who love using cutting edge technologies to build products and
services that are truly game changers and not afraid of tackling
challenging technical problems."

\* More details here ---&gt; http://bit.ly/stackmobjobs

2) Riak got a write up in programmazione.it (This one is in Italian.)

\* Post here ---&gt;http://programmazione.it/index.php?entity=eitem&idItem=46317

3) Jaspersoft announced native support for RIak (and various other
NoSQL DBs.). If you're looking to extend Riak's BI reporting ability,
you'll want to check this out.

\* Press release here ---&gt; http://www.jaspersoft.com/announcing-bigdata
\* Actual Code here ---&gt;
http://jasperforge.org/plugins/esp\_frs/file.php?fileid=87&id=121&group\_id=428&relid=61&browse\_file=y

4) John Nunemaker (@jnunemaker) is working on something called "adapter-riak"

\* GitHub repo here --&gt; https://github.com/jnunemaker/adapter-riak

5) Sean Cribbs just added a good chunk of content to the Riak Wiki
about Open File Handles.

\* There is content in various places, but the bulk of it is here ---&gt;
http://wiki.basho.com/Open-Files-Limit.html

6) Q --- What's normally used for X-Riak-ClientId in applications?
(from ricardoG via #riak)

 A --- The clientID is used as the Actor Id in the vector clock,
so this needs to be unique across any two clients that could be
modifying the same object concurrently. The Riak drivers should handle
supplying this for you. You can tweak it, but be careful. Keep in mind
that Riak will truncate it to 32bit and encode as a binary.

7) ericmoritz\0 and jmeredith had a quick exchange in #riak about
bucket properties and how to best think about allow\_mult and
last\_write\_wins.

\* Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/797582

8) This is your last reminder about the Riak meetup happening tomorrow
night in San Francisco.
