Already discussed on Slack but just to be public:

I’m in favour of keeping the repositories around but not including them as Riak 
dependencies or supporting them going forward.

Any others ?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; It looks like we’re moving toward shipping the open source repl code with the 
&gt; next release of Riak.
&gt; 
&gt; I’m canvassing for opinions about the riak\_snmp and riak\_jmx portions of the 
&gt; enterprise code. Is there anyone out there that depends on these features? 
&gt; I’d like to deprecate them in the next release, and remove them in the 
&gt; release following that.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
