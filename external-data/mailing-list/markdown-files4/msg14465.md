Hi Andrew,
Thanks for the details.
The Puppet config should never have let it be setup with
allow\_mult=false, but as this is a test cluster, it's possible
something went awry there at some point.

If it's not really a bug that needs reporting then I can let it go.
Thanks,,
Toby

&gt; Hi Toby,

&gt; We've seen this scenario before. It occurs because riak-cs stores bucket
&gt; information in 2 places on disk:
&gt; 1) Inside the user record (for bucket permissions)
&gt; 2) Inside a global list of buckets, since each bucket must be unique
&gt;
&gt; What has happened most likely is that the bucket is no longer stored for the
&gt; given user, but still in the global list of bucket. It shows up in bucket
&gt; lists, but the current user doesn't have permission to actually do anything
&gt; with it. Essentially you have partially written (or partially deleted) data.
&gt; I believe the only time we saw this was when Riak was configured with
&gt; {allow\_mult, false} which is an invalid setting when used with riak-cs.
&gt; Riak-cs uses siblings intelligently to merge conflicting data, and without
&gt; that it's possible to end up in these types of scenarios. Later versions of
&gt; riak-cs should refuse to run with {allow\_mult, false}. I'd check your riak
&gt; config to see if that is the case here.
&gt;
&gt; We actually have scripts to detect and remove the bad buckets that we've
&gt; used in support. We can probably get you a copy if you want. Just let me
&gt; know. And make sure when running in production that allow\_mult = true.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; At some point we've managed to create a couple of buckets that don't
&gt;&gt; work and can't be deleted (in a development/testing cluster, not
&gt;&gt; production).
&gt;&gt; They show up with both 's3cmd ls' or by querying the HTTP API for a
&gt;&gt; user's buckets.
&gt;&gt; However attempting to list files in the bucket, or removing the
&gt;&gt; bucket, or recreating the bucket, fails.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's not in a production cluster so it's not a huge concern to me, but
&gt;&gt; thought I'd report the bug here in case it's of interest to you.
&gt;&gt; Riak 1.4.9-1 and Riak-CS 1.4.5-1 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
