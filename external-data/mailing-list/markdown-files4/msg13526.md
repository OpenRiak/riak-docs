&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; We are using Riak Java client 1.4.x and we want to copy all counters from 
&gt; cluster A to cluster B (all counters will be stored on a single to very few 
&gt; buckets), if I list the keys using special 2i bucket index and then treat 
&gt; each key as IRiakObject, will that be enough to copy counters, or will 
&gt; counter siblings stop me from doing that?

There shouldn’t ever be a sibling in a counter object, so that \_should\_ work.

However, since you've mentioned copying from cluster to cluster, expect a sales 
call any minute…to preempt that, let me tell you about a wonderful piece of 
software we sell at Basho that could solve this very problem for 
you…http://basho.com/riak-enterprise/

&gt; Since at Riak Java client CounterObject is not an IRiakObject, it is instead 
&gt; an operation.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments at a working method:
&gt; 
&gt; Source bucket: Bucket from Riak client pointing to source cluster.
&gt; Dest bucket: Bucket from Riak client pointing to dest bucket.
&gt; 
&gt; protected void copyOneItem(final Bucket sourceBucket, final Bucket 
&gt; destBucket, final String key) throws RiakRetryFailedException
&gt; {
&gt; final IRiakObject riakObject=sourceBucket.fetch(key).execute();
&gt; if(riakObject!=null){
&gt; destBucket.store(riakObject).withoutFetch().execute();
&gt; }
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Guido.
