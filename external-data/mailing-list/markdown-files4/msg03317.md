The reason why a custom function is needed is because he wants to sort
on a key in the javascript object. If it was a list of strings,
calling .sort() would be fine. We need a

Riak.reduceSortByField(values, name) {
 return values.sort(function(x,y) {
 if(a[key] == b[key]) return 0;
 return a[key] &gt; b[key] ? 1 : -1;
 });
}

&gt;&gt; You could simply do something like:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; return v['key'].sort()
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Try that out and lemme know if it works as you expect.
&gt;
&gt; I tried it but it didn't work. And I believe sort expects a list like
&gt; [3, 5, 8, 1] but I have an array with json-formatted objects and have
&gt; to inspect each element as described in the link I referred to in my
&gt; OP.
