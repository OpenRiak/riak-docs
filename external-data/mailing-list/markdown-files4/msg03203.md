I used a small hack for this: removed "-name ..." from vm.args and
added "-name riak@`hostname -i`" to riak and riak-admin.

&gt; I was reviewing the Riak Operations webinar, and it was mentioned that the
&gt; preferred vm.args -name for EC2 environments should be "riak@hostname"
&gt; because you don't have to "rename data or do anything weird" like you would
&gt; if your nodes were named "riak@ip.address" (approximately 40:05 in the
&gt; video).
&gt; I was looking for some elaboration on this tip, namely:
&gt;
&gt; What is meant byÂ "rename data or do anything weird"
&gt; Is "hostname" in riak@hostname a public DNS host that you configure in your
&gt; DNS to map to the EC2 public hostname (ec2-50-18-...)?
&gt; Does anyone have any best practices around vm.args -name in EC2
&gt; environments?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
