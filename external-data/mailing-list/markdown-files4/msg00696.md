If you add riak\_core and riak\_kv to your app file, then use riak:local\_client() 
to get a client handle, it should work fine. Need to make sure all of the 
modules for riak and your app are available on your path, of course.

&gt; I'm looking for some guidance on embedding riak into my existing OTP

&gt; ported them to my scripts. This doesn't look nearly so easy with riak. Is 
&gt; this possible since riak isn't purely an erlang app? Would you recommend the 
&gt; reverse - embedding my app inside of riak?
