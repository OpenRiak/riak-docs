&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I am setting up a new cluster. I followed all the setup instructions (I
&gt; think). I created admin user as doc says, then updated riak-cs.conf and
&gt; stanchion.conf with generated keys. I get the following when starting:
&gt;
&gt; 2016-05-05 01:15:01.167 [error]
&gt;&gt; &lt;0.149.0&gt;@riak\_cs\_app:fetch\_and\_cache\_admin\_creds:96 Couldn't get admin
&gt;&gt; user (LMTLWU8QZ\_UZZJ4Y541) record: {error,notfound}
&gt;&gt; 2016-05-05 01:15:01.199 [error] &lt;0.149.0&gt;@riak\_cs\_app:sanity\_check:129
&gt;&gt; Admin credentials are not properly set: notfound.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If I revert back to default ('admin.key = admin-key'), then it starts OK.
&gt; If I try to create the user again, it says the email already exists. So
&gt; it's there.
&gt;
&gt; I looked at the logs and didn't find anything that seems relevant other
&gt; these entries I just posted. Can someone please help me dig into this issue?
