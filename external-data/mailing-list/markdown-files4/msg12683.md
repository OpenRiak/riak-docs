Greetings,

The default config targets 5 servers and 16 to 32G of RAM. Yes, the app.config 
needs some adjustment to achieve happiness for you:

- change ring\_creation\_size from 64 to 16 (remove the % from the beginning of 
the line)
- add this line before "{data\_root, }" in eleveldb section: 
"{max\_open\_files, 40}," (be sure the comma is at the end of this line).

Good luck,
Matthew

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I installed riak v1.4.2 on ubuntu12.04(64bit, 4G RAM) with apt-get, run it 
&gt; with default app.conf but change the backend to leveldb, and test it with 
&gt; https://github.com/tpjg/goriakpbc . 
&gt; 
&gt; Just keep putting (key, value) to an bucket, the memory always increasing, 
&gt; and in the end it crashed, as it cannot allocate memory. 
&gt; 
&gt; Should i change the configuration or other?
