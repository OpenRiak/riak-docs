Hi Matthew,

Just a quick question. Do you test Riak with memory backend with 130k
objects or just LevelDB?

Regards,
Istvan

&gt; We regularly test Riak and its leveldb backend with 130k objects as part of 
&gt; our performance and qualification tests. Works just fine.
&gt;
&gt; The one thing to remember is that with N=3 redundancy, the bandwidth between 
&gt; the nodes will approach 3 times the incoming user bandwidth. Make sure your 
&gt; network infrastructure is ready between your nodes (servers).
&gt;
&gt; The 130K testing is based upon the loads created by one of our enterprise 
&gt; customers. You can read details of that use case here:

&gt;&gt; Hi List,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm currently evaluating the possibilities to migrate our mysql-based image 
&gt;&gt; storage to something which actually scales and is easier to maintain.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Among different distributed file systems (like ceph, openstack swift) I was 
&gt;&gt; looking at riak as we already have a riak cluster for storing our users 
&gt;&gt; messages.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As we are only storing quite stripped down versions of our users photos, the 
&gt;&gt; average size of the photos is only about 30-40kb, there might be some above 
&gt;&gt; 100KB though. But all are less than 1MB.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As our objects are quite small and I don't need anything besides getting the 
&gt;&gt; binary for a key I want to use riak without riak CS. Is this a good or bad 
&gt;&gt; idea?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The current storage (which needs to be migrated) in MySQL has about 35 
&gt;&gt; million entries which consume 1.1TB of space.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any ideas or suggestions?
&gt;&gt;
