&gt; Hi,
&gt; We are running into a strange issue with Riak Search. Our setup is with 3 
&gt; nodes of Riak (with search enabled) in 3 different ec2 instances behind ELB. 
&gt; App server talks to the cluster through ELB. We are querying for list of 
&gt; objects through \*:\* query instead of list bucket keys and every time the 
&gt; result is different. We have only 4 objects in that bucket / index, only few 
&gt; times it's giving all 4 but ofther it returns 2 or 3.
&gt; 
&gt; This wasn't happening when we have one instance of Riak. Any insight?

Hi Santi,

Can you provide information regarding what versions of Riak you are running?
