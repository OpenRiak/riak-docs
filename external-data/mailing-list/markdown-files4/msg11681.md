Hi All, new Riak'er here so please bear with me.

I have a cluster of 5 nodes, and I have created a cluster-PCB client using
the RiakFactory. My question is the following;

Given a collection of 10,000 items, what is the fastest way of inserting
such items. I have tried the following techniques using the Java API 1.1.0.

- Looping through each item in the collection and performing a
bucket.store(key, val).execute()
- I have also tried using StoreObject with defaults and specifying
'lazy' quorums
 \* I have read StoreObject does a read on every write, if true, can that
be disabled?

Thanks in advance!
