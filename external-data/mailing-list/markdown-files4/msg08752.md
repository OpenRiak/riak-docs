BETS May be a good template for MDB NIFs since the MDB API looks like bdb. It 
doesn't implement the Riak backend API but an ets subset.

Thanks for the tip, I'll look into eleveldb.

 Hi, I'm interested in developing a backend using OpenLDAP's memory-mapped
 database library (MDB). Unfortunately Erlang is not a language I've used
 before. Any tips on where to get started?

 You can find information on MDB here: http://highlandsun.com/hyc/\_\_mdb/
 

 Its read performance is several times faster than anything else out there,
 and scales perfeclty linearly since readers require no locks. Its write
 performance is also quite fast...
