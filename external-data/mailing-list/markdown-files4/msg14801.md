For archiving purposes, running the code in the below link resolved

&gt; I discussed this issue with a colleague and he agrees that running the
&gt; code you found in these release notes should fix this issue:
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.0.2-release/RELEASE-NOTES.org#ownership-handoff-stall
&gt;
&gt; Somehow the final phase of handoff was interrupted and the ring
&gt; changes did not gossip. Let us know if this resolves your issue.
