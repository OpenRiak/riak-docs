Hi Patrick,

I'm glad you figured out the root cause here. You bring up a great
opportunity to improve on error responses too. Please open a GitHub issue
for this and any similar observations so PM can keep track of it.

Thanks,
Matt

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Hi, I'm trying to use node-aws-sdk to set bucket policies but the SDK
&gt; sends the request with the wrong Content-Type, "application/octet-stream".
&gt; I'm not sure if there is something wrong on my side or if AWS S3 also
&gt; supports this since it is its SDK.
&gt;
&gt; To find the problem I was digging in the SDK code because the server
&gt; response is just a 500 Internal Server Error. It could be nice to return at
&gt; least something like "Unaccepted Content-Type in request".
&gt;
