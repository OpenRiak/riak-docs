&gt; Here's something else that is weird. I repeated the steps above on a

&gt; million items into a separate, empty bucket. The numbers now are very
&gt; odd:
&gt;
&gt; \* 4.5 seconds to list all keys.
&gt; \* 6.5 seconds to list + fetch.
&gt; \* 5.1 seconds to run map/reduce query.
&gt;
&gt; Why are operations on the small bucket suddenly worse in the presence
&gt; of a separate, large bucket? Surely the key spaces are completely
&gt; separate? Even listing keys or querying on an \*empty\* bucket is taking
&gt; several seconds in this scenario.

Buckets are "virtual" containers for the purpose of setting NRW defaults.

Riak uses the Bucket+Key for hashing.
