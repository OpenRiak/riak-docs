If you read it thoroughly, he doesn't recommend against using Riak. He 
recommends to start out with a relational database like MySQL or Postgres if 
you don't know what Riak is and how you'd benefit from it, or how you data will 
evolve over time. Start out with one of them, add Riak to the mix later, when 
the need arises. Which I think is not unreasonable suggest, even if he 
recommends to use MySQL and Postgres in a K-V mode. My head spins from storing 
an EAV model in MySQL, but it's been done before and will be done again.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's how I read what he says, at least from the 
somewhat mixed results of the translation.

Cheers, Mathias

&gt; I've read an article of an erlang developper talking about his experience 
&gt; with riak, and I'm a bit afraid on his conclusions because in the final, he 
&gt; recommanded to use sql dtabases in kv-mode instead of riak!!!
