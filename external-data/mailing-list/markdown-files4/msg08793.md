The travis CI build fails occasionally with a map/reduce timeout issue
that isn't due to the client (directly) that still needs addressing.
It's nothing to worry about.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Is there any particular issue with the Java Riak HttpClient when using a
&gt; version other than 4.1.1? I have a pull request that doesn't pass the Travis
&gt; CI build, even though I have verified it shouldn't have issues except for
&gt; the that specific difference, if so, could it be tried with HttpClient
&gt; 4.2.1?
&gt;
&gt; I have tried the integration test on our 4 nodes development cluster but
&gt; never gets as far as in the Travis CI system, so I also wonder if that Riak
&gt; cluster has some extra requirement to run the integration test phase from
&gt; maven.
&gt;
