Or any data from backup? :-)

&gt; Yes, but the same is true if you restore a relational DB from backup :-D

&gt;&gt; Btw, this whole issue is not really Riak specific. It is essentially a
&gt;&gt;&gt; consequence of eventual consistency, where you have to make a trade off
&gt;&gt;&gt; between the amount of bookkeeping information you want to store and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; maximum amount of time (or number of updates) any part of the system can
&gt;&gt;&gt; diverge from the rest of the system before you get undesired results.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The 'eventual consistency' description makes you think the system will
&gt;&gt; eventually fix itself, though. But, won't you have a similar scenario - and
&gt;&gt; even more difficult to fix - where for one reason or another you need to
&gt;&gt; restore a backed up bitcask file that contains items deleted after the time
&gt;&gt; the backup was done?
