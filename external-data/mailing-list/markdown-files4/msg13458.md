Hello Ajit -

 I'm not a Riak Search expert, but running the JSON you included through

&gt; Hi,

&gt; Search doesnâ€™t seem to work on a normal JSON file. Have created index on
&gt; JSON file and installed the search on the bucket also.
&gt;
&gt; $search-cmd search out2\_buk "employee\_name:\"Ajit\""
&gt;
&gt; :: Searching for 'employee\_name:"Ajit"' / '' in out2\_buk...
