Hi Elias,

This is a great time for you to ask, if you’re asking what I think you’re 
asking.

&gt; Does Basho have any plans for implementing a CRDT that maintains the minimum 
&gt; or maximum value for an integer? It would come in handy in our application 
&gt; and it would be very simple to implement.

Do you mean some kind of bounded counter that cannot be incremented beyond (say 
1000), or decremented below a certain bound (i.e. non-negative counter?) If so, 
then the plan is yes, but I’m not sure it is simple. If you have a design for 
such a thing please share it. We’re working with a team from Universidade Nova 
de Lisboa as part of the SyncFree project on this, but I’d love to hear your 
ideas for an implementation. If you want to keep it private feel free to email 
me off list.

Cheers

Russell
