Hi Alex,

I'm on the team that has been adding datatypes to Riak. We considered
sorted sets, but wanted to focus on the bread-and-butter datatypes first. I
suspect we'll look at sorted sets again in a future release.

&gt; Hey I would like some swag! Or schwag, or even some bling! Seriously I
&gt; submitted the survey, but realized later that this is one of the data
&gt; types I would love to see in Riak:

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We'd sincerely appreciate it if you could take some time to complete
&gt; &gt; our \*third\* quarterly Riak and Riak CS community survey. Similar to
&gt; &gt; the last one, all contributors to the survey will be sent Basho swag
&gt; &gt; (if we still owe you swag for the last community survey, we didn't
&gt; &gt; forget about you â€“ it's coming):

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We've gotten some great feedback from past community surveys, so
&gt; &gt; please keep it coming. If you have any questions or concerns, don't
&gt; &gt; hesitate to hit up .
