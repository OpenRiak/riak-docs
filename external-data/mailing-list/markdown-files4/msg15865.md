Sorry, being late. I thought I've replied to you, but it was a very
close one where I think you're hitting the same problem as this:

http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2015-February/016845.html

Riak CS often includes `=' in uploadId of multipart uploads while S3
doesn't (where no specs described in official documents).

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I have just installed riakcs and have the s3cmd and nodejs (the official
&gt; amazon) plugin working.
&gt;
&gt; with the same credentials (accesskey&secret) I CAN upload big files with
&gt; S3CMD but I CANNOT with the AWS/S3 nodejs plugin? (downloading very big
&gt; files is no problem b.t.w.)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; with the nodejs plugin
&gt;
&gt; - until 992k, (I tested with 32 KiB increases) everything works
&gt; - starting at 1024 KiB I get [400 InvalidDigest: The Content-MD5 you
&gt; specified was invalid.]
&gt; - from 8192 KiB and beyond I get [403 AccessDenied] back from riakcs.
&gt;
&gt; this while -again- with s3cmd I am able to upload files of over 1 GiB size
&gt; easily .. same machine, same creds
&gt;
&gt; any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;
