Hi Greg,

I threw together a quick example using a custom function for key and value
generation here:
https://gist.github.com/1553109

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Hi all
&gt;
&gt; My illustrious employer has tasked me with evaluating riak as a
&gt; replacement for our inhouse K, V store.
&gt;
&gt; As part of this evaluation I need to performance test riak, looking around
&gt; I see that basho\_bench appears to be quite a well laid out tool that should
&gt; save me a lot of effort in terms of creating test plans with a traditional
&gt; tool like jmeter.
&gt;
&gt; However we would like to test with our real dataset rather than with
&gt; random data.
&gt;
&gt; As such I have written an erlang module that allows me to expose our seed
&gt; data set as a tuple of {ID, Binary}.
&gt;
&gt; I want to integrate this into basho\_bench in the custom value\_generator
&gt; and key\_generator functions, however the documentation is a little sparse
&gt; and I am struggling to work out what I am expected to return for my
&gt; function in both cases.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any pointers, or better yet, examples of such things.
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks
&gt;
&gt; -- Greg
