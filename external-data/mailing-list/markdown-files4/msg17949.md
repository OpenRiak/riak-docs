Hi Daniel -

I don't have any ideas at this point. Has this scenario happened again?

&gt; There is nothing unusual about the keys. The format is a name + UUID + some
&gt; other random URL-encoded charaters, like most other keys in our cluster.
&gt;
&gt; There are no errors near the time of the incident in any of the logs (the
&gt; last [error] is from over a month before). I see lots of messages like this
&gt; in console.log:

&gt;&gt; Hi Daniel -
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is a strange scenario. I recommend looking at all of the log
&gt;&gt; files for "[error]" or other entries at about the same time as these
&gt;&gt; PUTs or 404 responses.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is there anything unusual about the key being used?

&gt;&gt; &gt; I have a 9-node Riak CS cluster that has been working flawlessly for
&gt;&gt; &gt; about 3
&gt;&gt; &gt; months. The cluster configuration, including backend and bucket
&gt;&gt; &gt; parameters
&gt;&gt; &gt; such as N-value are using default settings. I'm using the S3 API to
&gt;&gt; &gt; communicate with the cluster.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Within the past week I had an issue where two objects were PUT resulting
&gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; a 200 (success) response, but all subsequent GET requests for those two
&gt;&gt; &gt; keys
&gt;&gt; &gt; return status of 404 (not found). Other than the fact that they are now
&gt;&gt; &gt; missing, there was nothing out of the ordinary with these particular to
&gt;&gt; &gt; PUTs. Maybe I'm missing something, but this seems like a scenario that
&gt;&gt; &gt; should never happen. All information included here about PUTs and GETs
&gt;&gt; &gt; comes
&gt;&gt; &gt; from reviewing the CS access logs. Both objects were PUT on the same
&gt;&gt; &gt; node,
&gt;&gt; &gt; however GET requests returning 404 have been observed on all nodes.
&gt;&gt; &gt; There is
&gt;&gt; &gt; plenty of other traffic on the cluster involving GETs and PUTs that are
&gt;&gt; &gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt; failing. I'm unsure of how to troubleshoot further to find out what may
&gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt;&gt; &gt; happened to those objects and why they are now missing. What is the best
&gt;&gt; &gt; approach to figure out why an object that was successfully PUT seems to
&gt;&gt; &gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt; missing?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks!
