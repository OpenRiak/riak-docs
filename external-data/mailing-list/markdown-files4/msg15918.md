&gt; Hi,
&gt; I wondered if anyone has written a stats gathering plugin for Prometheus?
&gt; It doesn't look like it'd be too hard to do; but I'm still lazy enough to 
&gt; hope that someone else has done it first :)

Hi Toby,

I looked around and it doesn’t appear that this exists yet. However, if you 
take up implementing this yourself, we’ll be happy to answer any questions you 
might come up with.
