We keep getting the following error in production: 

@riak\_search\_backend:collect\_info\_response:55 range\_loop timed out!
@riak\_solr\_searcher\_wm:malformed\_request:82 Unable to parse request: 
{timeout,range\_loop}

We don't any feedback as to what the query was that generated the problem, nor 
do we have a consistent repro.

Has anyone else seen this error or can anyone help us with figuring what this 
is and how to prevent it?

Thanks!
