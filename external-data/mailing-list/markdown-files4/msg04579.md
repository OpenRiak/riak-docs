&gt; I just wanted to jump in here and reiterate that patches, issues, and
&gt; opinions about how the python code works/should work are all

&gt; handling issues, pull requests, releases, etc., for the the last few
&gt; months and should be able to do so moving forward. Between them, other
&gt; members of the Basho dev team, and a quickly-growing group of python
&gt; users, we should be able to handle pull requests, issues, and other
&gt; contributions at a pretty good clip.

Thanks, Mark. I figured as much, but wanted to know what \*kinds\* of
changes follow the existing roadmap (if any). If I can submit patches
that improve things for my situation, \*and\* is deemed applicable to
the standard client... then we all win :-)

Cheers,
