Hi,

Can you please send the map-reduce job you tried to run and I would be happy to 
debug it.

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; Once in a few days I got the following error in my Riak cluster:
&gt; 
&gt; 2014-10-25 03:01:23.731 [error] &lt;0.221.0&gt; Supervisor riak\_pipe\_fitting\_sup 
&gt; had child undefined started with riak\_pipe\_fitting:start\_link() at

&gt; or
&gt; 2014-10-25 05:00:09.896 [error] &lt;0.221.0&gt; Supervisor riak\_pipe\_fitting\_sup 
&gt; had child undefined started with riak\_pipe\_fitting:start\_link() at 
&gt; &lt;0.27111.2457&gt; exit with reason noproc in context shutdown\_err
&gt; or
&gt; 
&gt; The client application exits with a connection timeout error when hitting 
&gt; this error.
&gt; 
&gt; Please suggest what does this mean and how to fix it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
