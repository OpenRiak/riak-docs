One thing that is still missing from the docs are the config changes.

We've got quite a few settings in our vm.args for 1.4.x that it's
taken us a while to figure out for our hardware. While some of them
are pretty obvious in the new config (zdbbl for example) other such as
where to put your +S or +sbt settings are not...

&gt; Dear Riak community,
&gt;
&gt; We're excited to bring you our first "public" release of a 2.0 preview since
&gt; the tech preview that we unleashed at RICON West.
&gt;
&gt; The list of changes is too long to trivially enumerate, as effectively all
&gt; of the new features (and some older ones) have been significantly improved,
&gt; but I'll throw out a few highlights:
&gt;
&gt; \* HTTP API for CRDTs
&gt; \* CRDT support for Riak Search (codename Yokozuna)
&gt; \* The schemas for riak.conf (cuttlefish) are frozen
&gt; \* Reduced sibling creation, inspired by the dotted versions vectors research
&gt; from Pregui√ßa, Baquero, et al[1]
&gt; \* Many AAE improvements
&gt; \* Solr 4.6.0 support in Riak Search
&gt; \* You can now use AAE to migrate from legacy Riak search to the new Riak
&gt; Search
&gt;
&gt; You find the links of magical packed goodness on docs.basho.com[2].
&gt; Unfortunately, documentation is still under active development, so please
&gt; feel free to ask questions on the mailing list.
