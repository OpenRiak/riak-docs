Oh yeah, just switching to my branch. I thought you had to patch
something.

&gt; 
&gt; To get all the bash scripts to run I hunted down all the instances of:
&gt; #!/bin/bash
&gt; 
&gt; and made them
&gt; 
&gt; #!/usr/bin/env bash
&gt; 
&gt; I just don't agree with making symlinks on my system. I also think that if
&gt; these scripts could be run with POSIX sh it'd be better to make them
&gt; #!/bin/sh in the long run.

They actually do run under sh (from what I've tested). I think if we're
sure they work even on solaris' sh then we should switch them over,
there's no reason to have a bash dependancy.
