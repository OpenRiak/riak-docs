This commit looks interesting. A lot of changes were made to map reduce in
0.14 so I am not sure it will work in it's current form.

I think we would only need to include the changes in riak\_kv\_mapred\_json.erl
and riak\_kv\_mapred\_query.erl. Within riak\_kv\_mapred\_query.erl we can convert
the function to a {qfun, Fun} phase. Thoughts?

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; I too would find this useful. And a while back I wrote a patch that
&gt; enabled it. I'm afraid the patch has likely suffered bit rot, but the
&gt; ideas can at least be harvested:
