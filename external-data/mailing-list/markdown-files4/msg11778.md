We just upgraded to 1.4 and are having a big problem with some of our larger 2i 
queries. We have a few key queries that takes longer than 60 seconds (usually 
about 110 seconds) to execute, but after going to 1.4 we can't seem to get 
around a 60 second timeout.

I've tried:
curl -H "X-Riak-Timeout: 260000" 
"http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/mybucket/index/test\_bin/myval?x-riak-timeout=260000"
 -i

But I always get
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error

Server Error
======================

The server encountered an error while processing this 
request:  

```
{error,{error,timeout}}
```

Right at the 60 second mark. What can I set to give my secondary index queries 
more time??

This is causing major problems for us :(
