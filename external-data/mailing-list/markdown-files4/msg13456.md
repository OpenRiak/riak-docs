Hi Matt,

We manage all our Riak infrastructure with a couple of Salt states and a
custom module I wrote which you can see here:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt-contrib/blob/master/modules/riak.py

There's another Riak module in Salt core, but last time I checked it had
less functionality. (I talked with them a while back about merging the two
modules - perhaps I should bring that up again).

I can send our Salt states as well, if you're interested :)

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;
&gt; We're implementing salt stack for configuration management, and I've been
&gt; trying out how it works with riak, specifically remote command execution.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone out there in riak-land been successfully integrating it with salt?
&gt;
&gt; I've hit a couple of "arroo?" moments and am curious what others have
&gt; experienced.
