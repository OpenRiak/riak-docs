Issue:

When running searchs against a single dev node cluster, pre-populated
with 1000 keys, bitcask backend, search=on and a /search/svan?q=\*
search URI, the solr response is coming back with three different
resultsets, 330 values, the other 354, the other 345. The range of
keys 0-1000 are split in no obvious pattern between the 3 result
shards..

Anyone have any clue as to what I may have messed up in the config? I
assume this is not expected behaviour.

Other than that, it works great. ;)

Cheers,

John
