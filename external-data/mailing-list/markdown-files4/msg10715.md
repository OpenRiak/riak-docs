That is indeed a bug. I guess you would have seen it in 1.3.0 too, if you 
called the '/stats/ endpoint.

I've opened an issue here https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/issues/528

Thanks for letting us now, I'll get a patch as soon as I can.

Cheers

&gt; Greetings all...
&gt; 
&gt; It appears I've found a small bug in the stats changes introduced in 1.3.1. 
&gt; 
&gt; We don't use protocol buffers at all, but as of 1.3.1 we now see the 
&gt; following filling up console.log:
&gt; 
&gt; 2013-04-05 07:13:05.900 [warning] &lt;0.12654.0&gt;@riak\_core\_stat\_q:log\_error:123 
&gt; Failed to calculate stat {riak\_api,pbc\_connects,active} with 
&gt; exit:{noproc,{gen\_server,call,[riak\_api\_pb\_sup,count\_children,infinity]}}
&gt; 
&gt; The only real problem is that it's spamming the log file, but it's not really 
&gt; a warning - it's expected behaviour...
