Very true. Still I wonder if there's a way to meet peoples expectations
that list\_keys and delete work for buckets way better. Those two things
must be the most requested/commented on things with regard to riak.

&gt; If you think with the multi backend you can come up with many more
&gt; interesting uses for buckets.

&gt; &gt; It seems like every week or so someone asks why list\_keys is slow or why
&gt; &gt; they can't delete a bucket. Is it impossible at this point to make
&gt; buckets
&gt; &gt; their own keyspace or was that the original intention? Sort of confused
&gt; by
&gt; &gt; the entire bucket notion at this point as prefixing my own keys is simple
&gt; &gt; enough.
