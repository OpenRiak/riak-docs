&gt; I would like to know which solr version is bundled with riak 2.0.4

Solr 4.7.0 is the current version:

https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/develop/tools/grab-solr.sh#L21

&gt; and if we
&gt; have the freedom to create our own tokenizers and analyzers and integrate
&gt; them on the solr instances

You can add whatever jar files you'd like to the appropriate place. On
Debian-based distros, the WEB-INF/lib directory for Solr is located
here:

/usr/lib/riak/lib/yokozuna-2.0.0-1-g6ac3a63/priv/solr/solr-webapp/webapp/WEB-INF/lib

&gt; Is it possible to upgrade the Solr instance to a newer version?

There is no way at this time, other than to fork the yokozuna
repository and make/test all the necessary changes and build your own
custom Riak version.

&gt; And how the search itself occurs? We query riak and riak will query each
&gt; solr instance or we query solr and it will query all other solr instances?
&gt; Our main concern is the overall search performance.

Please refer to the documentation:
