Yes, exactly that's what I'm working on. By knowing which sibling is
the oldest and which is the newest it seems like I can usually figure
out how to marge/apply the modifications. Things like Player profiles,
friends lists, etc.

&gt; Are you trying to determine which data modifications to apply from multiple
