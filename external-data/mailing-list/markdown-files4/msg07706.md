Hi Timo,

All your hard work has earned you... a spot on the Riak wiki :)

http://wiki.basho.com/Community-Developed-Libraries-and-Projects.html
(under "Go")

Looking forward to watching it grow. Thanks for contributing.

&gt; For those that are interested I have created (yet another) Go client using
&gt; protobuf for Riak. It can be found here: https://github.com/tpjg/goriakpbc
&gt;
&gt; I realize there are other efforts (like github.com/mrb/riakpbc) and was
&gt; actually hoping Airbrake would open source their client (
&gt; http://blog.airbrake.io/status/planned-airbrake-migration-love-go-love-riak/)
&gt; but can't wait for that.
&gt;
&gt; I have started a library that takes inspiration from the Ruby client
&gt; library (https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client) and plan to implement
&gt; only those functions that I need to port a part of my Ruby on Rails
&gt; application to Go. So far simple get and store operations as well as
&gt; setting some bucket properties are implemented.
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; Timo
