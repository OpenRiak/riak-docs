Thanks, I would check it out for my general knowledge, however I uses
Riak for other purposes and prefer to stay with same backend in whole my
infrastructure (if possible).

&gt; I suggest that you use http://www.couchbase.com/ (ex-membase) instead
&gt; as a cache layer. It's faster but less reliable than riak, which is ok
&gt; for cache layer.

&gt; &gt; Hi all experts,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I want to use Riak for caching and have few questions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) How faster is using memory back-end over bitcask back-end (on SSD)?
&gt; &gt; 2) If throughput satisfying, is there any reason to use more than two
&gt; nodes?
&gt; &gt; 3) When my memory reaches preset limit (lets say 4Gb) what is going to
&gt; &gt; happen
&gt; &gt; on inserting the next element?
&gt; &gt; a) Random element will be dropped.
&gt; &gt; b) Oldest element will be dropped.
&gt; &gt; c) Next element insert will fail.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Pavel
