&gt; Using the sum of the integers of a G-Counter (or a G-Counter built on
&gt; Riakâ€™s set data structure) does not guarantee a globally unique number;
&gt; given these counters are designed (and therefore allowed) to diverge,
&gt; imagine the following scenario, possible due to delays in replication

I played around with using prime numbers to cheat on that a few years ago:

The brisk version is: it's neat-sounding, but the compromises are annoying,
you don't get orderability, and you really want something like Flake
(linked elsewhere in this thread).
