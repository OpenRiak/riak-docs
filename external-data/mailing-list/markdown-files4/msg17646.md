Hi all,

I have a cluster of 5 nodes connected to each other and now I want to use
UFW to deny any external incoming traffic into them but i will allow each
node to access between themselves. Which ports should i open
(pb\_port,http\_port,solr,...)? I connect via pbc but i may need more ports
open i guess.

A configurations like this (assuming is node\_1):

ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow 22 --&gt; SSH (private keys)
ufw allow from  to any port 443 --&gt; HTTPS (API that talks
with Riak locally via Python client)

ufw allow from  to any port 
ufw allow from  to any port 
ufw allow from  to any port 
ufw allow from  to any port 

Thanks!
Alex
