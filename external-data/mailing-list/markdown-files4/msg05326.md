&gt; If you check your Riak log, I bet you'll see an error message, and if
&gt; the final run of a reduce fails, then in Riak 1.0.[0,1] the reduce
&gt; phase sends on its [possibly unreduced] inputs, instead of failing. I
&gt; hope to fix this soon.

Bryan, thanks for your answer. It makes sense now.

This, I'm unable to explain, unless the syntax for calling
&gt; riak\_kv\_mapreduce:reduce\_identity is incorrect in your example (I'm
&gt; unfamiliar with Ripple's API).


It was. It expect an array with module and function for Erlang phases, not
a string with both. Thanks for making me look into this.
