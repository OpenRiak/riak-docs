Hi Greg,

What version of riak did you experience this with? Were the keys being
created and deleted in cycles or were they one off create/deletes?

Cheers,

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I've got my riak ring in a state where streaming keys or curling a bucket
&gt; with ?keys = true returns a whole bunch of keys of deleted objects.
&gt;
&gt; Since this is test data, I'm going to go ahead and blow away the bitcask
&gt; folders and start over, but I'm wondering if anybody could shed some light
&gt; on how I might have gotten into this state and how I can get out.
