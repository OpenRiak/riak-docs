Sorry guys for the delay in response.

To answer dimitry's question
This is what I observed

Actual nodes ping : Works ( I literally mean ping riak1 , ping riak2 ....)
I didnt try riak ping .. But from each Riak node I tried riak-admin
ring-status , this is were I saw the some nodes not reachable.

Example
from riak6(192.168.8.136) I tried the above command and it replied back
saying riak4(192.168.8.134) was not reachable

And the same command from riak4( 192.168.8.134) replied back saying riak6
not reachable.. So I assume the riak ping on those nodes would
have returned with pong reply.

To answer Mark's question .. That was a typo in the mail I gave the actual
ip correctly.
Thanks,
Shrikar

&gt; Hi Shrikar,

&gt; I suspect you've gotten to the bottom of this (as we haven't heard
&gt; from you in a few days), but upon re-reading this I noticed the
&gt; following:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; The following nodes are unreachable: ['riak@192.168.8.134',
&gt; 'riak@192.168.8.135']
&gt;
&gt; electic@riak-6:/var/lib/riak/leveldb$ ping 92.168.8.134
&gt; PING 92.168.8.134 (92.168.8.134) 56(84) bytes of data.
&gt; ^C
&gt; --- 92.168.8.134 ping statistics ---
&gt; 1 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 0ms
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; It looks like you're trying to ping "92.168.8.134", which is different
&gt; from the "192.168.8.134" address above.
&gt;
&gt; That may not solve the issue, but it might not be a bad place to start.
&gt;
&gt; Hope that helps. Let us know if you're still chasing this.

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; We have a 6 node riak cluster running on riak 1.2.1

&gt; &gt; Has anyone faced similar problems like these?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; During this time the latency increases to 1 second or more than that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please let me know if there is a way to get around this problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
