Hi all,

I am trying to connect to Riak using the Node.js library
https://github.com/nlf/riakpbc, however many of my connections are
failing with the error "Connection timeout". Is there a limit on the
number of connections allowed over PB? I looked into tuning pb\_backlog
but it didn't yield any results.

As a comparison, I am able to open many concurrent connections via the
HTTP interface on the same riak cluster.

Is there another protobuf specific configuration that I might be missing?

Cheers,

Alain
