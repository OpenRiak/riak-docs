&gt; Hi List,

&gt; I've got one question regarding the AAE hashtrees located in the
&gt; "anti\_entropy" folder.
&gt; Are these files relevant for a daily Riak backup?
&gt; I assume they're re-generated if they are missing so it should be safe to
&gt; exclude the whole anti\_entropy directory in my backup archive.
&gt; Is this assumption correct or should I include the AAE hashtrees in my daily
&gt; backup run?
&gt;

You are correct. These are not required for your backups.
