Hi Dmitry,

Being able to represent any Erlang term is a good start.

Which leads me to Riak's conflict resolution. Does this part of Riak
understand the data types or does it just present the N alternative
values for a key to the client when there is a conflict?

There is potential for some semi-automated merging to be done
server-side in the case where values have richer semantics. I suspect
that it would depend on the application, and the client would need to
tell Riak it's OK to perform an automatic merge on write.

&gt; Actually, Riak can store all Erlang terms: lists, tuples, numbers,
&gt; binaries, etc.
&gt;
&gt; But if you use, for example, PHP or Python, you can just use your own
&gt; serialization format. So there are no problems here for any other
&gt; languages as well.

&gt;&gt; Hi guys,

&gt;&gt; Is there any plan for supporting more than opaque blobs as values in
&gt;&gt; the future? Â For example, lists, sets, hashes etc, including
&gt;&gt; server-side support for operating on those data-types?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In the meantime, I am curious about the feasibility of putting
&gt;&gt; riak\_core in front of Redis, and supporting a richer API in the layers
&gt;&gt; above (which I suspect would need to be heavily modified to support
&gt;&gt; additional value manipulation functionality).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, is anyone aware of anyone attempting such a project?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt;
