&gt; Most such systems use some variant of primary copy replication, also known as 
&gt; master/slave replication.
&gt;
&gt; That approach can provide consistency, but has much weaker availability 
&gt; properties.

Doesn't riak need some kind of partition owner/master concept to
control migration? And if it has that, why can't the client request
that an operation happens on the partition owner/master first for
things that need consistency?
