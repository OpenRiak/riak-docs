That should work but are you sure you want to expose your riak server to the 
Internet? I would recommend against that and instead suggest your app talk to 
some middleware.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Please excuse me if I am asking a silly question.
&gt; 
&gt; Is the Riak Java Client also usable (applies to) in Android application 
&gt; development?
&gt; 
&gt; That is, if I want to develop an Android app that connects to a Riak Server, 
&gt; do I use this riak-Java-Client?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your reply.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Gustavo.
