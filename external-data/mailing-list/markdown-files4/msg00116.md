Matt,

Good work! We have a couple of comments for you:

1) "heart" is probably not the best way to keep your Riak nodes up - it has a 
tendency to restart nodes that fail fatally, and doesn't behave well when you 
want to shut down a node normally. You might be better off with a traditional 
monitoring tool like "monit" which can back off restarts and notify you when a 
node is flapping.

2) Make sure your configuration, either via editing vm.args or via the 
ERL\_FLAGS environment variable, includes "-smp enable". Innostore won't work 
without it.

&gt; Riakaws is just a simple way to deploy a Riak cluster in the Amazon cloud.
