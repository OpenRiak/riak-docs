Are you using leveldb or bitcask back end? What is your desired data 
directory? I will create an example.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to change /etc/riak/app.config to store data in a directory of my 
&gt; choosing rather than the default one. Simply changing platform\_data\_dir to 
&gt; another directory yields errors, even after a `chown -R riak:riak` of the 
&gt; relevant directory; the service starts but any attempts to use the REST API 
&gt; yield 500 Internal Server Errors. Trying to change other things, such as the 
&gt; ring\_state\_dir, generally results in riak failing to start at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have an example configuration where data is stored in a different 
&gt; directory to the defaults, or advice about where I might be going wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm using a binary install of riak 1.4.8 on CentOS, if that's relevant.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Nabil
