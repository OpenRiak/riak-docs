That's perfect and exactly what I needed. Basically I want to make sure that
write does not happen in case of network partitioning, which PW was made for
I presume.
If PR/PW is defined/set on a bucket, do write and read still care about W
and R settings?
If yes, then I guess for every read, write only following settings are valid
PR&lt;=R and PW&lt;=W ?
