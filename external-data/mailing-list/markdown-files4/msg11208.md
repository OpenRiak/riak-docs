Thanks, Dmitri, that's very kind of you.

I integrated Zukai with another project this weekend, and I'm pleased with
the results. I'm very interested in your experiences, too, so please let
me know what you think if you try the code.

&gt; Wow! Troy, the project looks very impressive. Excellent docs, too. I can't
&gt; wait to try it out.

&gt;&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've put together an ODM [1] for Riak and Node.js. I tried a few of the
&gt;&gt; the available packages, but none were to my liking. I wanted something
&gt;&gt; that used protocol buffers, json schemas, and promises. So I made one.
&gt;&gt; It's here:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/natural/zukai
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Feedback, bug reports, general comments and criticisms are always
&gt;&gt; welcome. Best,
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; [1] I think "ODM" is a little silly and wouldn't the term if there were
&gt;&gt; something better.
