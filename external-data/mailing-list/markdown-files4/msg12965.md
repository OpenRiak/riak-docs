@John, I'm definitely looking forward to CRDT's but at the same time i'm
looking into alternative approaches for achieving the same thing.

@Jason, your description is close to what i had in mind. Only real
difference is merge would be on read. I did some testing and m/r seems to
work by using an initial map phase calling `riak\_object:get\_values`


There's also the addition of maximum number of siblings in riak-2.0[1]

&gt; Jason, I don’t see any inherent problems, given reasonable management of
&gt; the situation as you describe. I’d have to chase the code path to see what
&gt; overhead you’re introducing to Riak’s processing, but if it’s working well
&gt; for you, then who am I to object?
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps someone who’s more familiar with the sibling management code could
&gt; chime in.

&gt; I am currently forcing siblings for time series data. The maximum bucket
&gt; sizes are very predictable due to the nature of the data. I originally used
&gt; the get/update/set cycle, but as I approach the end of the interval,
&gt; reading and writing 1MB+ objects at a high frequency kills network
&gt; bandwidth. So now, I append siblings, and I have a cron that merges the
&gt; previous siblings (a simple set union works for me, only entire objects are
&gt; ever deleted).
&gt;
&gt; I can see how it can be dangerous to insert siblings, bit if you have some
&gt; other method of knowing how much data is in one, I don't see size being an
&gt; issue. I have also considered using a counter to know how large an object
&gt; is without fetching it, which shouldn't be off by more than a few siblings
&gt; unless there is a network partition.
&gt;
&gt; So aside from size issues, which can be roughly predicted or worked
&gt; around, is there any reason to not create hundreds or thousands of siblings
&gt; and resolve them later? I realise sets could work well for my use case, but
&gt; they seem overkill for simple append operations when I don't need delete
&gt; functionality. Creating your own CRDTs are trivial if you never need to
&gt; delete.
&gt;
&gt; Thoughts are welcome,

&gt;
&gt; Forcing siblings other than for testing purposes is not typically a good
&gt; idea; as you indicate, the object size can easily become a problem as all
&gt; siblings will live inside the same Riak value.
&gt;
&gt; Your counter-example sounds a lot like a use case for server-side CRDTs;
&gt; data structures that allow the application to add values without retrieving
&gt; the server-side content first, and siblings are resolved by Riak.
&gt;
&gt; These will arrive with Riak 2.0; see
&gt; https://gist.github.com/russelldb/f92f44bdfb619e089a4d for an overview.

&gt; Do you consider forcing siblings a good idea? I would like to get some
&gt; input on possible use cases and pitfalls.
&gt; For instance i have considered to force siblings and then merge them on
&gt; read instead of fetching an object every time i want to update it
&gt; (especially with larger objects).
&gt;
&gt; It's not clear from the docs if there are any limitations, will the
&gt; maximum object size be the limitation:?
&gt;
&gt; A section of the docs[1] comees comes to mind:
&gt;
&gt; "Having an enormous object in your node can cause reads of that object to
&gt; crash the entire node. Other issues are increased cluster latency as the
&gt; object is replicated and out of memory errors."
