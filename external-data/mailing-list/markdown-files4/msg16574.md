I benchmark riak's performance using basho\_bench in the last days. But 
the performance is unsatisfying.


I have a 2 node cluster, each node running on the same vm(8 CPU, 32 GB 
RAM). Riak's storage\_backend is memory. The total ops could reach 10000 
with the put command. Can I do something to make the performance better ?
