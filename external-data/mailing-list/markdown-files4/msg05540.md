Hi,
&gt; I am trying to install Riak's python client library using Pip. But it throws 
&gt; an IOError while installing: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 
&gt; 'protobuf/setup.py'. Apparently, a lot of guys are facing the same problem. 
&gt; The problem is that the latest version of Protobuf (2.4.1) has moved setup.py 
&gt; from /setup.py to /python/setup.py.
&gt; There is already an issue raised for Riak: 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/issues/19.
&gt; Any suggestions how to specify correct path of setup.py to Pip?

Easiest route is to install protobuf-2.3.0 from Riak's page using easy\_install. 
Pip can't install .eggs.

Or, you can hack around in Google's 2.4.1 to get all the setup paths right.

BTW, are there any plans for the Riak python client to use the protobuf C 
library directly via ctypes? The pure python implementation of protobuf seems a 
little slow.
