Hi,

I am running only one riak instance on a vps for evaluation. This is a
new installation with only 30 keys. The cpu usage is getting higher after
2/3 days of run even if there is no access to the system. My vps was
shutdown for the high cpu usage and here's the detail provided by my vps
provider

318335 110 20 0 2992m 86m 1720 S 192.2 0.3 6484:53 beam.smp

riak version is 1.3.0
OS: Debian 32 bits
RAM : 2 GB

Last time I checked the cpu usage was 180% for beam.smp.

Please help.

Thanks.
Satya
