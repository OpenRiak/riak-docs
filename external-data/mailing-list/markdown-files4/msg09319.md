&gt; Hmm. Thanks for the extensive info. We're looking into this. Give us a few 
&gt; hours to do some theorizing. You'll hear from us tomorrow unless another 
&gt; enterprising list member has thoughts here.
&gt;

Was there any update to this?

We had the exact same issue with one of the nodes in our 35+ node
cluster running 1.2.1. It was grinding the whole cluster to a halt
while it was up. The second it crashed, we went from writing 1k
docs/min to 800k docs/min, cluster-wide. After a force-remove of the
node the cluster recovered nicely, but we never found out what the
problem was. Didn't find any IO/mem/cpu/limits bottlenecks while it
was trying to start up, and no hardware problems during the
post-removal inspection.

Thanks
