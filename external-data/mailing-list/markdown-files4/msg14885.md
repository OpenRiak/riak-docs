Hi Henning,

Running a singleton instance of Riak throws away all of the advantages aims
to provide. If you need a single database server, why not use something
designed for that end and rock solid, like PostgreSQL?

&gt; Is there anything that speaks against doing so? I'm thinking that in

&gt; sense, right? Would you also set the ring-size to 1?
