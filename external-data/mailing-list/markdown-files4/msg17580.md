Anatoly,

The first time series TTL feature is due in Riak TS 1.4. That release is 
looking good for late August.

The 1.4 release establishes a global TTL (also known as expiry policy) for all 
data. A future release will allow individual policies per Riak TS table (yeah, 
I am coding on that now).

You can find some technical details about the feature here:

This feature will also arrive soon in our Riak KV 2.2.x product line.

Matthew

&gt; Hello! 
&gt; 
&gt; Decided to take a look at Riak TS for our monitoring system.
&gt; I went through the docs and wonder if it possible to set TTL for metrics? For 
&gt; example, in KairosDB with Cassandra, I could set TTL, which would cause 
&gt; metric to be marked with a “tombstone” after this time passed and deleted in 
&gt; the next clean-up tier.
&gt; 
&gt; Does Riak TS have similar feature for auto clean-up old time-series data? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
