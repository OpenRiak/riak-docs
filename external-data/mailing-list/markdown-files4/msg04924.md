Bucket+Key gives us the flattened Key for a value
Bucket+Key2 gives us another Key for a different value

While we cannot say "give us all keys in a bucket" because it's flat
and causes a full scan, is there any way to say "give me all matching
buckets" without doing a full scan, or does that still hit the
flattened-key problem?
(eg, there's no Bucket-&gt;Key relationship, but is there a
"system-&gt;bucket" relationship? Match all buckets "foo" for the MR
input.)

If not, when doing MRs, you have to know all of the buckets ahead of
time, else you run into a full scan?
Is this correct?

Thanks!
