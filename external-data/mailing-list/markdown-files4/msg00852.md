&gt; A common patterns for doing this would be to store the document in something 
&gt; like docs/docid and the meta in a derived location such as docs\_meta/docid. 
&gt; You could map reduce the meta in the docs\_meta bucket to get a list of keys 
&gt; that would exist in the docs bucket. Derived locations are a good way to go 
&gt; especially in 1 to 1 relationships. Link walking is another method. Your meta 
&gt; document could store links to other documents in its link headers that would 
&gt; also be retrieved either by a link walking m/r or further down the line after 
&gt; some query style m/r where you filter the metadata itself. Links are 
&gt; unidirectional in Riak.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps. -Alexander

&gt;&gt; As a complete new starter on riak, I wonder if someone could advise on what 
&gt;&gt; is the idiomatic way of using riak in the case of wanting to store a 
&gt;&gt; document together with some associated metadata (and wanting to retrieve the 
&gt;&gt; object based on metadata queries). Application-imposed link from the 
&gt;&gt; 'metadata' document to the key of the 'main' document? A parent child 
&gt;&gt; relationship? Thanks.
