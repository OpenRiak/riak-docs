Hi, thanks for your suggestion, but I would prefer to use the official
packages, and for what I saw on the list some days ago, the new version was
published, so I wonder why is not yet working.

Thanks,
Alex

&gt; Hi Alex,
&gt;
&gt; Use the version from git and see if you get the same error:
&gt;
&gt; git clone https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client.git
&gt; cd riak-python-client
&gt; python setup.py install
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi there,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I created a "counter" bucket called "likes" with the following shell
&gt; &gt; script:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; riak-admin bucket-type create likes '{"props":{"datatype":"counter"}}'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I try to follow the guide [
&gt; &gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/using/data-types ] to use this
&gt; &gt; bucket with Python, I found the following issue:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Traceback (most recent call last):
&gt; &gt; File "x.py", line 17, in 
&gt; &gt; bucket = client.bucket\_type('counter\_bucket').bucket('likes')
&gt; &gt; AttributeError: 'RiakClient' object has no attribute 'bucket\_type'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Something wrong? Is a fresh install from "pip" so I thought the Python
&gt; &gt; library would be in its last updated version?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt; Alex
