Peter,

I see where you hit your problem. In the 'make devrel' step it did try to go 
out to the network to re-clone all of the dependencies. To fix this, simply 
change this line in the Makefile: 
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/riak-1.3.1/Makefile#L79 from

dev% : all riaknostic

to

dev% : riaknostic

Remove the 'dev' directory to make sure everything is clean and try to run 
'make devrel' again.

Let me know how that goes.
A devrel directory didn't seem to get generated - but I unpacked a new source 
tree to be sure.

Unfortunately there was no change.

Make all completed, but make devrel produced the same errors as before.

&gt;Peter,

&gt;For 1.3.0 & 1.3.1 of Riak, you use the "1.3.0" version of leveldb.

Thanks, Jared.

Unfortunately I am not getting very far with this. I can't find the 
instructions I used with version 1.2.1, but copying the procedure from that 
machine:

tar -zxvf riak-1.3.1.tar.gz
mv basho-leveldb-1.3.0-0-gdbb3e19.zip riak-1.3.1/deps/eleveldb/c\_src/leveldb.zip
cd riak-1.3.1/deps/eleveldb/c\_src/
unzip leveldb.zip
mv basho-leveldb-\* leveldb
cd ../../../
make all
make devrel

â€¦make all seems to run but make devrel finishes with the errors:
