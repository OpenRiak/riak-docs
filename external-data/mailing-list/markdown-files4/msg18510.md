Hi Again,

More progress update. All the PRs are merged (thanks Bryan Hunt (ESL)
and Nick/Martin (bet365)).

I’m planning on tagging Riak with riak-2.2.5RC1 this week.

We haven’t been able to run load tests. I’m not 100% sure that all
basho’s releases had extensive load tests run, though I know that
later releases had a perf team, and MvM always load tested leveldb.

The aim is to have those willing parties that deploy riak, and
therefore have perf testing already set up, to test and report
back. The NHS will run load tests and report results back. I hope that others 
can do the same.
To the end we’ll probably tag RC1-noperftest.

There are a few failing riak tests (was Riak ever released without a
failing riak-test?) If you have the time/capacity to run riak-test,
and you’re interested in helping out, get in touch and I’ll help you
get started.

The failures, should one pique your interest:

datatypes - riak667\_mixed-eleveldb
ensemble - ensemble\_basic3-eleveldb ensemble\_basic4-eleveldb
yoko - yz\_crdt-eleveldb yz\_solr\_upgrade\_downgrade-eleveldb

Let me know if you want to look into ensemble or yoko.

Still aiming to have this tagged by end-of-week.

Cheers

Russell

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Just an update on the progress of riak-2.2.5 release. I realize we said
&gt; "end of 2017" and then "end of Jan" and then "end of Feb" and here we
&gt; are, 1st March, spring is upon us, and still no 2.2.5. I thought it best
&gt; to at least keep you posted.
&gt; 
&gt; Why no release? Well, we're not quite finished yet. In terms of what is
&gt; left:
&gt; 
&gt; - a few PRs need review and merge against the upstream Basho repo (see
&gt; [1] if you want to help there);
&gt; - Opening of PRs for gsets;
&gt; - Docs for the changes;
&gt; - Release notes;
&gt; - Tagging;
&gt; - A final round of testing (and fixing?) after all is merged;
&gt; - Client support. This is crucial, but all the above work only has
&gt; client support in the Basho erlang clients. I'm hoping the community
&gt; that uses the Java/Python/Ruby etc clients can step up here. But we can 
&gt; release Riak before all client work is done.
&gt; 
&gt; The optimist in me says 2 weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; What do I mean "release"?
&gt; 
&gt; From my point of view the release is the tags. After that I'm sincerely
&gt; hoping ESL will continue to kindly build and host the actual artifacts.
&gt; 
&gt; What's in the release?
&gt; 
&gt; As a reminder, since it's been a while since StokeCon17, this release
&gt; contains:
&gt; 
&gt; - Some developer clean-up around `make test` and `riak\_test` to make
&gt; them more reliable/trustworthy;
&gt; - Open source MDC Repl (thanks bet365!);
&gt; - A fix for a bug in riak core claim that led to unbalanced rings[2];
&gt; - `node\_confirms` a feature like `w` or `pw` but for physical diversity in 
&gt; durability[3];
&gt; - `participate in coverage` an admin setting that takes a node out of
&gt; the coverage plan (for example after adding a node while transfers
&gt; take place);
&gt; - Riak repl fix, and change to unsafe default behaviour[4];
&gt; - Addition of a GSet to riak data types;
&gt; - Fix to repl stats[5].
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry if I missed anything. The release notes will have it all.
&gt; 
&gt; Work is already begun on Riak 3.0 with OTP20 support well under way.
&gt; Some candidates for inclusion that we're working on are a new
&gt; pure-Erlang backend[6], and a radical overhaul of AAE for both intra and 
&gt; inter-cluster anti-entropy.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the delay, thanks for your patience. We’ll keep you posted.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
