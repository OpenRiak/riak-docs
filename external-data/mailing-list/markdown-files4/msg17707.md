&gt; Hello Basho,
&gt;
&gt; Today I turned on security on my cluster but riak\_explorer stopped working
&gt; after that.
&gt; Anything I need to check on riak\_explorer to make it works again?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Ajax

Hi Ajax,

After turning on Riak security, all clients must communicate with Riak over
a TLS secured connection, and must also send valid security credentials
with each request. AFAIK, this functionality has not yet been added to Riak
Explorer. There is an open github issue to add this functionality [0].

Kind Regards,

Magnus
