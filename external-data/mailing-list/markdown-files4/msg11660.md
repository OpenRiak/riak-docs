 &gt; Can you provide an example of the 2i queries you're running?

This is how I am testing it:

 Compare = fun(PID, Bucket) -&gt;
 B = Bucket,
 L1 = riakc\_pb\_socket:get\_index(PID, B, {binary\_index,
"bucket"}, B),
 L2 = riakc\_pb\_socket:get\_index(PID, B, {binary\_index,
"bucket"}, B),
 io:format("L1: ~b, L2: ~b~n",[length(L1), length(L2)]),
 Diff\_L1\_L2 = L1 -- L2,
 Diff\_L2\_L1 = L2 -- L1,
 io:format("=== L1 -- L2 ===~n~p~n~n", [Diff\_L1\_L2]),
 io:format("=== L2 -- L1 ===~n~p~n~n", [Diff\_L2\_L1]),
 Fetch = fun(Key) -&gt;
 case riakc\_pb\_socket:get(PID, B, Key) of
 {ok, \_} -&gt; io:format("FOUND: ~p~n", [Key]);
 {error, \_} -&gt; io:format("NOT FOUND: ~p~n", [Key])
 end
 end,
 io:format("=== L1 -- L2 ===~n"),
 lists:foreach(Fetch, Diff\_L1\_L2),
 io:format("=== L2 -- L1 ===~n"),
 lists:foreach(Fetch, Diff\_L2\_L1)
 end.

Which results in differences \_sometimes\_, but \_always\_ fails on get.



UPDATE:

I just re-ran the test about ~10 more times (~12 hours after the last 
series of tests) and the lists of keys returned by 2i are now always 
consistent.


However, a separate test that tries to GET the keys from the original 
set reveals 7 that a consistently missing.


So, I still have a problem, just a slightly less puzzling one.

I \_could\_ just re-insert the missing ones, but I would like to 
understand what went wrong before doing so.
