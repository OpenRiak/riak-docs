Afternoon, Evening, Morning to all,

For this installation of the recap: A video of @rklophaus, a new repo

Riak Recap for 8/16 - 8/17


1) A video of Rusty Klophaus' "Riak From Small to Large" talk from
this year's Berlin Buzzwords finally surfaced.

Watch it here ---&gt; http://blip.tv/file/3810158

2) Akhil Kodali started work on "grails-gorm-riak." This looks like
it's very beginning stages but definitely worth taking a look at.

Repo on github here ---&gt; http://github.com/akhil/grails-gorm-riak

3) The Mozilla Team working on the Test Pilot Project published a post
on their blog called, "Benchmarking Riak for the Mozilla Test Pilot
Project." This is a great post, and, as one reader expressed on
Twitter, "there are more numbers than you can shake a stick at."

Read this ---&gt;

4) mplabs and deinspanjer had a quick chat in #riak that started with,
"Does anyone know any good article that compares concrete things about
which database would be better for certain needs?"

Gist here ---&gt; http://gist.github.com/535352

5) drev1 and darrik had a brief conversation related to adding custom
Erlang map/reduce jobs to Riak.

6) Lastly, I just wanted to take a moment to highlight something that
happened on the mailing list yesterday. @siculars ( Alexander Sicular)
was eager to get some resolution on the "'Dead' files in bitcask or
something" thread that was started yesterday afternoon. So, he jumped
in the IRC Channel, found the needed info (via @dizzyd), and updated
the thread with a pointer to the IRC logs in real time (as seen here
---&gt; 
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2010-August/001788.html
).

This type of effort and dedication to helping users is awesome.
Thanks, Alexander!
