I get 

 

Erlang R15B01 (erts-5.9.1) [source] [64bit] [async-threads:0]
[kernel-poll:false]

EShell V5.9.1 (abort with ^G)

 

In the case of make devrel it is definitely skipping something as the dev
directory is completely empty.

If building 1.2.1 from source, make sure you have erlang r15B01 installed
and in your path.

 

That particular error I have never seen. If you type 'erl' in the command
line, what do you see?

Better yet I decided to build from source. But I ran into the following
error:

 

ERROR: Unable to generate spec: read file info
/usr/lib/erlang/man/man1/qemu-i386.1 failed

 

&gt;From the content this error seems to related to erlang more than riak but I
am wondering if this makes other portions of the build unavailable?

 

Thanks again.

Kevin,

 

So you are on 12.10, which is one minor release past Precise (12.04) which
is the current LTS (Long Term Support) release. I haven't confirmed that
the Precise Riak package will work on Quantal, but I suspect it will be
fine. In version mismatches most issues you'll find will be on install with
dependencies. If this is something you will rely on for a business in a
production sense, I'd recommend using a LTS release like Precise (12.04)
instead and know that we tested Riak on that platform. If this is for
development purposes, you will likely be fine on 12.10. If something
complains on install with dependencies please let me know so I can respond
differently the next time this comes up on the mailing list.

As far as I know, the lsb\_release tool is installed by default on all Ubuntu
installs. You can use it to get the codename of the release like: 

For Ubuntu 10.04 

 
 
$ lsb\_release -c
Codename: lucid

or Ubuntu 12.04 

 
 
$ lsb\_release -c 
Codename: precise

You can also get the information from the /etc/lsb-release file directly. 

% cat /etc/lsb-release 
DISTRIB\_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB\_RELEASE=12.04
DISTRIB\_CODENAME=precise
DISTRIB\_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS"

 

Hope that helps,

Jared

I was looking at the options of installing Riak and there are several
options under Ubuntu: Lucid, Natty, and Precise. This is a Linux Ubuntu
Server. I am not sure how to tell which variant it is.

 

Thank you.
