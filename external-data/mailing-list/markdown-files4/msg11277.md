Hi Sanjeev,

Looks like the node was started with node name set in the vm.args to 
riak@127.0.0.1 and then restarted with a different name 
riak@10.147.29.57. If this is a single node that has 
not yet joined a cluster, simply stop the node with riak stop, delete the 
contents of riaks ring directory, and start the node.

Hi,



Can someone help me in running riak service. Following are the things did on my 
linux 6.2 server:



Installed riak, riak-cs, stanchion services as per the instructions given @ 
http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Building-a-Local-Test-Environment/



Before making changes in /etc/riak/app.config I could succefully stark the riak 
service. However after making changes in the file as per the instructions given 
in Step:3 , failed to strat riak service.



[root@RIAK-57 ~]# riak start

Attempting to restart script through sudo -H -u riak

Riak failed to start within 15 seconds,

see the output of 'riak console' for more information.

If you want to wait longer, set the environment variable

WAIT\_FOR\_ERLANG to the number of seconds to wait.



Riak version installed: riak-1.3.1-1.el6.x86\_64



Thanks,

Sanjeev
