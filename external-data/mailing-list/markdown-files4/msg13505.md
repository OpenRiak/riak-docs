P.S. I failed to include the link to the wiki page that discusses each of 
Basho's optimizations for the Riak environment:

&gt; Basho's leveldb requirements have lead to different optimizations. Facebook 
&gt; has a captive hardware environment and usage case that does not match ours. 
&gt; I am not saying their changes are better or worse, only different.
&gt; 
&gt; Basho needs:
&gt; 
&gt; - multiple databases running simultaneously: 6 to 64
&gt; - support for slow solitary SATA drives all the way to rocking' fast FusionIO 
&gt; PCI arrays
&gt; - fast disaster recovery / repair
&gt; - aggressive delete logic to help remove large chunks of deleted data now 
&gt; instead of next year
&gt; - (and a few things still not unleashed in Riak 2.0)
&gt; 
&gt; So our compaction strategy has come a long way: from Google's original 
&gt; single thread to a thread pool that can run simultaneous companions on the 
&gt; same database as well as other databases. We have a dedicated thread that 
&gt; constantly computes the speed of the local array and gradually manipulates 
&gt; each write request to prevent Google's designed stall â€¦ maximizing total 
&gt; throughput for the simultaneous databases while maintaining a constant user 
&gt; experience. And in between all that, we have retuned the skip list, the 
&gt; bloom filter, and integrated Intel's hardware CRC assembly code.
&gt; 
&gt; That is what meets Riak's needs.

&gt;&gt; Hey Basho gang,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Have you all taken any sort of look at FB's leveldb fork, rocksdb, 
&gt;&gt; http://rocksdb.org/? Just watching Dhruba's video it seems like it may be a 
&gt;&gt; useful upgrade, 
&gt;&gt; https://code.facebook.com/videos/174548089418739/rocksdb-a-high-performance-embedded-key-value-store-for-flash-storage-data-scale/.
&gt;&gt; The main talking points seems to be that rocksdb upgrades leveldb such that 
&gt;&gt; it is more efficient when storing data more than system ram, has more 
&gt;&gt; efficient access patternsto take advantage of ssd's and has a better 
&gt;&gt; compaction story.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Care to share your thoughts?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;
