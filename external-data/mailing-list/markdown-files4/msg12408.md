Not that it is something that answers your immediate need, I just thought I'd 
point you at this post where Brian Lee Yung Rowe attempts to integrate Riak 
MapReduce and R.

&gt; I'm trying to do some image processing using OpenCV. Later I'll be doing some

&gt; is very simple with external languages but very hard with both Erlang and 
&gt; Javascript.
&gt; 
&gt; What I want to do is simply invoke an external script on each element in a 
&gt; bucket in the general case so that I can use advanced external tools in an 
&gt; arbitrary manner. I was told by someone at Basho a long time ago (about a 
&gt; year, which is a long time in internet years) that this could be done by 
&gt; invoking scripts from Erlang, but I haven't heard back from him since then 
&gt; and was hoping someone on the list could point me at an example demonstrating 
&gt; this.

&gt;&gt; Hi Jeff,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Erlang and Javascript are the only two supported "in process"
&gt;&gt; languages for map/reduce. Can you explain the process or provide the
&gt;&gt; python you want to use and perhaps someone on the list could help out
&gt;&gt; translating it to erlang?

&gt;&gt;&gt; is there a sample piece of code somewhere that demonstrates this?
