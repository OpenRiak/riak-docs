The Dynamo paper talks about Amazon addressing data center
availability by forcing the node preference lists to include nodes
across various data centers. Does Riak have this support at all? Are
there plans to include such?

I'm aware that Basho takes a different approach to data center
replication with the EnterpriseDS edition, but there are other use
cases where I think the original Dynamo approach fits. For example,
I'm presently looking into a VPS environment where some VMs are on the
same physical server. I'd like to run Riak in all the VMs, but
guarantee that at least K replicas map to different physical servers.
It seems like the Dynamo approach could fit here. Likewise, a similar
idea would hold to replicating betweek racks/blade servers/etc.

It seems like it wouldn't be too hard to add a notion of 'class' to
the nodes, and force K of the N replicas to nodes of different
classes. Think I'll spend sometime looking through the Riak source to
determine how difficult it would be to add such. Or is there a
different / better solution?

Regards,
Joe
