&gt; It's not ludicrous at all since changes in Riak 2.0 should reduce that
&gt; overhead to about 13 bytes per key, IIRC.
&gt;
&gt; In these situations, you could always use an external identity generation
&gt; process. Here's where I plug Rustflakes [1] which can generate unsigned
&gt; 64-bit, decimal, or BigInteger numbers based on a combination of time since
&gt; an epoch, a machine identifier, and an internally cycling identifier that
&gt; resets every millisecond.
&gt;
&gt; I can't lay claim to the idea, but I can lay claim to writing parts of it in
&gt; C#.
