Hi everyone,

first of all, this is my first post in the mail list but I hope it won't be
the last. I like Riak a lot and it is making me start learning (and loving)
Erlang.

Does it exist something in Riak allowing to see which buckets are being
most frequently used, how many operations per second do they receive and
what type (get, put, delete, mapreduce) and so on. Is it possible with Riak
or some external tool to do it? I have seen the /stats url but even I find
it useful, it would be nice having something a bucket basis.

Of course, it is always possible to do that on a LB or similar, but it
would be nice to have integrated into Riak itself or with a tool as
transparent as possible. What do you think?

Thanks a lot,
Jos√© Ignacio Gil Jaldo
