I am using riak-js for connecting with riak from within node.
However, riak-js does not support any search APIs. I wrote a small
example in node.js to show how to hit the SOLR interface, which I've
shared with the developer of riak-js with the hope that he runs with
it. Nonetheless, some of you may find this gist helpful:
