Hi folks,

We were just wondering what is the best possible way to model 1 â€“ N 
relationships in Riak. We know that there are links but the mapreduce is too 
slow. So, we moved towards using RiakSearch but it seems that modeling 
relationships and having lists in riak search KV object doesn't quiet do the 
job.

So, we were looking for some guidance on this front.

Thanks
Harshal
