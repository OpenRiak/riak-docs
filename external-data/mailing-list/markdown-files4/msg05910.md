Riak Recap for December 7 - 8
=======================

1) Some new and updated documentation to pass along:

\* Basho DA Justin Shoffstall added a page to the wiki with some info
about File System Tuning ---&gt;

\* Elias Levy updated the MR/Search Docs. Updated content here ---&gt;

2) The riak-entity code that the team at Circuit Hub is working on
just hit 0.1.4

\* Latest here ---&gt; http://search.npmjs.org/#/riak-entity

3) Mathias Meyer wrote a great blog post about Consistent Hashing.

4) tddium, a hosted testing environment for Ruby Apps, launched today
with support for Riak.

\* If anyone is interested in how well this integration works, I would
ping Chris Meikeljohn. (twitter.com/cmeik). He's making use of it
already and apparently it's quite nice.

5) Another video of Kresten Krab Thorup talking about Riak on Drugs
has surfaced. This one was recorded at Strange Loop.
