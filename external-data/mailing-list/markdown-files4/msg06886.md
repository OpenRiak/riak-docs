Hi Marco,

&gt; I have a riak cluster and I'm seeing a write fail rate ofÂ  10% to 30%

&gt; 300 new objects per second to the same bucket. If I direct the write to
&gt; a new (empty) bucket the problem goes away and I don't see any failure.

A couple of context establishing questions:

1. What sort of error are you getting when a write fails?
2. What backend are you using? (I'm guessing LevelDB)
3. What do your keys look like? For example, are they date-based (and
thus naturally increasing) or are they UUIDs? :)
