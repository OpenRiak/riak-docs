Hi Mike,

Listing buckets does the same full scan as listing keys.

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; While we cannot say "give us all keys in a bucket" because it's flat
&gt; and causes a full scan, is there any way to say "give me all matching
&gt; buckets" without doing a full scan, or does that still hit the
&gt; flattened-key problem?
&gt; (eg, there's no Bucket-&gt;Key relationship, but is there a
&gt; "system-&gt;bucket" relationship? Match all buckets "foo" for the MR
&gt; input.)
&gt;
&gt; If not, when doing MRs, you have to know all of the buckets ahead of
&gt; time, else you run into a full scan?
&gt; Is this correct?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
