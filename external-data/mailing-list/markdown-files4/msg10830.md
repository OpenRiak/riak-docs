Cool. Thanks for the explanation.

&gt; If you've installed from the apt/yum repository you've installed a single
&gt; Riak node on your machine. Riak, though, is configured by default to write
&gt; data to three servers. If some of those servers aren't available, Riak is
&gt; going to write to a different server via hinted handoff[1]. Since you are
&gt; only running one node, that single node receives all copies of your data in
&gt; the hopes that some day the other Riak servers in the cluster will come
&gt; back for their data.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This isn't quite true. A single node cluster is just going to simply store
&gt; three copies on 3 of its local vnodes. No hinted handoff is involved. If
&gt; you add nodes to the cluster, as Evan said, data will be distributed
&gt; amongst them.
&gt;
&gt; Ben,
&gt;
&gt; tl;dr, Riak will store three copies on your data, by default, even if
&gt; you're using a single server.
