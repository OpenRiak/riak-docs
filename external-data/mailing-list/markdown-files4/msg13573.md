&gt; Hello

&gt; mongoimport is blazingly fast compared with my java-riak-client inspired
&gt; groovy load script (using pb). I'm just trying to import JSON data for a
&gt; small dataset. There's just no comparison.

Gideon's response [0] to your load balancing thread hints at what may
be causing your slow load times. If you front a cluster with a load
balancer, it'll help ensure that you are maximizing the throughput of
your entire cluster as opposed to just one of its nodes.

HAProxy is probably be the quickest way to get a load balancer in
front of your cluster to balance PB connections. An example
configuration file can be found here. [1]

&gt; It would be handy if Riak came with an equivalent 'riakimport' tool.
&gt;

Noted. I'll ensure that this feedback makes it back to our product
management team.

&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
