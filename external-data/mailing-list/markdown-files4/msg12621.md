We're pleased to announce a new minor release of Riak CS, including both bug 
fixes and minor enhancements.

Highlights include addressing a stats bug, fixing downloads of objects written 
via Riak CS prior to 1.3, and improvements to garbage collection to minimize 
cluster impact when objects are deleted.

We've also significantly reorganized the Riak CS content on docs.basho.com to 
differentiate operational from development concerns, mirroring recent changes 
to Riak documentation.

Thanks.
