&gt; Those methods both work with the RawClient and give good results. Thanks

&gt; It was a bug (you're original issue.) Thanks for the find, sorry for the
&gt; inconvenience. The problem was an incorrect encoding of the reduce phase
&gt; argument, meaning that Riak ignored it.
&gt;
&gt; The patch is on this branch
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/tree/bz1262\_pb\_fetchIndex
&gt;
&gt; I'm hoping to get it merged in sooner rather than later, after which I'll
&gt; cut another point release.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again
&gt;
