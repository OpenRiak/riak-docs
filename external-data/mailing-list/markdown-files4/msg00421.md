Riak Recap for 5/20


1) Q --- Anyone know how i could query Riak directly with ExtJS, is
there a lib out there or can i use the jquery one? (from BBHoss via
#riak)

 A --- There isn't a specialized lib but you could probably use our
js client if you were OK with also taking jquery as a dependency.

 JS client info is here ---&gt;
http://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Client+Libraries#ClientLibraries-Javascript

2) Q --- Can riak data be encrypted on disk? Maybe an option with
innostore? (from bkaney via #riak)

 A --- You could use an encrypted disk, or encrypt the data as it
goes in but Riak doesn't provide any built-in.

3) Q --- Is there a best practice for querying a riak cluster, like
round-robin or something? (from howboutjoe via #riak)

 A --- Any node in the cluster can respond to any request so a
round-robin distribution would work.
