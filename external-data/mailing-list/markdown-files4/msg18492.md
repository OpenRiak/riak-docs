Raghu, 

What bistro are you running?

&gt; Hi Raghu,
&gt; At present Riak is still stuck on the r16 basho OTP. This will change next 
&gt; year. For now, and the next release of riak, r16 is the compiler you need.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to use riak\_repl with open source riak, there are a couple of 
&gt; options. There is the 2.2.4 tag in the basho riak repo, which bet365 kindly 
&gt; put together when riak\_repl was open sourced. Cloning 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak and checking out tag 2.2.4, then running `make 
&gt; rel` will get you a local release of OS riak as it was at 2.2.3 + riak\_repl. 
&gt; Someone did mention maybe building packages of 2.2.4, if you’d rather 
&gt; download than build your own, but I don’t know if that happened yet.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to \_use\_ MDC you can follow the docs on basho’s site 
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/configuring/v3-multi-datacenter/.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a branch develop-2.2.5 which is the active work for the next release 
&gt; of riak, which will contain riak\_repl. We plan to release riak-2.2.5 (OS 
&gt; riak+repl, and some small features+bug fixes) in early 2018.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope that helps
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; 
&gt; Russell

&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I want to use riak MDC replication using riak\_repl module. Is there any 
&gt;&gt; documentation on how I can perform this integration? Do you know what erlang 
&gt;&gt; compiler version I should be using to compile the code? Any help on this is 
&gt;&gt; appreciated.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks
&gt;&gt; Raghu
