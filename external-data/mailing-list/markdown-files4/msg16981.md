Hello,

I have a mapreduce job, which is supposed to take long.
I invoke it via http interface with timeout value set to 1200000000.
Curl script terminates in 60 minutes without any returned value with exit
status 0.
Is that a curl timeout being triggered or some server-side timeout?
Does the job continues exectuion on server side after client termination?

Best regards,
Eugene
