I think this is just an area that hasn't been addressed unlike things like
a "hot" copy in the rdbms world..
I think at least a plan for how a hotcopy tool for a riak core semantics
database system
could be made would be a good step in the right direction, ie.. maybe a
combination of
specifying a target system to transfer to, then converge the source ring ie
5 nodes to 1..
having a riak\_backup\_vnode with a batch put fsm, that transfers 1-10mb's
worth of keys to
another riak system's vnode compressed with crc checks and writes directly
to leveldb.
Or a wiki of some sort outlining possible strategies for achieving this.

The current backup approach is not at all the way it could or should be.

&gt;
&gt; So this lead to some interesting convos on twitter and here. Others have
&gt; addressed some things. I figure it helps to explain the sad lonely world I
&gt; live in - It's called "Enterprise".
&gt;
&gt; A few folks are somewhat aware that our product uses Riak under the
&gt; covers. We have a hosted SaaS version and we also allow customers to
&gt; install it entirely isolated on their own networks. The only people who do
&gt; this are traditional enterprises.
&gt;
&gt; The very first question that comes up during an installation after "you
&gt; need HOW many servers?" is "How do I back this up". Since we use LevelDB,
&gt; we have the worst of backup options - coordinated node shutdown and
&gt; tarball'ing. The thing is we can't say to them "you never need to back this
&gt; up. Just add more nodes!"
&gt;
&gt; That doesn't check the box they have. That doesn't meet the legal and
&gt; industry guidelines they have to follow. So now that they've swallowed the
&gt; "you need 5 servers just for the DB" we now hit them with "your backup
&gt; strategy involves this complicated orchestrated shutdown process and some
&gt; tarballs". When faced with that, we ran into a new issue. They started
&gt; doing vm snapshots and stupid shit like vmotioning the instances (oh yes,
&gt; they virtualize it =/).
&gt;
&gt; If you aren't familiar with vmotion, it's basically vmware's bullshit that
&gt; says they can somehow defy the laws of physics. If you read the details on
&gt; exactly what vmotion does (hint - it doesn't actually take the node offline
&gt; - vmware just "buffers" the pending network requests among other things),
&gt; you can see how this can TOTALLY fuck up Riak clusters.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway so this is the world we have to live in and we have to provide
&gt; something that resembles a backup they can DR from. Our normal course of
&gt; action is to tell them to contact Basho for RiakDS and go multi-site. SAN
&gt; based snapshots largely meet that need for them.
&gt;
&gt; For what it's worth, this is not just a problem with Riak and there are
&gt; legitimate use cases for wanting to have a "copy" of production data for
&gt; testing new code against. The biggest problem is once you get data IN to
&gt; riak (and other stores), it's REALLY difficult to prune it outside of
&gt; expensive "walk all the things", an external index of some kind or
&gt; resorting to application-level business logic tooling.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not making a judgement call. Trade offs are a thing but it's
&gt; definitely a issue. At this point I'm considering resorting to a
&gt; post-commit hook machination of some kind.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; TL;DR - I actually agree with John, SANs make management of storage
&gt;&gt; stupidly easy, but you pay more money for it. Make the right decision for
&gt;&gt; your org, but make sure you can monitor and backup that decision. The SAN
&gt;&gt; isn't a magic box. And a Drobo b1200i [2] is definitely not a SAN.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm going to take a competing view here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; SAN is a bit overloaded of a term at this point. Nothing precludes a SAN
&gt;&gt;&gt; from being performant or having SSDs. Yes the cost is overkill for fiber
&gt;&gt;&gt; but iSCSI is much more realistic. Alternately you can even do ATAoE.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Agreed. You can buy a glorified direct attached storage device with a few
&gt;&gt; ethernet ports in it, but vendors will call it a SAN.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; From a hardware perspective, if I have 5 pizza boxes as riak nodes, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; can only fit so many disks in them. Meanwhile I can add another shelf to my
&gt;&gt;&gt; SAN and expand as needed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We have the ability to cram 16x 960GB SSDs into the front of a Dell R720
&gt;&gt; for about $550 per drive... no SAN vendor can beat you on price for that.
&gt;&gt; SAN storage is an order of magnitude more expensive, but...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally backup of a SAN is MUCH easier than backup of a riak node
&gt;&gt;&gt; itself. It's a snapshot and you're done. Mind you nothing precludes you
&gt;&gt;&gt; from doing LVM snapshots in the OS but you still need to get the data OFF
&gt;&gt;&gt; that system for it to be truly backed up.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The products worth of being called a SAN offer you fantastic features
&gt;&gt; like application aware volume snapshots, multi-site async and synchronous
&gt;&gt; block level synchronization, and all kinds of amazing features that mean
&gt;&gt; you never need to think about your storage beyond "HEY THERE, MAGIC BOX, I
&gt;&gt; NEED 500GB OF SPACE!"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I love riak and other distributed stores but backing them up is NOT a
&gt;&gt;&gt; solved problem. Walking all keys, coordinating the take down of all your
&gt;&gt;&gt; nodes in a given order or whatever your strategy is a serious pain point.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Using a SAN or local disk also doesn't excuse you from watching I/O
&gt;&gt;&gt; performance. With a SAN I get multiple redundant paths to a block device
&gt;&gt;&gt; and I don't get that necessarily with local storage.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Just my two bits.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For many applications, if you need storage performance outside of the
&gt;&gt; main chassis, you could also look at an approach like Microsoft take with
&gt;&gt; the Fast Track Data Warehouse Reference Architecture [1]. For those who
&gt;&gt; don't want to read, you line up the ability of your CPUs to process data
&gt;&gt; with the ability of your disks to produce data. For SQL Server, you assume
&gt;&gt; ~300MB/s of processing per core. Core count \* 300MB/s = total combined disk
&gt;&gt; speed. It's easy to use something like a Dell MD1220 or an HP MSA to get
&gt;&gt; this kind of performance, too, without breaking the bank and upgrading to
&gt;&gt; something like a 3PAR or EMC.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you do it? Sure.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Should you do it? No.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An advantage of Riak is that you can avoid the cost of SAN storage by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; getting duplication at the machine level rather than rely on your storage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vendor to provide it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Running Riak on a SAN also exposes you to the SAN becoming your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bottleneck; you only have so many fiber/iSCSI ports and a fixed number of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disks. The risk of storage contention is high, too, so you can run into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; latency issues that are difficult to diagnose without looking into both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Riak as well as the storage system.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Keeping cost in mind, too, SAN storage is about 10x the cost of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consumer grade SSDs. Not to mention feature licensing and support... The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cost comparison isn't favorable.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please note: Even though your vendor calls it a SAN, that doesn't mean
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a SAN.
