Hi Erteshma,

There's a thorough page on the wiki all about what ports and network specifics 
Riak requires:

http://wiki.basho.com/Network-Security-and-Firewall-Configurations.html

That should answer your questions, but if it doesn't let us know.

&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt; Which ports are used in a Riak cluster?
&gt; We now that port 8099 (by default) is used for handoff or port 8087 (by 
&gt; default) is used for HTTP interface.
&gt; But on which port do Riak nodes talk with each other. For example when a new 
&gt; record comes to one node, that node needs to talk with other nodes on cluster 
&gt; to find where this record should be saved. Question is on which port number 
&gt; Riak nodes talk with each other internally. I guess it should be a random 
&gt; port number. Am I right?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
