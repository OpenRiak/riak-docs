&gt; Could someone answer is basho\_bench's basho\_bench\_driver\_http\_raw driver

&gt; I'm trying to benchmark my Riak node using basho\_bench,
&gt; using basho\_bench\_driver\_http\_raw driver. But when i'm trying to run it all
&gt; instances of basho\_bench\_driver\_http\_raw clients instantly crashes with
&gt; error:

Hi Denis,

It looks like the raw HTTP driver currently lacks support for delete
operations. I've added it on this branch if you want to try it:
