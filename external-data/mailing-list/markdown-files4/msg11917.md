Hi Justin,

For starters, how much data are you restoring?

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; Is there any way to determine progress/percent complete?
&gt;
&gt; This has been running for 3 days now. I figured it would finish over the
&gt; weekend but it hasn't.
&gt;
&gt; # riak-admin restore riak@ riak
&gt; /var/lib/riak/backups/all\_nodes.20130725.bak
&gt; Restoring from '/var/lib/riak/backups/all\_nodes.20130725.bak' to cluster
&gt; to which 'riak@ belongs.
&gt;
&gt; I'm reluctant to kill it. It could be nearly complete OR it could be 3
&gt; more days from finishing. The alternative is to clear my Riak cluster and
&gt; re-import/ETL the data from scratch, which takes at least 5 days.
&gt;
&gt; In addition to determining progress for "restore", I'm also interested in
&gt; determining progress for "backup".
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the help.
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards,
