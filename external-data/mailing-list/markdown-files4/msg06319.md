Daniel,

The ring size must be a power of two because it must evenly divide 2^160
(the size of our consistent hashing space), which is not divisible by 3.
Using a non-power-of-two ring size will have unknown or unpredictable
effects.

&gt; Hello riak users
&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to get my head around the partitioning in Riak
&gt; Quite recent thread was very helpful
&gt;
&gt; http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.riak.user/6207/focus=6266
&gt;
&gt; Let's say I install Riak on 3 nodes (initially), which will possibly
&gt; grow to 10 or more.
&gt; Default partition size is 64 and I store some data into bucket with n=2.
&gt; Does it mean that both copies of keys that are in 64th partition would
&gt; land on the same physical machine (node 1)?
&gt; From what I understood keys from 64th partition land in 1st partition
&gt; as well, which in that case would be on node1
&gt;
&gt; If the answer is Yes, would it be better if I set the max ring size to
&gt; 72 which divides nicely by 3?
&gt; Basho wiki states that ring size should be power of 2.
&gt; Is there any performance impact of setting it to such a non-standard value?
&gt;
&gt; Or is there any better approach if I know that I will start with 3
&gt; machines?
&gt; Apart from changing n to 3 of course.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; D.
