Hi guys,
I'm afraid I'm already wearing too many hats to pick up the role of
maintainer of the Ansible-riak repository. However, definitely happy to
help out a little.
I'll take a look at the dev-2.x branch and see what I have to change to
make it run on Ubuntu 14.04.

Cheers,
Toby

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; While I'm not thrilled our role is out of date, I'm excited to hear
&gt; &gt;&gt; you care. We're actively looking for a maintainer of the Ansible Riak
&gt; &gt;&gt; repo [1]. A quick review of the branching shows that it's a little
&gt; &gt;&gt; wild west in there.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; If you're game to step up as the maintainer, I'd love to sync up with
&gt; &gt;&gt; you. We have some great resources (people and existing code) and we're
&gt; &gt;&gt; in need of someone who wants to curate them all.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I am actually working on a rewrite of the Galaxy role that we used to
&gt; have
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; up there to be simpler and support all of the 2.x features of Riak.
&gt; You can
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; access it here:

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I would greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions as well as any
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; contributions you may have from your testing on Ubuntu / Debian, since
&gt; I am
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; using it with CentOS7 and may not have time to test it with Ubuntu for
&gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; little while still.
