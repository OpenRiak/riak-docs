Hi, I'm interested in developing a backend using OpenLDAP's memory-mapped 
database library (MDB). Unfortunately Erlang is not a language I've used 
before. Any tips on where to get started?


You can find information on MDB here: http://highlandsun.com/hyc/mdb/

Its read performance is several times faster than anything else out there, and 
scales perfeclty linearly since readers require no locks. Its write 
performance is also quite fast...
