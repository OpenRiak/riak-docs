I'm down for a chat on how to finally get our collective stuff together.
Maybe a google hangout?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I have created a Slack channel. Here is the invitation link[1]
&gt; I think it is better to have a quick talk beforehand in Slack to
&gt; organize big meeting with a rest of Riak funs/lovers.
&gt; We are ready to provide some resources and i believe lots of folks
&gt; would like to do the same.
&gt; It would be very efficient to organize, as fast as possible.
&gt; For anyone missed, there is an alternate mail group[2] if this one
&gt; ripped of suddenly.

&gt; &gt; Great idea Heinz, I think speaking together is the right start.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I’m free next week, but a key member of our team is not. I know we’re
&gt; never going to get everyone to agree on a time, but if we could do it early
&gt; the following week it would suit more. Otherwise, I will attend and pass
&gt; info along, so don’t worry. I think bet365 should be involved too. They
&gt; probably have the largest team anywhere working on Riak.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe a doodle http://doodle.com/en\_GB/ would be a good thing?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Heya everyone,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I figured I’ll pick up the initiative here and see if we all can come
&gt; together before fragmentation hits. Annette mentioned this today and I
&gt; think she’s right.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; There are many people that want to see risk(\_core) continue to evolve
&gt; and improve, out of the top of my head there are ES - who picked up support
&gt; for riak, NHS/UK - which is using it and seem to keep doing so, there is
&gt; Gordon, Annette, Chris, Tristan, Mariano and me who all have an interest to
&gt; keep things going. I’m pretty sure I forgot a good few people (sorry! It
&gt; doesn’t mean I love you any less, I just have a brain like a sieve).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Amongst all of us I’m sure we’ve quite some forks. Tristan, Chris,
&gt; Mariano and me started https://github.com/Kyorai to consolidate the git
&gt; repos that correspond to the current hex packages as an example, NHS runs a
&gt; fork of core at https://github.com/ramensen/riak\_core and I guess ES will
&gt; have one too by now. (Again apologies if I forgot someone).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am quite sure that all of us have the same goal and probably are
&gt; interested in the same things (keeping riak(\_core) strong). So what I’d
&gt; like to suggest is we find a time to sit together and chat about how we
&gt; pool resources instead of trying to cross merge in N different places.
&gt; Perhaps late next week EU afternoon US morning? Please raise a hand if
&gt; interested, discuss and share times that would work for you :)
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Heinz
