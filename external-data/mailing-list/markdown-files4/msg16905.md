Hi,

A poolboy or other connection pool based solution still means 1 open tcp
connection per worker. I'm exploring the option of having a single TCP
connection (actually 1 for each Riak node) and then multiplex concurrent
requests to a DB node in a single TCP connection (think HTTP/2 TCP
connection multiplexing).

Thanks.

Paulo

&gt; You can find a list of community maintained PBC pooling ‎libraries in the
&gt; Erlang sub-section of this page:

&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/libraries/#Community-Libraries
&gt;
&gt; II was under the impression that Riak Erlang client ships with poolboy ‎so
&gt; I'm uncertain of the distinction between the different libraries listed.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps someone could comment to clarify?

&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Does the Erlang Riak client support multiplexing multiple concurrent calls
&gt; in a single TCP connection? Specifically when using the PB interface
&gt; (riakc\_pb\_socket:start\_link).
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
