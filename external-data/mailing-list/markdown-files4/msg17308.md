In erlang? Might save myself the trouble and wait if so.

&gt; &gt; I would love to see a register that takes the logical clock, and
&gt; &gt; timestamp for resolution, rather than just a straightup timestamp. My
&gt; &gt; biggest ask though is delta-CRDTs. Delta-CRDTs with a decent
&gt; &gt; anti-entropy algorithm would allow our system to scale from 1000s of
&gt; &gt; keys to 100ks of keys.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Nonetheless, Riak\_dt is an awesome library, and we're probably
&gt; &gt; planning on contributing back to it soonish, especially if any of the
&gt; &gt; other comments on this thread are things we need, and Basho doesn't.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Riak DT[1] is in need of some love. I know that some of you on this list 
&gt; &gt;&gt; (Sargun, are you here? Heinz?) have expressed opinions on the work that 
&gt; &gt;&gt; needs doing. Here is my short list, I would love to hear opinions on 
&gt; &gt;&gt; priority, and any additions to this list:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. merger smaller map branch
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. deltas
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. new data types (we have a range register and some and 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Multi-Value-Register to add, any more?)
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4. Internal state as records or maps (but not these messy tuples)
&gt; &gt;&gt; 5. update to rebar3
&gt; &gt;&gt; 6. update to latest erlang
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Iâ€™m pretty sure there is plenty more. Would greatly appreciate your 
&gt; &gt;&gt; feedback.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Many thanks
&gt; &gt;&gt;
