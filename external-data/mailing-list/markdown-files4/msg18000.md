Another option would be to use Riak via Docker:
https://hub.docker.com/r/basho/riak-kv/

Or, use VMs, but that's pretty heavy.

If you have issues building Riak, that's what this mailing list is
for. Good luck!

&gt;&gt; When I had three AWS servers it was easy to get them working together as

&gt;&gt; package always installs to "Riak"?
&gt;
&gt; The packages are not meant to be used this way. If you need to run
&gt; multiple nodes on the same server (only for development purposes,
&gt; right??) then building Riak from source is the best way to do so:
&gt;
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.2.0/setup/installing/source/
&gt;
&gt; You will want to use a command like this:
&gt;
&gt; make DEVNODES=3 stagedevrel
