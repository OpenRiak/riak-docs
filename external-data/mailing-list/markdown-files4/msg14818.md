Hi Lloyd,

As long as the buckets use the default bucket properties (Riak 1.X
series) or share a bucket type (Riak 2.X series), there is no real
limit to how many you can create outside of server capacity limits.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; Is there a practical limit to the number of buckets defined in a given Riak 
&gt; installation?
&gt;
&gt; E.g.: I could have a bucket called people with records for each person. Or, I 
&gt; could have a bucket for each person with records related to that person. But 
&gt; clearly, in the second case, the number of buckets could get quite large.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
