Thanks Brian for putting fix together so quickly.

I think I found something else though.
In JSONConverter I don't see vclock being set in toDomain() when converting
deleted sibling?
That vclock should be used for following delete if I understood it
correctly?

Also where can I download latest build? I tried
http://riak-java-client.s3.amazonaws.com/riak-client-1.1.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar
but access is denied

Cheers
Daniel

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As a side question, what is the best way to delete such an object i.e.
&gt; once
&gt; &gt; I know one of the siblings has 'deleted' flag true because I fetched it?
&gt; &gt; Should I just use DomainBucket.delete(key) without providing any vclock?
&gt; &gt; Would it wipe it from Riak or create yet another sibling?
&gt;
&gt; You should always use vclocks when possible, which in the case it is.
&gt; There are additional issues around doing the delete without a vclock
&gt; and if there's concurrently a store operation occurring.
&gt;
&gt; Ideally you should look at why you're getting that tombstone sibling.
&gt; If it's simply a case of high write concurrency and you're using
&gt; vclocks with your writes, then there's not much you can do except
&gt; resolve it later (without changing how you're using the DB)... but
&gt; usually these things are caused by writes without a vclock.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah, that is the case. When the ability to pass fetch/store/delete
&gt; &gt;&gt; meta was added to DomainBucket way back when it appears that was
&gt; &gt;&gt; missed.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'll add it and forward-port to 1.4.x as well and cut new jars. Should
&gt; &gt;&gt; be avail by tomorrow morning at the latest.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi I'm using Riak 1.3.1 and Java client 1.1.2
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Using http and curl I see 4 siblings for an object one of which has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; X-Riak-Deleted: true
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but when I'm using Java client with DomainBucket my Converter's method
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; toDomain is called only 3 times.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have set the property
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; builder.returnDeletedVClock(true);
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on my DomainBuilder which I keep reusing for all queries and store
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; operations (I guess that's good practice btw.?)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I run that under debugger and it seems raw client sees 4 siblings but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; passes
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over only 3 due to bug (I think) in DomainBucket.fetch() method which
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; should
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if (fetchMeta.hasReturnDeletedVClock()) {
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; so.returnDeletedVClock(fetchMeta.getReturnDeletedVClock());
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; }
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at the end, as store() method has.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Could you confirm or I'm I completely wrong?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
