&gt; When you do a bucket list you are actually listing all keys in 1/N
&gt; partitions and extracting the bucket names from the keys(which are
&gt; bucket++key). So, when you remove all the keys in a bucket you effectively
&gt; remove the bucket because no keys in the keylist will return as being
&gt; members of that bucket.

&gt; If I remove all keys from a bucket that bucket is not visible when I do

&gt; I know buckets are only prefixes for keys so in theory bucket does not
&gt; know if it's empty (or maybe it does) but to me it looks like only buckets
&gt; with keys are visible.
&gt;
&gt; Is there any purging mechanism in Riak to remove unused buckets?
