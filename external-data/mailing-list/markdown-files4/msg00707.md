Thanks for the info. I saw the java one already, but I noticed it
said the API isn't quite complete yet. :)
Put me down for a vote on PBC support on official java client. Most of
our backend stuff is Java.
We use the official client lib with groovy.

&gt; Yes, protobuffs is the fastest interface, but you can also use Python (for 
&gt; which the PBC was originally written), Java, or Ruby.

&gt; Java: http://github.com/krestenkrab/riak-java-pb-client/

&gt;
&gt; More officially supported clients will be getting the PBC option in the near 
&gt; future.

&gt;&gt; There are various riak clients out there right now.
&gt;&gt; Some official, some not. Most are http REST based.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; as far as I know, the erlang native client is the only prototocol buffer
&gt;&gt; based version.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I remember hearing that protocol buffer version is about 10x faster
&gt;&gt; than HTTP.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; so if I want to bulk load a lot of data, is using erlang client the fastest
&gt;&gt; way?
