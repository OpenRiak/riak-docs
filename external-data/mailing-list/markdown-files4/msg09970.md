Hi!

I have a question about support by riak of erlang R16A and later 
versions, that doesn't have parametrized modules?
This is, because there are work to replace pmod with pmod 
parse\_transform and or rewrite a code, that use pmods in

other libraries as mochiweb too.
Did you plan it? How did you plan it and at when do you plan to start to 
support?


Many thanks!
