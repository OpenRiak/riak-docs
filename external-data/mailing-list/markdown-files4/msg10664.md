I'm wondering if we could get a 1.1.2 version bump pretty soon. Not being able 
to do 2i over PBC with 1.1.1 is rather painful and I kind of need a released 
version to send it to production.

Thanks,
Sean McKibben

&gt; Hey riak-users,
&gt; 
&gt; Today we released the Ruby Riak Client (riak-client gem), version
&gt; 1.1.1. The only change from version 1.1.0 was a fix for older
&gt; patchlevels of Ruby 1.8.7 (before p315) that had a bug in Net::HTTP.
&gt; We encountered this bug when testing the upcoming Riak 1.3 release on
&gt; Ubuntu 10.04LTS, which has a maximum Ruby version of 1.8.7p249. If you
&gt; are on one of those old versions, it is definitely recommended to
&gt; upgrade to a later patchlevel or Ubuntu release and avoid this bug
&gt; altogether.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
