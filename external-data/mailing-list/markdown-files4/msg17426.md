&gt; &gt; theres no guarantee vnodes are assigned to unique servers..
&gt;
&gt; referencing the docs
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Nodes \*attempt\* to claim their partitions at intervals around the ring
&gt; such that there is an even distribution amongst the member nodes and that
&gt; no node is responsible for more than one replica of a key.

&gt;&gt; I have a Riak cluster (of 3 nodes, with 64 partitions and n\_val = 3) but
&gt;&gt; I find that for some objects, their hosting partitions / vnodes are not
&gt;&gt; spread out across the 3 nodes. In some cases, 2 of them are on 1 node and
&gt;&gt; the third is on a second node. That runs contrary to my understanding (link
&gt;&gt; here: http://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.1.4/learn/concepts/clusters/) that
&gt;&gt; the data is spread out across partitions in such a way that the partitions
&gt;&gt; are on different servers. Is there something I'm missing here please in
&gt;&gt; terms of how Riak works? Thanks...
