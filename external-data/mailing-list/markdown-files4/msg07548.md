Hey list,

Can someone confirm if 2i will work with multi backend please? I get this
error when running an index phase in map reduce:
"indexes\_not\_supported,riak\_kv\_multi\_backend".

Yet, the following pull request suggests that this would work:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/258/commits

And commit 8e11d114 appears in tag 1.1.1 which I'm running:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/commits/1.1.1?page=3

Thanks
Matt
