Yes, it is thread safe, you can treat them as singleton instances per 
bucket, the following order is the kind of the general usage pattern:


 \* Fetch bucket.
 \* Optional: If exists verify it has your application values (N value, etc)
 \* If doesn't exist create it with your settings.
 \* Cache it as a singleton instance (You could create a /"final
 Map buckets=new HashMap&lt;&gt;()"/) and re-use it in your
 application; assuming your initialization is not lazy, or if it is
 use proper thread safety initialization.

Hope that helps,

Guido.

Is the Bucket class reusable and thread-safe? I.e. can I create my 
Bucket objects during instantiation of client class, and then reuse 
the same bucket for all operations for the application lifetime? Or 
should buckets be re-created for each request?


Thanks
