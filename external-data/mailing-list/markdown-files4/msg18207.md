I've raised an issue with Core today (
https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/issues/908), related to the claim
algorithms.

There's a long-read associated with this, which provides a broader analysis
of how claim works with the ring:

https://github.com/martinsumner/riak\_core/blob/mas-claimv2issues/docs/ring\_claim.md

I believe the long-read explains some of the common mysterious issues which
can occur with claim.

We're in the process of fixing up the property-based tests for
riak\_core\_claim.erl, and will then be looking to make some improvements to
claim v2 to try and pass the improved tests.

Big question is though, how can we progress any contribution we make into
the Riak codebase? What is the plan going forward for open-source
contributions to Riak? Do Basho have any contingency plans for smoothly
handing over open-source code to the community, before the list of Basho's
Github people (https://github.com/orgs/basho/people) who still work at
Basho is reduced to zero?

Is this something of concern to others?

Regards

Martin
