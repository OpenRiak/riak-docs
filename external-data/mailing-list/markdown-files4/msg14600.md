Hi Charles,

AFAIK we haven't ever tested Riak Cs with the MapR connector. However, if
MapR works with S3, you should just have to change the IP to point to a
load balancer in front of your local Riak CS cluster. I'm unaware of how to
change that setting in MapR though. It seems like a question for them and
not Basho.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I would like to use MapR with Riak CS for hadoop map reduce jobs. My code
&gt; is currently referring to objects using s3n:// urls.
&gt; I'd like to be able to have the hadoop code on MapR point to the Riak CS
&gt; cluster using the s3 url.
&gt; Is there a proxy or hostname setting in hadoop to be able to route the s3
&gt; url to the riak cs cluster ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
