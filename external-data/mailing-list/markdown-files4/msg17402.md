Yes. There is no concept of "master" or "slave" with Stanchion, since
only one Stanchion process should ever be running at a time and
servicing requests.

&gt; Also, you said that if Stanchion is down it can not create users and
&gt; buckets... but can it still create keys inside the existing buckets? and
&gt; also read data from the nodes?

Yes, since these operations do not involve Stanchion.
