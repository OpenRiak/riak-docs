I was testing some more.. and now the 400 issue (files from 1024-8191K) is
solved .. the 403 issue indeed is not yet solved (files &gt; 8192K)

so indeed still an issue :-(

here a pcap of the 403 issue (with -w option this time :-)

&gt; Just my two cents,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; tcpdump 'host 172.16.3.21' -s 65535 -i eth0 &gt; /opt/dump.pcap
&gt;
&gt; tcpdump's option "-w file.pcap" is helpful because dump contains
&gt; not only header information but raw packet data.
&gt;
&gt; How about "403 - AccessDenied" case? Is it also solved by version
&gt; up or still an issue?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
