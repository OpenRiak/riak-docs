Can you recycle the keys rather than deleting them?  We mark them as available 
for deletion and keep a key recycle pool where we pull new keys from.

 Hi list,

We’re looking for the best way to handle large scale expiration of 
no-longer-useful data stored in Riak. We asked a while back, and the 
recommendation was to store the data in time-segmented buckets (bucket per day 
or per month), query on the current buckets, and use the streaming list keys 
API to handle slowly deleting the buckets that have aged out.

Is that still the best approach for doing this kind of task? Or is there a 
better approach?

Thanks!
