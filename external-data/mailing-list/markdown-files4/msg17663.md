Hi,

While testing my infrastructure under heavy load I realized that all 
nodes for every single solr search, that must be related to YZ Coverage 
Plan.


Is there any way to tune my Solr coverage by choosing wether I want to 
distribute the query as much as possible, or to limit it to as few nodes 
as possible ?


Thanks for your help

Guillaume
