Hi

Recently I have had some problems in my cluster on Riak, when I make a put on a 
node, 
Riak sends {error, &lt;&lt;"timeout"&gt;&gt;}, I dont know which is the cause, all nodes in 
the cluster
are agree.
I use protobuffs to connect erlang client application to Riak, but when {error, 
&lt;&lt;"timeout"&gt;&gt;} 
happens, my connection to riak node is down (disconnected).
Recently our servers are restarted but I dont know if it was the problem or the 
cluster
is not configured correctly, the main question is:

Which ones are the causes for this failure?

Thanks

Jorge Garrido
