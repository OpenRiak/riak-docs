Hi Roman,
I just set the IP to 0.0.0.0 as then it'll bind to whatever IPs are
available, even if they change.

Obviously you want to make sure your firewall isn't allowing random
internet addresses into the Riak ports, though.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; is there any way to specify in riak.conf in field "listener.http.$name‚Äù
&gt; FQDN instead of IP address?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;listener.http.$name This is the IP address and TCP port to which the
&gt; Riak HTTP interface will bind. {"127.0.0.1",8098}&lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; why is it required to use IP address instead of a host name? In my setting
&gt; RIAK\_KV is deployed on dynamic VMs and IP could be changed if the VM is
&gt; launched on a different hypervisor.
