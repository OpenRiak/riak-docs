Sorry about the late reply.

No, those messages simply mean that the process had a single garbage
collection event that took 57 milliseconds. If you're doing a lot of
work on a lot of data, then the default settings in the etc/app.config
file may be too low. Edit the riak\_sysmon section of that file and
revise the ceilings upward appropriately, particularly the gs\_ms\_limit
item, since that's the one that you might be seeing excessive
notifications. You may also want to change the heap\_word\_limit item,
also.
