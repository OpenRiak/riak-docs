Hi Zeeshan,

Actually, I was trying to make this harder than it really is. The easiest
way to do this appears to be simply ANDing the two values in the query
parms.

Thanks,
Michael Martin

&gt; Hello Michael,

&gt; You should be able to then set a field to be multiValued in your schema
&gt; that would capture your use-case. You can find more info here -&gt;

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I have a need to index on two separate fields in a json document - rather,
&gt; I need to concatenate the two and index on that.
&gt;
&gt; Short of duplicating both into a single new item in my json document, how
&gt; would I go about doing that?
&gt;
&gt; Example:
&gt;
&gt; Given this JSON:
&gt;
&gt; { "parent": "/path/to/parent",
&gt; "self": "myname"
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; How would I build a schema that would search on "/path/to/parent/myname"
&gt; without doing something like:
&gt;
&gt; { "parent": "/path/to/parent",
&gt; "self": "myname",
&gt; "fullpath": "/path/to/parent/myname"
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Michael Martin
