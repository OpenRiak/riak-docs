I had heard from a possibly unfounded source that creating over 1000
different secondary indexes could place a burden on cluster performance.
 Can anyone confirm that?

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; this question has probably been answered already, still I can't get to
&gt; it, so,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is the maximum number of unique secondary indexe keys a riak
&gt; cluster can manage before running into trouble?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thanks!
