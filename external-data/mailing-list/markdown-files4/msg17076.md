Hi!

Riak 2.1.3

Having a stable data set (no documents deleted in months) I'm receiving
inconsistent search results with Yokozuna. For example first query can
return num\_found: 3000 (correct), the same query repeated in next seconds
can return 2998, or 2995, then 3000 again. Similar inconsistency happens
when trying to receive data in pages (using start/rows options): sometimes
I get the same document twice (in different pages), sometimes some
documents are missing completely.

There are no errors or warning in Yokozuna logs. What should I look for in
order to debug the problem?

Thanks!
