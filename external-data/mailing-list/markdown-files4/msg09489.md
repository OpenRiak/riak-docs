&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt; I have a query regarding riak indexes. My current understanding is that
&gt; riak cannot index numbers whose representation needs more than 32 bits.
&gt; There is an issue on the basho repo to address this -
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/issues/112 . Do you have any
&gt; idea when it will be fixed ?
&gt;
&gt; I've mentioned a way to work around this problem on a comment on the
&gt; issue. The work-around would not be efficient since JS code would have to
&gt; go through N rows to drop ones that do not fit a particular criteria on the
&gt; number. If there is a better solution to the problem, I'd like to hear your
&gt; thoughts on that also.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your time.
&gt; -Deepak
