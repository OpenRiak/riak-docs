Hi Everyone,

I am building a new 5 node cluster with 1.3.0 and am transitioning from 
Bitcask to LevelDB (or perhaps a Mulit with LevelDB being the main) 
which is all well understood. My question is regarding image data, and 
other large binary data: Is one better than the other in terms of the 
size of binary data that can be stored, as well as performance of 
reads? I recall Mark suggesting to limit binary data to 10MB.


I am curious where this limitation comes from?

Thanks,
Bryan
