Without reading all the emails.. why can't you just cache the keys in an
object and maintain that list? The you could check against that list. This
way you don't have to go through every object in riak.

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt; Still a relative newbie here.
&gt;
&gt; I was hoping to be able to setup a MapReduce job that I could feed 1000
&gt; keys to, and have it tell me of the 1000, which keys exist in the bucket.
&gt; I was hoping this could use the key index (such a thing exists right?)
&gt; without having to read the objects.
&gt;
&gt; The methods I've tried for doing this fail when the first non-existing key
&gt; is found though.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a way to do this?
&gt;
&gt; Or alternatively, is there a way to check for the presence of one key at a
&gt; time without riak having to read the object?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
&gt; Tim.
