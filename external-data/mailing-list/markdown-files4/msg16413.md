If you know one node's HTTP listening port, you know them all -- all the
nodes are supposed to listen on the same ports. (Otherwise, load balancing
gets awkward, etc).

A case where different nodes in the cluster are listening on different
ports is exotic enough to not be worth supporting. (Plus, there's no way to
programmatically discover them from Go).

You can definitely discover the ip addresses of the other nodes via API,
though. But not the ports.

&gt; I am trying to find a way to pass in connection information for one of
&gt; the nodes in a cluster to an app I am writing in Go, and then
&gt; programmatically determine the addresses of the other nodes in the
&gt; cluster so I can connect to them and gather performance data. Assuming I
&gt; always use default ports, this isn't an issue, but I would like this to
&gt; work for non-default, unknown ports.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any suggestions!
