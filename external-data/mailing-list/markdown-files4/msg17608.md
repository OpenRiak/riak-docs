This command will show the handshake used for HTTPS. It will show if
the server's certificate (the same one used for TLS) can be validated.

Using "openssl s\_client" is a good way to start diagnosing what's
actually happening when SSL/TLS is enabled in Riak.

&gt; Kyle,
&gt;
&gt; I would be interested to see the output of this command run on the same 
&gt; server as your Riak node:
&gt;
&gt; openssl s\_client -debug -connect localhost:8098
&gt;
&gt; Please replace "8098" with the HTTPS port used in this configuration setting 
&gt; in your /etc/riak.conf file:
&gt;
&gt; listener.https.internal
