Hi,

I need to handle up to 5K writes per second at peak, with payload sizes
ranging from 10KB to 100KB.

I haven't done any benchmarks currently, but just as a high level is this
type of usage scenerio a good fit for Riak?

This will be a write heavy usage, and I will then push things to elastic
search/solr for further querying etc.

I ran into a few benchmarks and some of them were just a few hundred writes
per second for 1KB payloads, maybe these were old so that is why I am
asking.

Thanks.
