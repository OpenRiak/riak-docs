Thank You

Unfortunately "openSuSE" is not available on
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/downloads/ and there seems to be no "Riak"
repo in zypper as mentioned in
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/installing/suse/

Since I am very new to Riak and I'd like to try out some basic features, any
release would be fine to me. I read that the benefit of compiling the
sources are the "devnodes" that can be easily used and connected to a node
ring.
