What does "riak-admin transfers" tell you? Are there any transfers in progress?
You can try to set the amount of allowed transfers per host to 0 and
then back to 2 (the default) or whatever you want, in order to restart
any transfers which may be in progress. You can do that with the
"riak-admin transfer-limit " command.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; We have a prod cluster of four machines running riak (1.1.4 2012-06-19) 
&gt; Debian x86\_64.
&gt; Two days ago one of the servers went down because of a hardware failure.
&gt; I force-removed the machine in question to re-balance the cluster before 
&gt; adding the new machine.
&gt; Since then the cluster is operating properly, but I noticed some handoffs are 
&gt; stalled now.
&gt; I had similar situation awhile ago that was solved by simply forcing the 
&gt; handoffs, but this time the same approach didn't work.
&gt; Any ideas, solutions or just hints are greatly appreciated.
