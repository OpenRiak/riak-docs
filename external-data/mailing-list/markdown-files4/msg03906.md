As promised, I'll be posting the Recaps to the blog (in addition to
the mailing list, of course). More importantly, the RSS feed is
working and ready for a deluge of subscribers.


Thanks! I can confirm that the rss feed works nicely if you paste it 
into google reader where you can access it from either the web page or 
the phone app (and reading from either clears it from the unread messages).
