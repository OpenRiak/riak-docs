Alex,

This will remove the register from the map:

del obj.registers['something']
obj.store()

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; This is a pretty dumb question but I think I have never recalled doing it
&gt; before. Imagine that I have a register called "something" with a value:
&gt;
&gt; obj.registers['something'].assign('blah')
&gt;
&gt; If later on I want to remove this "something" register from the riak map
&gt; object, how to do it? I don't seem to find anywhere in the documentation
&gt; how to remove a register.
&gt;
&gt; I could set up an empty string: obj.registers['something'].assign(''), as
&gt; I see that when you fetch a register that doesn't exist it returns an empty
&gt; string instead of a None. Is this the only way? Or can we remove it in some
&gt; other way?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Alex
