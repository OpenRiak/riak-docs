Yes right, I was tired when I typed this; stats should be an array:

{"id": 1, "stats": [{ "name": "stat1", "value": 1 }, {"name": "stat2",
"value": 5}]}
{"id": 2, "stats": [{ "name": "stat3", "value": 2 }, {"name": "stat1",
"value": 3}]}
{"id": 3, "stats": [{ "name": "stat2", "value": 3 }, {"name": "stat3",
"value": 1}}]

I haven't tried it either, but I was worried that stats\_name = stat1 and
stats\_value &gt; 1 would return both ID 1 and 2 because both have a name
stats1 and both have some value &gt; 1.

&gt;
&gt; And the query would be something like
&gt;
&gt; Stats\_name = stat1 and stats\_value &gt; 1
&gt;
&gt; I think the extractor flattens everything and separates with underscores.

&gt; &gt; Hi All, I'm trying to determine if a use case is supported by Yokozuna
&gt; or not.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; With a stored value that looks like:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; {"id": 1, "stats": { "name": "stat1", "value": 1 }, {"name": "stat2",
&gt; "value": 5}}
&gt; &gt; {"id": 2, "stats": { "name": "stat3", "value": 2 }, {"name": "stat1",
&gt; "value": 3}}
&gt; &gt; {"id": 3, "stats": { "name": "stat2", "value": 3 }, {"name": "stat3",
&gt; "value": 1}}
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I want to find those who have stat1 &gt; 2. The result should be id 2.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe Solr 4.8 would handle this as a block-join, but I don't think
&gt; Yokozuna supports this feature. My first thought was a custom extractor;
&gt; are there other options I'm not seeing?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
