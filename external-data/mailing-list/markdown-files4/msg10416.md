Hey Aatish,

The only thing that comes to mind is that 8087 is already in use for
something else (I've done this N times)... but nothing else looks
suspect based on my hasty review.

Some entry level log file info can be found on our docs [1]. I would
start there and see if there's anything fishy.

Also, shameless plug - I was digging around sourcebits.com just now
(beautiful site, btw) and noticed that you're based in San Francisco.
If you happen to be local, you and your team should come to the Riak
Meetup tonight [2]. We can debug in person. :)

&gt; Hello everyone ,
&gt;
&gt; I'm relatively new to riak and am just in the process of exploring things
&gt; I seem to have this recurring problem thats an on again ..off again thing ..
&gt;
&gt; NOTE: This issue started after i tried setting up a mulit backend setup but
&gt; reverted back to this one for now
&gt;
&gt; Everytime i start a riak node(i clear all the data in /var/lib/riak/) and
&gt; try to perform a basic curl insertion on it ..
&gt;
&gt; curl -v -XPUT http://10.151.99.77:8087/riak/test/doc?returnbody=true
&gt; -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"bar":"baz"}'
&gt; (Taken from riaks tutorial)
&gt;
&gt; The command just seems to halt or not return .. it has this message till the
&gt; point it halts
&gt;
&gt; \* About to connect() to 10.151.99.77 port 8087 (#0)
&gt; \* Trying 10.151.93.77... connected
&gt; \* Connected to 10.151.93.77 (10.151.93.77) port 8087 (#0)
&gt;&gt; PUT /riak/test/doc?returnbody=true HTTP/1.1
&gt;&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.21.6 (x86\_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.21.6
&gt;&gt; OpenSSL/1.0.0e zlib/1.2.3.4 libidn/1.22 librtmp/2.3
&gt;&gt; Host: 10.151.93.77:8087
&gt;&gt; Accept: \*/\*
&gt;&gt; Content-Type: application/json
&gt;&gt; Content-Length: 13
&gt; my app.config is pretty basic with the exceptions .. - Changed port to 8087
&gt; - and i think this is default but the storage backend is {storage\_backend,
&gt; riak\_kv\_memory\_backend}
&gt;
&gt; and the vm.args has custom name with the ip of 10.151.99.77 ...
&gt; What i really want to know ..
&gt; - is there some logs i can see for the curl commands ?
&gt; - is there something im missing in the app.config ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; -Thanks ! :)
&gt;
