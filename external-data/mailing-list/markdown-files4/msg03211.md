I have a quick question regarding riak\_core:

 Basically I am trying to build an application on top of riak\_core that 
allows me to spawn a session per user interaction, so I can both hold state and 
queue requests to ensure ( as best I can ) that a user will only be interacting 
with my system in a serialised manner.

 My understandings are as follows with riak\_core:

 1. You obtain a list of possible vnodes that can serve your request 
based on a hash of a key which in my case is a user\_id
 2. You then use each of the vnodes in the list to execute your request 
which in my case is 1 as I have N=1.

 In my situation I want to kill a node ( simulate a failure ) send some 
further long running requests in that whose primary node is the one that has 
been killed, and then bring back up the dead node and send some more requests 
in with the safe knowledge that I will not end up with 2 vnodes ( primary 
and fallback ) that are processing the requests at the same time. Has anyone 
got any suggestions how I may achieve this? as I have scoured the riak\_core 
source code and can not find a way to test if a vnode is present on a primary 
and fallback node at the same time, or am I barking up the wrong tree and 
trying to achieve the unachievable.

 Also I know I can not protect from a spit brain using this approach, 
although this is okay as under these rare occasions I have plans to deal with 
this in the business logic of the App.
