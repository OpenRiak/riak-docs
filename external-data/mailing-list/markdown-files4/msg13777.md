Hi,

I’m testing on yokozuna api now, but found every time I call 
delete\_search\_index function it alerts cannot delete because of pre-existed 
associated bucket. I’ve tried to set the bucket search-index to another index, 
still have the same error.

Is this part not implemented yet? or is something I missed from?
