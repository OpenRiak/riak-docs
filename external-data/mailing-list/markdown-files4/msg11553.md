Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the right answer is doing a GET
first so you have a vector clock that is after the delete. Then you should
be able to be sure your new write wins in any sibling resolution.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Another posibility is to create a new bucket for each test run.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; Also a good idea, but not easily implemented against my current library.
&gt; I've
&gt; got a solution in using random addition to keys that works for now.
&gt;
&gt; My only problem is that this doesn't solve my underlying issues regarding
&gt; keys
&gt; disappearing. Is the only way to ensure keys don't disappear is to never
&gt; reuse a key? I'd understand if this was caused by two random processes
&gt; interacting, but in this case there is a significant (&gt;1s) time between two
&gt; runs where keys overlap.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for all the help,
