That should have been 14.5KB not MB.

&gt; I am seeing some odd behavior from the PBC Search API. When the search 
&gt; results get to be a certain size and the size changes depending on the 
&gt; client's location (over GB ethernet its around 14.5MB when I VPN in it 
&gt; appears to be much less; but I'll confirm that later) the returned byte array 
&gt; consists of the correct number of bytes but it contains a sequence of nil 
&gt; (0x0) bytes at the end, causing protocol buffers to blow up when trying to 
&gt; deserialize.
&gt; 
&gt; Curious if anyone else has seen this. The version of Riak was built off the 
&gt; master on Tuesday (7/3) and applied pull request 119 to riak\_search.
