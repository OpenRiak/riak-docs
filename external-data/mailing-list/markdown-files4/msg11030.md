Sharing a tip with the list, in case it saves a future person an hour of 
their time..


If you use Nginx to loadbalance to Riak CS, be sure that you set this in 
your site configuration:


 proxy\_set\_header Host $http\_host;

This ensures that the HTTP Host: header is passed through as it is 
received, rather than replaced by the IP address or hostname of the 
back-end server that nginx proxied the request to.


Also ensure that the domain name fully matches the one in 
/etc/riak-cs/app.config, and that you have wildcard DNS records 
configured against it.
