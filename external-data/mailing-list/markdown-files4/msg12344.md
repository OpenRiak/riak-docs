I did a PUT, and the vclock that came back was:
a85hYGBgzGDKBVIcypz/fgZJFylnMCUy5rEyNOdtOc2XBQA=

Then I read the object back, modified it, and PUT it again, providing the
old vclock, and got a new vclock:
a85hYGBgzGDKBVIcypz/fgZJFylnMCUy5bEyNOdtOc2XBQA=

(Notice they are slightly different: Uy5rEy -&gt; Uy5bEy)

Then, I did a DELETE, using the first vector clock, not the second, updated
one.

After that the object was gone, I could not find it in the database any
more.

Is this supposed to be like that - deleting an object providing a stale
vclock actually deletes it? Or am I probably doing something wrong?

Thanks,
Gints
