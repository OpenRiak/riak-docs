&gt; Hi,

&gt; When I run a curl -H "Accept: text/plain"
&gt; http://137.195.143.116:8098/stats command
&gt; I get three sets of nodes:connected\_nodes, ring\_members, ring\_ownership
&gt; that are not the same. One node is included in connected\_nodes but is not
&gt; included in ring\_members, ring\_ownership
&gt; What could be the reason?
&gt;

Long story short, you're in good shape. As long as "ring\_members" and
"ring\_ownership" are showing the same nodes, there is no need to worry.
 You might want to checkout Riaknostic [1] which has some code [2] that
lets you fix potential issues with node connectedness before they strike in
production.

"connected\_nodes" is the a list of the nodes connected via distributed
erlang [3], which may or may not include all of the Riak nodes. Suffice it
to says, it's less then clear what all of these mean, so I've opened up an
issues against the wiki to make sure we get it documented [4].
