Hi again,

I was just thinking about the problem with the out-of-date
listing/editing of bucket properties with the protocol buffers API,
and wondering: given the existing REST interface, wouldn't it be
relatively simple to offer a PB call which would offer editing/listing
of properties with a JSON payload? Besides bringing the PB interface
up-to-date with existing properties, this would likely make it
workable with a single code path, and thus reduce future pain in
maintaining it up-to-date.

Thoughts?
