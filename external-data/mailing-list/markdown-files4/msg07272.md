Another thing that I noticed:

 - /data directories aren't same size

/data directories in the cluster of (dev1, dev2, dev3) should be the same
size, right?

&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt;
&gt; Yesterday and today I've experienced anomaly in Riak DB.
&gt;
&gt; :list\_keys() is showing 2 keys. Each time I perform this it fetches two
&gt; keys but one of them is always different (different key, different value).
&gt; So, I guess there are three k/v stored in the DB.
&gt;
&gt; Before that, I had deleted /data directory from all nodes (dev1, dev2,
&gt; dev3) to clean the DB.
&gt;
&gt; I didn't change Riak nodes, the settings are identical with Fast Track
&gt; tutorial.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas to fix the problem?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
