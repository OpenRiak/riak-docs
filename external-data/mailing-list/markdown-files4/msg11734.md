Hi there

Trying to get a simple Riak Cluster configured on some VMs. I'm using
Ubuntu 12.04 and compiled Riak 1.4 from source. It will start up fine
when bound to 127.0.0.1 but after changing the IP in app.config and
vm.args it no longer starts.

The only output I get from Riak start is:

Node 'riak@192.168.123.10' not responding to pings.

I bet more (obviously) from riak console, this is in the Gist linked below.

All the relevant config files, console outputs and log files are here:

Looking at your app.config file I see a couple of lines like:

 {http, [ {"[[IP]]", 8098 } ]},

Is the "[IP]" you obfuscating your IP address or is that literally 
what's in the file? If that's what is in the file I don't think that 
will work. :-)


Unless I need to bind to a specific interface I usually use the 
"wildcard" IP "0.0.0.0" so that I can use the same config file on all my 
nodes. Then, the only place I need to be explicit with an IP is in the 
vm.args name variable.
