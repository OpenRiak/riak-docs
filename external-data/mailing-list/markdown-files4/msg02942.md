If we had this then a C-wrapper would be that much more attainable. So, the 
author of such a lib would be a superstar in my book :).

&gt; As such I'm just wondering if anyone knows of anyone working on a protocol

&gt; I'll have to take on.
&gt; 
&gt; I've found a few generic looking C++ projects that use Boost's asynchronous
