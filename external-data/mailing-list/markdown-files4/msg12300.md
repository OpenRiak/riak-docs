&gt; Is it possible to have Riak control running at HTTP port on localhost? 
&gt; Assuming security is provided by SSH tunnels.

Yes, this is possible if you disable the authentication. 

It will only redirect to SSL when the authentication is set to 'user list' 
instead of 'none' to ensure you don't expose credentials over an 
unencrypted channel.
