The problem you're running into is that Luwak will only store the information 
about a file that you tell it. Unless you make the luwak\_file aware of the 
file's metadata in the filesystem (through luwak\_file:set\_attribute), you're 
simply telling luwak to store the binary data that is read from disk. 

How file metadata is handled varies from filesystem to filesystem. On some UNIX 
filesystems, file metadata is stored in inodes. Inodes are pointers to the 
actual file on disk, but they also contain the file metadata.
