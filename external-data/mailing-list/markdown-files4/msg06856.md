Howdy Philip,

This behavior varies from client to client. When a client doesn't support load 
balancing, many people have taken to using HAProxy or nginx to spread the load 
across an entire cluster. I believe OJ Reeves wrote an article long ago about 
this very subject. You can find it over at 
http://buffered.io/posts/webmachine-erlydtl-and-riak-part-2/

I found another one over here: 
http://blog.dloh.org/Riak,-haproxy,-and-client-side-applications

I hope this helps!

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I've just created my first 3 node riak cluster and must admit that I'm
&gt; stunned! However, it seems like the RiakClient is missing a really
&gt; important functionality for HA software. AFAIK you can only specify a
&gt; single server. I want to host a large riak cluster and a frontend
&gt; cluster separately. Using a single server for connecting would be a
&gt; huge single point of failure.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I missing something?
&gt; 
&gt; It would be nice if it would be possible to specify multiple servers
&gt; and the clients automatically chooses a random server that's available
&gt; from this list.
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards
