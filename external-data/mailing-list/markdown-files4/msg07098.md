Bryan,

You'll need to enable Lager's parse transform. The easiest way to do that is to 
add the {parse\_transform, lager\_transform} to your compile options in 
rebar.config.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been using Lager for several months now to much success. One thing 
&gt; that I have not figured out though is how to get our output to match that of 
&gt; what the limited documentation claims. According to the blog post:
&gt; 
&gt; http://basho.com/blog/technical/2011/07/20/Introducing-Lager-A-New-Logging-Framework-for-ErlangOTP/
&gt; 
&gt; It states:
&gt; 
&gt; Now, those were messages coming out of error\_logger, which is fine for legacy 
&gt; or library code, but Lager also has its own logging API that you can 
&gt; use. It's actually implemented via a parse\_transform so that Lager can 
&gt; capture the current module, function, line number and pid for inclusion in 
&gt; the log message. All this is done automatically, and the logging call in the 
&gt; code looks like this:
&gt; 
&gt; lager:error("oh no!")
&gt; lager:warning("~s, ~s and ~s, oh my!"
