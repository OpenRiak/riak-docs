Hi,
Sorry to say that Maps are just riak objects underneath, so the same size limit 
applies. Anything over 1mb and you'll start to feel the pain.

Cheers

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm curious if anyone has had experience using maps as containers for
&gt; a large amount of data.
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any inherent size limits for maps? Could you put sets
&gt; equivalent to several gigabytes of data into one map? I'd also be
&gt; curious as to the performance impact of deleting said map. Would it be
&gt; the same impact as scanning keys in a bucket and deleting
&gt; sequentially?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm exploring using a map to organize data within a time bucket if you
&gt; will to get around the leveldb back-end not having TTL support.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!
