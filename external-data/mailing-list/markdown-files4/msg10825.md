Oops. Looks like this is a duplicate (thanks, Mailman).

Here's the current thread:

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I'm currently storing data in MongoDB and would like to evaluate Riak as an
&gt; alternative. Riak is appealing to me because LevelDB uses Snappy, so I would
&gt; expect it to take less disk space to store my data set than MongoDB which
&gt; does not use compression. However, when I benchmarked it by inserting a few
&gt; hundred thousand JSON records into each datastore, Riak in fact took far
&gt; more disk space. I'm wondering if there's something I might be missing here
&gt; as a newcomer to Riak. E.g. I checked the disk space used by running "du -ch
&gt; /var/lib/riak/leveldb". Is this perhaps not a good way to check disk space
&gt; usage because perhaps Riak/LevelDB preallocates files? (I know MongoDB does
&gt; this and has a built-in db.collection.stats command to provide true disk
&gt; usage information). Are there any other reasons why Riak might be taking
&gt; more space or anything I could have screwed up?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Ben
