Hi All,




I am a member of the community for about a year to understand reliability of
Riak. 

What I can see here is that there are some problems which could prevent 
using

it in a project which require high reliability. That's why I'd like to ask 
the following:




Do you believe that Riak can be used in a project which requires high 
reliability?




Thank you so much..




BR,

jh
