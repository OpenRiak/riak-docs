Thanks for this. I am going to check it out, and so should the others.

&gt; I'm stretching the legs on our new async framework Reactor [1] and I
&gt; created a quite small helper class to enable efficient async operation of
&gt; the official Java client. I'm calling it Riaktor (even though there's
&gt; apparently an old Ruby gem of the same name that hasn't been updated in
&gt; several years).
&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/jbrisbin/riaktor
&gt;
&gt; Since it uses Reactor, it also has OOTB Groovy love, which includes using
&gt; Closures as callbacks, etc… There's basically no documentation yet; only
&gt; what's in the tests. But if you're brave enough to try out something
&gt; completely new, I would love to get your feedback! :)
&gt;
&gt; I've load-tested this to over 150,000 ops/sec using 2 threads via
&gt; Disruptor-based RingBufferDispatchers. Reactor itself can do 15M ops/sec on
&gt; my three-year-old MacBook Pro so the bottleneck is going to be the network
&gt; and your Riak cluster. But assuming you've got the bandwidth to handle it,
&gt; Riaktor can push to (and pull from) Riak very efficiently.
&gt;
&gt; Once you've got some data in the client, the idea is that you'll want to
&gt; continue integrating with Reactor's async tools by doing compositions (map,
&gt; filter, reduce, etc… a la RxJava Observable). That's why Riaktor returns a
&gt; Promise for almost everything.
&gt;
&gt; I'd be interested to get your feedback as it would directly feed back into
&gt; better Reactor features.
