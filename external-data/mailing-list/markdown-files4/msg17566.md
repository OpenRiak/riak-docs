Vikram,

John Daily wrote a fantastic blog series that places your question in
context and then answers it.

&gt; Hi - I have a Riak node with n\_val=3, r=2, w=2 and have just one
&gt; key-object stored there-in. I'm trying to test various configurations to
&gt; better understand the system and have the following observations - some
&gt; dont seem to align with my understanding so far, so appreciate if someone
&gt; can throw some light please... Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; 1. n=3, r=2, w=2: Base state, 1 key-value pair.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Change to n=2, r=2, w=2: When I query from my client, I randomly see 1
&gt; or 2 values being fetched. In fact, the number of keys fetched is 1 or 2,
&gt; randomly changing each time the client queries the db. Ideally, I would
&gt; have expected that if we reduce the n\_val, there would be data loss from
&gt; one of the vnodes. And that for this scenario, I would still expect only 1
&gt; (remaining) key-value pair to be read from the remaining two vnodes that
&gt; has the data. Note that I dont intend to make such a change in production
&gt; as cognizant of the recommendation to never decrease the value of n, but
&gt; have done so only to test out the details.
&gt;
&gt; 3. Then change to n=2, r=1, w=1: I get the same alternating result as
&gt; above, i.e. 1 or 2 values being fetched.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Then change to n=1, r=1, w=1: I get 3 key-value pairs, all identical,
&gt; from the database. Again, are these all siblings?
