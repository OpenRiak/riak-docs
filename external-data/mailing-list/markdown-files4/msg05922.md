Yes, I am. This does not seem to be a timeout of the full map/reduce
operation, as it does not cause the m/r to fail -- rather certain
portions of the reduce phase fail so I get back semi-reduced results.

&gt; Are you sure you're using milliseconds[1] to specify the timeout?

&gt;&gt; I'm running a map/reduce operation with fairly complex map and reduce
&gt;&gt; phases against about 2000 keys. Each key also has a (fairly small)
&gt;&gt; payload arg. Currently just testing it locally against a single Riak
&gt;&gt; node. I've started consistently seeing this error during the reduce
&gt;&gt; phase:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; error:{case\_clause,{error,timeout}} reducing:
&gt;&gt; (then a dump of a bunch of the data for the phase)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The map/reduce itself has a timeout of 10 minutes, but this is
&gt;&gt; happening after about 30 seconds. Any idea what could be causing this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
