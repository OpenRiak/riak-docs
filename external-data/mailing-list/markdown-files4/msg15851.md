Hello Alexander,

I would definitely take a look at how much RAM each node has. You can adjust 
the max heap size in riak.conf by changing search.solr.jvm\_options max heap 
size values from -Xmx1g to -Xmx2g or more. I’d also take a look at 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/configs/search/#Solr-for-Operators
 
,
 which has links to Solr performance issues/factors and ways to monitor Solr.

You can get more statistical information for search by using `riak-admin stat 
show `. Our documentation of these statistics is still in progress, 
but you can see what’s available for search here: 
https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/develop/src/yz\_stat.erl#L92 
.

Thanks.

&gt; I not have stable reproduce but peaks happens several times in day and takes

&gt; some times it happens on very low traffic, so I think it not related on 
&gt; traffic.
&gt; Looks like query is locked somehow. 
&gt; What can I do for troubleshoot peaks? Enable addition logs or Monitoring ? 
&gt; There is no errors in logs at time of the peaks
