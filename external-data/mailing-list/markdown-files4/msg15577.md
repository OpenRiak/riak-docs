Hello everyone,

I have noticed that in latest documentation on Riak data types 
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/theory/concepts/crdts/#Counters 
), for 
Counters it is not recommended to use them for ordered IDs (UUIDs). Can I 
implement g-counters (as described in the CRDT paper) using Riakâ€™s Set 
datatype? I am wondering whether that will work out well for my use case. 

What I would like to do is to have synchronization of sequence numbers between 
multiple src processes that send their inputs to a single centralized process. 
I want all the sequence numbers to be unique so that the centralized process 
can create an ordering of the input messages based on the sequence numbers. 
Thus I would have an integer entry for each src process in the set, and the sum 
of all the integers would be my unique id. After the src process writes a value 
to the DHT for its corresponding entry, would it then have to read the value 
from the DHT in order to make sure it got committed without conflicts?
