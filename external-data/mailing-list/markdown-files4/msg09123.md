This Microsoft blog post gives a sample how to query the SQL Server
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlphp/archive/2012/06/08/introducing-the-microsoft-driver-for-node-js-for-sql-server.aspx

In the record loop, you use a Riak Node driver like riak-js.

I can't share the scripts I wrote due to work but I can answer anything you
may have outside of providing the code.

Thanks,
Jeff

&gt; There is nothing that I have come across. What I did in the past was run a
&gt; quick Node.js app that pulled data out of SQL Server using one of the
&gt; available drivers and serialize and write to Riak. It is not perfect, and
&gt; may be slow depending on the amount of data but it does work.\*\*\*\*

&gt; I would like some scripts or programming tools that I could use to
&gt; transfer existing data held in Microsoft SQL Server databases into Riak. Do
&gt; such tools exist?\*\*\*\*
