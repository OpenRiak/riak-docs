Hi all,

Just a quick reminder to all from Basho EMEA. We've got a \*Basho Office 
Hours\* event running tomorrow!


If you're able to get to our offices on: 61 Rivington Street, London, 
EC2A 3QQ.You'll be rewarded with coffee and a slice of pizza, then ask 
our Basho London engineers anything you like. It's an informal event 
where you can drop in whenever you like throughout the day.

Cheers,

Chris
