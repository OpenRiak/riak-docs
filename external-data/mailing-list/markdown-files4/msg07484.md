I see, so I must have cleared the properties out somewhere along the way
(although I'm not sure what ring files are, or how I would clear them).
Thank you for the feedback, I will keep an eye on this to make sure I
understand it completely!

Cheers
Steve

&gt; Any bucket properties you set via the client interfaces are stored in the
&gt; ring structure and should persist independent of any data in the cluster.
&gt; Be careful that when you are clearing session data that you are not also
&gt; clearing the ring files.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; I have configured Riak to store sessions in a separate bitcask backend
&gt;&gt; which has an expiration set. What I observe though is that when all
&gt;&gt; sessions are expired (overnight), the properties I set on the bucket revert
&gt;&gt; to the default bucket properties. Is there a way to make these bucket
&gt;&gt; properties permanent without making them the default for the entire cluster?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Regards
