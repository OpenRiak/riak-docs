Riak Recap for May 02 - 03
====================

1) Version 0.4.1.1 of MailRank's Haskell client was just tagged.

Repo here ---&gt; https://github.com/mailrank/riak-haskell-client

2) Bradley Taylor posted a photo of some hardware he and Webster/Clay
just picked up for their Riak test cluster.

\* You'll want to look at this ---&gt;

3) Stephan Seidt (@evilhackerdude) released a nifty bit of code
yesterday (while at JSConf) that watches & syncs folders into a riak
bucket.

\* Repo here on GitHub ---&gt; https://github.com/evilhackerdude/teriaki

Thanks, Stephan!

4) We merged a great chunk of code for riak\_core from the team at Evax
that adds a standard OTP-style handle\_info callback for vnode modules
to receive arbitrary messages from other processes.

\* Initial pull request ---&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/pull/49/
\* Actual commit details ---&gt;
https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/commit/9df3f22d75e0022bdf9fcbf2baae937e29c3f6b6

Thanks!

5) Sean Cribbs posted the slides from his talk yesterday at JSConf.

\* Check them out here ---&gt; https://github.com/seancribbs/riak-apps-jsconf2011

(In case it's not obvious, he was serving these slides directly from
Riak during the preso.)

5.1) For anyone in Portland, Sean's preso at NodeConf on Riak-js is
happening tomorrow at 4:00.

\* Details somewhere on this page ---&gt; http://nodeconf.com/schedule.html

6) Basho is hiring a Product Marketing Manager.
