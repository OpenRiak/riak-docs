&gt; Longer answer: Riak gave users the option of client or \_vnode\_ ids in version

&gt; 
&gt; I am curious as to how that was accomplished when using vnode version 
&gt; vectors. As section 3.2 of the paper mentions, the node with concurrent 
&gt; updates could detect they are concurrent and it could reject the update, but 
&gt; how could you encode the causal history using the version vectors so as to 
&gt; generate a sibling? That section ends with a statement saying no such 
&gt; version vector could be generated.

The paper is correct. A sibling is generated when no such causal history can be 
discovered. If a causal history is found, there's no need for a sibling. In 
short, a sibling is a way to keep both values, this side-stepping the even 
worse scenario of rejecting (losing) a write.

&gt; Presumably Riak implemented a version vector that is somewhat different from 
&gt; that described in the paper?
