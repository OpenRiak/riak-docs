&gt; Hello
&gt;
&gt; I've been looking at moving a mongo cluster to use riak.
&gt;
&gt; I have a question: how do people install riak?
&gt; I tried using the latest chef recipe from basho on an ubuntu 12.04 machine,
&gt; but with no luck.
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-chef-cookbook/issues/93

I replied to your ticket (which I \*think\* may be tied to an IRC
discussion we had yesterday). We can continue the discussion on there
so that people running into the same error can easily find a solution.

&gt; What's the best way to install/maintain riak? One of the main reasons we
&gt; have for moving away from mongo is that it is such a pain to maintain. (E.g.
&gt; adding new nodes to the cluster.)
&gt; I hope it's easier in riak!
&gt;

To answer your question on how people install Riak:

- 73% of last quarter's Riak community survey participants said they
use Basho provided packages
- Of those who automate the installation: 38% (Chef), 25% (Puppet),
21% (Other), 13% (Ansible), 1% (Salt)

For Riak CS, 75% use Basho packages, 67% (Chef) and 33% (Ansible).
