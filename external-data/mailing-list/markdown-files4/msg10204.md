Given iostat says ~10% utilization, I would suggest increasing the
concurrency of your writes. It's obviously not using up the capacity
of the disk, your bottleneck is elsewhere. 2MB/sec is low for any
commodity hardware.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm micro-testing a simple update pattern (key + short json document) on my
&gt; local workstation (8 core intel CPU, 8 gig of RAM, 10K disk) to get baseline
&gt; before moving to cluster on AWS. With Riak I get about 60 mods/s before
&gt; maxing out (as compared to approx 3000 mods/s on a vanilla MySQL using
&gt; exactly the same code).
&gt;
&gt; It feels like I must be doing something hideously wrong. (For the record,
&gt; I'm a decent Java programmer but a riak/erlang n00b).
&gt;
&gt; Riak is installed via a vanilla Ununtu 12.04 package as described in the
&gt; docs. The test ran on the same disk as the mentioned MySQL test. The same
&gt; Java code was doing both tests (just a DAO swapped).
&gt;
&gt; The bucket was using n\_val = 1.
&gt;
&gt; The problem seems to be in high disk-writing, despite the low load. Here's
&gt; what iostat says during the run:
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt; wrqm/s : 434.50
&gt; w/s: 182.90
&gt; wkB/s: 2618.00
&gt; avgrq-sz: 28.63
&gt; [...]
&gt; %util: 10.60
&gt;
&gt; Which seems to be too much considering the small load (the stored JSON blobs
&gt; are roughly 1K each).
&gt;
&gt; I'm using the official PB Java client.
&gt;
&gt; This is an evaluation for a customer. Any hint of what I'm missing or what
&gt; the problem could be would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
