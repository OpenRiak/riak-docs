&gt; I am trying to run some Java client benchmark testing with Basho Bench by
&gt; following the Riak document:
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/appendices/Java-Client-Benchmark/
&gt; 
&gt; The Basho Bench tool configuration file for this need requires Jinterface
&gt; node, see below:
&gt; 
&gt; %% The list of remote Java client nodes you want to bench.
&gt; %% Each entry is a tupple of the format
&gt; %% {node(), inet:ip4\_address(), inet:port\_number()}
&gt; %% Were host is the Jinterface node and
&gt; %% ip and port form the address of the
&gt; %% Riak interface that Java client should call
&gt; 
&gt; {riakc\_java\_nodes, [{'java@127.0.0.1', {127,0,0,1}, 10018}]}.
&gt; 
&gt; And I don't see the Riak online documentation has some description about
&gt; Jinterface node. If you have information about the document pages or the
&gt; procedures to create Jinterface node, it would be highly appreciated.

Poor as it is, old and unmaintained, here is the README for the bench\_shim that 
is mentioned on the page you linked too.

https://github.com/basho/bench\_shim

The bench\_shim is a JInterface wrapper for the RJC. I don't know if it works 
with the current version of the client though.
