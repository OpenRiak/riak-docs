Hi Evan,

Thanks for the suggestions!

I did not think that raising that limit was normal. Glad to have confirmation.

I'll go through the logs again, and run 'riak-admin top ...' the next time it 
happens.

Dave,

If you're seeing the process count go that high, it suggests to me
that something else is wrong. Typically, even for heavily loaded
clusters, hundreds of thousands of processes isn't normal. Is there
anything else in the logs?

When a node sees this sort of behavior start, does riak-admin top
-sort msg\_q look like?

&gt; Hello,

&gt; I have run into a situation whereby I started seeing:
&gt;
&gt; [error] emulator Too many processes
&gt;
&gt; when some of our new jobs ran. These jobs are in perl using Net::Riak,
&gt; communicating to the cluster via PBC. They fire tens of thousands of fetchs
&gt; and stores over the course of about 20 minutes.
&gt;
&gt; Our cluster has five nodes with 1.3, using eLevelDB.
&gt;
&gt; I have been raising the limit (+P in vm.args) in increments from the default
&gt; of 32768. Currently at 524288, and that is still not high enough.
&gt;
&gt; Have any of you had to increase this limit?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
