I wasn't commenting that one should disable it, just that the option is there. 
I think it depends on your operational needs, namely the latency between the 
clients and Riak.

&gt;&gt; You can disable Nagle on the riak side (at least on 0.14 and later). Put

&gt; 
&gt; Shouldn't that be the default if clients are able to cache connections? 
&gt; You'll normally get the delay if your protocol isn't a strict serial 
&gt; handshake and you need to send a small packet with data already outstanding 
&gt; (like at the end of a request where the socket isn't being closed).
