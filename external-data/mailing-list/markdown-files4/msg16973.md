Hi everyone,

I'm using riak-cs in a distributed cluster and i'm trying to clone the
cluster to another that needs to be identical. The case is that I need to
put the same key to the user admin in the cloned cluster after riak has been
installed.

So, my question is very simple: is there a way to modify the key of the user
admin after is created?

Thanks at all!! 

Diego Mart√≠nez.
