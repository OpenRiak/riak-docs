 Happy Eunit day everyone! 

Hot on the heels of this week's webinar [1] on Riak and Python, I'm happy to 
announce a fresh release of the Python client for Riak, now at version 1.3.0 
[2], which includes several new features as outlined in the webinar. Most 
noteworthy features are support for the Solr interface Riak Search provides, 
support for Luwak, an in-memory test server, and support for caching protocol 
buffers and reusing/pooling HTTP connections. To give each new feature the 
attention it deserves I summed up the most noteworthy changes in a blog post. 
For a list of changes, please consult the release notes [4].
