Pandiarajan,

Can you please answer some questions for me:

 1. What is your application architecture? Are you consuming CI as a
 transport from WCF or are you calling CI from a RESTful server?
 2. Prior to adding CI, how were you talking to Riak?
 3. Have you ran basho\_bench against your application before and after
 implementing CI? Can you please share your results?

Thanks.
OJ

&gt; Hi Everyone,\*\*\*\*
&gt;
&gt; I am using Corrugated Iron(CI) for Riak in my
&gt; WCF REST application. After adding CI, the web services started to send
&gt; response very slow. All immediate consecutive request to the REST end
&gt; points get queued up and the responses are delayed more. If anyone has
&gt; implemented CI in the WCF project. Please advise me how to fix this issue.
