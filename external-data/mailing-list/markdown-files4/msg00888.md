I am having a situation where buckets gets created dynamically and I want to
attach post commit hook to it. Since it is part of bucket properties, how to
deal with when I set bucket properties? Since bucket is kind of virtual and
got deleted when no documents in it and created when first document is put.
Is there a way to find out when first time bucket is created? If I know, I
can attach once post hook properties. Or is that part of app.config and can
be set as part of config properties?
Please provide your thoughts.
