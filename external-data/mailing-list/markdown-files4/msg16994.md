Awesome, that's what I was looking for, thank you!

&gt; Weixi,

&gt; Are you using 2.0.0 or another 2.0.\* version?
&gt;
&gt; If you look at
&gt; https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/2.0.0/priv/default\_schema.xml#L104,
&gt; sets are not stored in the default schema, as they can get large. They’re
&gt; indexed for search, but will not return in the result-set. In 2.0.7 and in
&gt; 2.1.3, the default schema was changed to store them. If you modify the
&gt; existing default schema you have (stored=true), reload the schema, and
&gt; reindex, you’ll see the results.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.

&gt; I have a CRDT Map bucket that I'm running searches on in Yokozuna (using
&gt; \_yz\_default index for now)
&gt;
&gt; However, the search results do not return any fields of the map that are
&gt; CRDT sets. Is this intended behavior?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!
