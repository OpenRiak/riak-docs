&gt; Thaaaaaaaaaaat's really interesting. I've also noticed that the sharp

&gt; Is there any chance that your input rate to leveldb / riak increased after 
&gt; upgrading to 1.2.1? I am not asking if you intentionally increased the input 
&gt; (write) rate, but if it happen to go up due to the changes in Riak and 
&gt; leveldb. 
&gt; 
&gt; I ask because 5x increase just happens to match the fact that 1.1 had ONE 
&gt; compaction thread and 1.2.1 has FIVE compaction threads (ok, more than five 
&gt; actually … but only five active at any one time). But this increased number 
&gt; of threads would only have a 5x increase for a short transition period unless 
&gt; 1.2.1 also happened to allow more data to flow into the system from your 
&gt; applications.

&gt; Dietrich,

&gt; I can make two guesses into the increased disk writes. But I am also willing 
&gt; to review your actual LOG files to isolate root cause. If you could run the 
&gt; following and post the resulting file from one server, I will review it over 
&gt; the weekend or early next week:
&gt; 
&gt; sort /var/lib/riak/leveldb/\*/LOG &gt;LOG.all
&gt; 
&gt; The file will compress well. And no need to stop the server, just gather the 
&gt; LOG data live.
&gt; 
&gt; Guess 1: your data is in a transition phase. 1.1 used 2 Megabyte files 
&gt; exclusively. 1.2 is resizing the files to much larger sizes during a 
&gt; compaction. You could be seeing a larger number of files than usual 
&gt; participating in each compaction as the file sizes change. While this is 
&gt; possible, I have doubts … hence this is a guess.
&gt; 
&gt; Guess 2: I increased the various leveldb file sizes to reduce the number of 
&gt; open and closes, both for writes and random reads. This helped latencies in 
&gt; both the compactions and random reads. Any compaction in 1.2 is likely to 
&gt; reread and write larger total number of bytes. While this is possible, I 
&gt; again have doubts … the number of read operations should also go up if this 
&gt; guess is correct. Your read operations have not increased. This guess might 
&gt; still be valid if the read operations were satisfied by the Linux memory data 
&gt; cache. I do not how those would be counted or not counted.

&gt;&gt; Will check on that.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Can you think of anything that would explain the 5x increase in disk writes 
&gt;&gt; we are seeing with the same workload?

&gt;&gt; Look for any activity in the LOG. Level-0 "creations" are fast and not 
&gt;&gt; typically relevant. You would be most interested in LOG lines containing 
&gt;&gt; "Compacting" (start) and "Compacted" (end). The time in between will 
&gt;&gt; throttle. The idea is that these compaction events can pile up, one after 
&gt;&gt; another and multiple overlapping. It is these heavy times where the 
&gt;&gt; throttle saves the user experience.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks. The amortized stalls may very well describe what we are seeing. If 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I combine leveldb logs from all partitions on one of the upgraded nodes 
&gt;&gt;&gt; what should I look for in terms of compaction activity to verify this?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dietrich,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I can see your concern with the write IOS statistic. Let me comment on the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; easy question first: block\_size.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; The block\_size parameter in 1.1 was not getting passed to leveldb from the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; erlang layer. You were using a 4096 byte block parameter no matter what 
&gt;&gt;&gt; you typed in the app.config. The block\_size is used by leveldb as a 
&gt;&gt;&gt; threshold. Once you accumulate enough data above that threshold, the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; current block is written to disk and a new one started. If you have 10k 
&gt;&gt;&gt; data values, your get one data item per block and its size is ~10k. If you 
&gt;&gt;&gt; have 1k data values, you get about four per block and the block is about 4k.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; We recommend 4k blocks to help read performance. The entire block has to 
&gt;&gt;&gt; run through decompression and potentially CRC calculation when it comes off 
&gt;&gt;&gt; the disk. That CPU time really kills any disk performance gains by having 
&gt;&gt;&gt; larger blocks. Ok, that might change in 1.3 as we enable hardware CRC … 
&gt;&gt;&gt; but only if you have "verify\_checksums, true" in app.config.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Back to performance: I have not seen the change your graph details when 
&gt;&gt;&gt; testing with SAS drives under moderate load. I am only today starting 
&gt;&gt;&gt; qualification tests with SSD drives.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; But my 1.2 and 1.3 tests focus on drive / Riak saturation. 1.1 has the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; nasty tendency to stall (intentionally) when we saturate the write side of 
&gt;&gt;&gt; leveldb, . The stall was measured in seconds or even minutes in 1.1. 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.2.1 has a write throttle that forecasts leveldb's stall state and 
&gt;&gt;&gt; incrementally slows the individual writes to prevent the stalls. Maybe 
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is what is being seen in the graph. The only way to know for sure is 
&gt;&gt;&gt; to get an dump of your leveldb LOG files, combined them, then compare 
&gt;&gt;&gt; compaction activity to your graph.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Write stalls are detailed here: 
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://basho.com/blog/technical/2012/10/30/leveldb-in-riak-1p2/
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; How can I better assist you at this point?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We've just gone through the process of upgrading two riak clusters from 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.1 to 1.2.1. Both are on the leveldb backend backed by RAID0'd SSDs. The 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; process has gone smoothly and we see that latencies as measured at the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gen\_fsm level are largely unaffected.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, we are seeing some troubling disk statistics and I'm looking for 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an explanation before we upgrade the remainder of our nodes. The source of 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the worry seems to be a huge amplification in the number of writes 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; serviced by the disk which may be the cause of rising io wait times.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My first thought was that this could be due to some leveldb tuning in 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.2.1 which increases file sizes per the release notes 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md). But nodes 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that were upgraded yesterday are still showing this symptom. I would have 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expected any block re-writing to have subsided by now.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Next hypothesis has to do with block size overriding in app.config. In 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.1, we had specified custom block sizes of 256k. We removed this prior to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upgrading to 1.2.1 at the advice of #riak since block size configuration 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was ignored prior to 1.2 ('"block\_size" parameter within app.config for 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leveldb was ignored. This parameter is now properly passed to leveldb.' 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak/commit/f12596c221a9d942cc23d8e4fd83c9ca46e02105).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if the block size parameter really was being passed to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leveldb, and having removed it, blocks are now being rewritten to a new 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; size, perhaps different from what they were being written as before 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/commit/ad192ee775b2f5a68430d230c0999a2caabd1155)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is the output of the following script showing the increased writes to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disk (https://gist.github.com/37319a8ed2679bb8b21d)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --an upgraded 1.2.1 node--
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read ios: 238406742
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write ios: 4814320281
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read/write ratio: .04952033
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; avg wait: .10712340
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read wait: .49174364
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write wait: .42695475
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --a node still running 1.1--
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read ios: 267770032
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write ios: 944170656
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read/write ratio: .28360342
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; avg wait: .34237204
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; read wait: .47222371
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; write wait: 1.83283749
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And here's what munin is showing us in terms of avg io wait times.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any thoughts on what might explain this?
