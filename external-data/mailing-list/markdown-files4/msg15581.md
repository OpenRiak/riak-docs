Hi everyone!

I have a riak cluster, working in production for about one year, with the 
following characteristics:
- Version 1.4.8
- 6 nodes
- leveldb backend
- replication (n) = 3
~ 3 billion keys

My ssd's are reaching 85% of capacity and we have decided to buy 6 more nodes 
to expand the cluster. 

Have you got any kind of advice on executing this operation or should I just 
follow the documentation on adding new nodes to a cluster?

Best regards!
Edgar
