&gt;&gt; I tried lmdb in an iOS project recently and while it is indeed fast i also
&gt; did run into several issues. I needed something seriously faster than SQLite
&gt; and after some experimentation ended up embedding leveldb in stead.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1. When storing objects larger than the page size (default is 4k) then
&gt;&gt; those
&gt; pages are not taken from the free list (since they need to be consecutive) but
&gt; always adds to the file size. This means you can easily run out of space.
&gt; 
&gt; That restriction was removed a few months ago. (December 2012)
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2. The fact that it can only have one write transaction open means that
&gt;&gt; you
&gt; have to be very careful in not causing serious lock congestion.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So in my experience it only makes sense to use in a read-heavy application 
&gt;&gt; with mostly small values.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, LMDB is designed for read-heavy applications.
