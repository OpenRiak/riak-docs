Hi,

Is it possible to downsample a table as part of a query? Specifically, to
group and aggregate a given table's records at a less granular level than
the rows are stored in the table using an aggregation technique. Most time
series databases offer a way to either precompute (reindex) at different
granularities or query with an aggregation function. I haven't found
anything like GROUP BY time(1h) in the docs. Am I missing something?

Thanks,
Jordan
