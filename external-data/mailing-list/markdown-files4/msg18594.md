Dear All,
In order to be in time for the start of Code Beam SF 2019, we are launching the 
Release Candidate for Riak CS 2.1.2 based on 
https://github.com/basho/riak\_cs/pull/1351
Owing to the long amount of time that Riak CS has been dormant to development, 
we seem to be having a time lag getting the pull request approved. The 
development has been happening at 
https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak\_cs/tree/2.1.2rc2 with the 2.1.2rc2 tag being 
the current state of development on the 2.1 branch.

Brief summary of features:

 \* OSS/EE Integration - all EE code has been migrated into the OSS version 
and references to EE have been removed from the code for simplicity going 
forwards. This gives proxy\_get and Superclusters to all open source users\*.
 \* Experimental signature\_v4 support - a long time complaint about CS is 
that it only supports signature\_v2. Although the code for v4 is not complete 
(see issues in release notes), it worked perfectly well with our tests.
 \* Multi-version KV support - this version of Riak CS has been tested 
against Riak KV 2.1.4 (EE), Riak KV 2.2.6 and Riak KV 2.9.0rc2 following the 
tests outlined in https://github.com/basho/riak\_cs/tree/develop/riak\_test where 
all tests passed except the three tests that require compatibility with 
obsolete versions of Riak KV 1.x and CS 1.x.
 \* Bug fixes and improvements

\* For Riak KV users prior to Riak KV 2.2.6, proxy\_get and Superclusters are 
restricted to Enterprise Edition versions of Riak KV as the previously 
Enterprise Edition only replication function is required for proxy\_get and 
Superclusters to work.

Documentation
Other than the new toggle in riak-cs.conf to enable signature\_v4 support, all 
documentation is identical to that of Riak CS 2.1.1 Enterprise Edition 
https://docs.riak.com/riak/cs/2.1.1/

Packages have been created for the same operating systems as KV and can be 
found at:
Riak CS https://files.tiot.jp/riak/cs/2.1/2.1.2rc2/
Stanchion https://files.tiot.jp/riak/stanchion/2.1/2.1.1/

Riak CS requires one Stanchion node in the cluster to function properly. Some 
modern OS did not have Stanchion packages available, so those have been built 
too.

Please test accordingly and file any issues in GitHub.

Best regards,

Nicholas
