Daniel, 

When you do a bucket list you are actually listing all keys in 1/N partitions 
and extracting the bucket names from the keys(which are bucket++key). So, when 
you remove all the keys in a bucket you effectively remove the bucket because 
no keys in the keylist will return as being members of that bucket.

&gt; I know buckets are only prefixes for keys so in theory bucket does not know 
&gt; if it's empty (or maybe it does) but to me it looks like only buckets with 
&gt; keys are visible.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any purging mechanism in Riak to remove unused buckets?
