Thanks for your reply.

We are. We sort of expected an anomaly in the object size, but there was none. 
We found the root cause. It was a large number of additions to a single set. 
It’s not clear to me which metric reveals that problem, but it appears as 
though object size doesn’t.

&gt; Hi Alex -
&gt; 
&gt; Are you monitoring any of Riak's statistics? Specifically object size
&gt; and sibling count, though all of the stats are useful.

&gt;&gt; We have a 5 node Riak cluster running 2.1.1. This morning FSM Time (99th

&gt;&gt; nodes. Once we started with an empty DB, the FSM Time normalized. But now 
&gt;&gt; it's headed back up again. We're stumped on how to trouble shoot this issue. 
&gt;&gt; Any suggestions?
