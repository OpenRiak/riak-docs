Hi, Alek.

&gt; What kind of protocol is used betwwen Riak nodes to communicate. Because if 
&gt; all Riak nodes are located in the same cluster (LAN network scale) there is 
&gt; no problem.
&gt; But when Riak nodes are located on different clusters which are connected 
&gt; through Internet, there are some limitations. Because some ISPs only allow 
&gt; communicating by HTTP and SMTP protocol and I am wondering how Riak nodes can 
&gt; communicate over the Internet.

Within a single Riak cluster, nodes communicate with each other using the 
Erlang distribution protocol. There are a number of reasons within Riak's 
design -- this just being one of them -- why spreading a Riak cluster across a 
wide area is not recommended.

The Riak Enterprise system (http://basho.com/products/riak-overview/) uses an 
entirely different protocol for managing long-haul communication, and also uses 
a different methodology. In that system we do not spread a single cluster 
widely, but rather create a topology of one cluster per datacenter, with each 
of those connected to each other.
