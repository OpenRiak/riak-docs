&gt; Just sorting out the logistics of this meeting with Russell - it's going
&gt; to be done over Skype. We need to grab an email address from those who are
&gt; wanting to join in, so we can send out the invite.
&gt;
&gt; As mentioned before, bet365 are keen to get Riak building on OTP20, as are
&gt; a few others. The more users / orgs that we can get on-board, the better
&gt; for discussion, decisions etc.
&gt;
&gt; Please reply with your address and we'll get it sent out.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks

&gt;
&gt; Just to echo what had been said on Slack already, myself and others from
&gt; bet365 will be joining. Definitely on-board with getting the project to a
&gt; current OTP version. Had started to look at some of the work - so it's
&gt; going to be useful to get consensus on things such as the desire to remain
&gt; backwards compatible etc.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks

&gt;
&gt; It \_really\_ needs doing. And a whole host of people have said they’re keen
&gt; to work on it.
&gt;
&gt; Ted Burghart did a lot of work on this at Basho (talk here:
&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcUTsYjEon4) and of course Heinz Gies has
&gt; made riak\_core\_ng available for some time.
&gt;
&gt; At least 3 organisations have expressed a willingness to do the work, and
&gt; as much as I hate meetings, I think we need to talk to get organised to get
&gt; this done, rather than each org/individual attacking alone.
&gt;
&gt; I hate Wednesdays almost as much as I hate meetings, so how does 1700 GMT,
&gt; Wednesday 7th February sound?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
&gt; Russell
