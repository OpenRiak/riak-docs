Hi Ayush,

Just so I'm clear and can reproduce this:

\* You were using Riak 1.4 and had Riak Search enabled.
\* You put some data into this environment.
\* You then upgraded to 2.0.1 and saw the search hook being added to buckets.

Thanks!

&gt; You are right. This is just a workaround not a fix. I had some urgency in my
&gt; project. That's why I followed this approach. I updated it from previous
&gt; version to 2.0.1.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Ayush

&gt;&gt; Hi Ayush,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; By making that change, you are enabling Riak Search 1.0, which I
&gt;&gt; assume you don't want to do. This is a "workaround" but not a fix.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; \* Did you upgrade from a previous version of Riak to 2.0.1?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; \* What client library and version of that library are you using?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; \* Can you run this command and send me the output? tar czf
&gt;&gt; /tmp/riak-config-$(hostname).tgz /var/lib/riak/generated.configs
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
