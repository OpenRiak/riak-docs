Thanks a lot, Jeremiah! Your answers really help clarify the issues.

Just one more question, by "document-based indices", do you mean
document-based partitioning for the indices? Because what I found in the
online document
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/search/#Search-KV-and-MapReduceis
"Search
uses term-based partitioning â€“ also known as a global index." I am not sure
if the implementation has changed for the latest version of Riak, but if
term-based partitioning is used, does that mean Riak will only schedule the
mappers after the whole list of  pair is returned from the
index?

Thanks,
Xiaoming

&gt;&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am trying to learn about Riak MapReduce and comparing it with Hadoop
&gt;&gt; MapReduce, and there are some details that I am interested in but not
&gt;&gt; covered in the online documents. So hopefully we can get some help here
&gt;&gt; about the following questions? Thanks in advance!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; They're not at all similar. Hadoop MR is optimized for sequential data
&gt; processing in large batches. Riak MR works better when you think of it like
&gt; a multi-processing engine - you can perform work across a matching set of
&gt; items and that work will be distributed across the cluster during map
&gt; phases.
&gt;
&gt; Take a look at this thread for a bit of discussion about when you should
&gt; use Riak MapReduce: http://markmail.org/message/qpoilvmm635inb5v
&gt;
&gt; Or, if you want to, you can run a Riak MR job across an entire bucket,
&gt; which really is like scanning every table in an RDBMS while looking for
&gt; rows from a single table. MR jobs run with an R of 1. So, at least there's
&gt; that.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. For a given MapReduce request (or to say, job), how does Riak decide
&gt;&gt; how
&gt;&gt; many mappers to use for the job? For example, if I have 8 nodes and my
&gt;&gt; data
&gt;&gt; are distributed across all nodes with an "N" value of 2, will I have 4
&gt;&gt; mappers running on 4 nodes concurrently? Is it possible to have multiple
&gt;&gt; mappers (e.g., 4 or even 6) for the same MR job running on each node (for
&gt;&gt; better processing speed)?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; To the best of my recollection, this will be based on either:
&gt;
&gt; 1) If you're using JavaScript MR jobs, the number of mappers and reducers
&gt; is controlled by the the map\_js\_vm\_count and reduce\_js\_vm\_count settings
&gt; from each node's app.config file.
&gt; 2) If you're using Erlang: magic. This will be handled by the Erlang VM
&gt; and is based on number of processors and your overall Erlang VM
&gt; configuration.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2. If I run a MapReduce job over the results of a Riak Search query, how
&gt;&gt; does Riak schedule the mappers based on the search results?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Riak Search uses document-based indices - search will query every node in
&gt; the cluster. Map phases happen and then results are then streamed to the
&gt; reducer.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3. How does Riak handle intermediate data generated by mappers?
&gt;&gt; Specifically:
&gt;&gt; (1) In Hadoop MapReduce, the output of mappers are  pairs, and
&gt;&gt; the output from all mappers are first grouped based on keys, and then
&gt;&gt; handed
&gt;&gt; over to the reducer. Does Riak do similar grouping of intermediate data?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The only reason for the intermediate grouping/scratch work in Hadoop MR
&gt; jobs is to deal with multiple reducers. Although, I'm not entirely sure how
&gt; this works in Riak, my suspicion is that data is streamed across the wire
&gt; after the data is read from disk.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (2) How are mapper outputs transmitted to the reducer? Does Riak use local
&gt;&gt; disks on the mapper nodes or reducer nodes to store the intermediate data
&gt;&gt; temporarily?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Since large MR jobs can cause out of memory errors, you can bet good money
&gt; that the answer is "no".
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4. According to the document
&gt;&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/mapreduce/#How-Phases-Work,
&gt;&gt; each MR job only schedules one reducer, which runs on the coordinate node.
&gt;&gt; Is there any way to configure a MR job to use multiple reducers?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Using Riak MR, there's no way to create a job that runs reducers on
&gt; multiple nodes. You can have multiple reducer processes on a single node,
&gt; but not reducers on multiple nodes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best regards,
&gt;&gt; Xiaoming
