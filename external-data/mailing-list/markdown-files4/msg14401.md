Try port 10017 instead. 10018 is usually the HTTP port for the dev1 devrel node.

Thanks,

&gt; Hello there
&gt; sorry to bother you guys with this totally noob question...
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to run the tutorial "Tast of Riak" in eclipse. I have a cluster
&gt; running made of 3 joined dev-nodes, from which I can get the stats via
&gt; browser. The "all in one client" jar is referenced by the java project.
&gt; 
&gt; However I receive a "java.io.EOFException" when trying to fetch any bucket:
&gt; 
&gt; Bucket myBucket = client.fetchBucket("test").execute();
&gt; 
&gt; (as far I know they should be created/managed automatically when not
&gt; existing)
&gt; 
&gt; Since the exception occures at this line, I assume that the connection
&gt; itself was successfully established:
&gt; 
&gt; IRiakClient client = RiakFactory.pbcClient("127.0.0.1", 10018);
&gt; 
&gt; I set up (and started) Riak under root, while I am working in KDE with
&gt; another user. Could this cause the problem?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Roger
