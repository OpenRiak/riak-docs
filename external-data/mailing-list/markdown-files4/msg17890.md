Riak CS stores data chunks in bitcask and the index/metadata file in leveldb. 
Bitcask, as noted, has no compression. When you force Riak to use level for the 
data chunks you get compression for that data which may or may not be good for 
your use case. If it's not good for your use case I believe you can turn level 
compression off.
