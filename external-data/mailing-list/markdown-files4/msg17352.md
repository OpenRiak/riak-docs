Nobody knows if there is a way to access SOLR right away without going
through RIAK's interface?

Thanks,

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; If I want to create a Disco cluster [ http://discoproject.org ] to build
&gt; statistics and compile data attacking Riak's SOLR directly without using
&gt; Riak, how can I do it?
&gt;
&gt; In this way, I would leave Riak mainly for data IO (post/get) and leave
&gt; the heavy duty of searching and compiling data to Disco; so Riak's
&gt; performance shouldn't be affected for searching as mainly it will store and
&gt; retrieve data only.
&gt;
