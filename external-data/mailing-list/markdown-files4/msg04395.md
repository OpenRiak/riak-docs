Riak Recap for August 17 - 18
=======================

1) 0.3.7 of riakc was just released.

\* Here on PyPI ---&gt; http://pypi.python.org/pypi/riakc/0.3.7

2) Adrian Hills wrote a great blog post all about getting started with
Riak and .NET. Thanks, Adrian!

4) Canvas Hosting launched dedicated Riak hosting today. You'll
probably want to take a look at this. Also, congrats to @schaapy,
@bendingoutward, and the rest of the team at Canvas working on this.

\* Details here ---&gt; http://canvashosting.com/solutions/riak

5) We announced the September Bay Area Riak Meetup today. This one is
happening on 9/8 and will feature Basho DA Dan Reverri giving an
extensive overview of Riak 1.0/ short talk from Craigh Muth about
integrating Riak into the Xiki Framework. (And for those of you in
NYC: don't be surprised if you get your own Riak 1.0 Preview
Meetup...)

\* Details here ---&gt;

6) Riak is taking over the next Seattle Scalability Meetup happening
on 8/24. Greg Perkins from clipboard.com will talking about how they
use Riak and Riak Search, and yours truly will be covering the Riak
basics. (And if you're in Seattle and want to grab a beer, let me
know.)

\* Details and registration here ---&gt;

7) Rick Olson (@technoweenie) released the code for a URL shortener
they pushed into production at GitHub this week. Rumor has it that
it's backed by Riak. Thanks, Rick!

\* Repo for "Guillotine" here ---&gt; https://github.com/technoweenie/guillotine

8) Q - Is there any way to automatically have riak start up, and join
the cluster? (via #riak)

 A - There is nothing built into Riak to make this happen at the
moment, but it is something that could be scripted fairly easily. Keep
in mind that the decision to add a node should be a based on detailed
capacity planning.
