When you start basho\_bench, you must start Erlang in distributed mode,
which means you must set a node name, and a cookie.

So, it would look something like the following: "./basho\_bench -N
foo@127.0.0.1 -C basho\_bench examples/riakc\_pb\_distributed.config"

Ensure that in examples/riakc\_pb\_distributed.config, remote nodes is
set to a list of nodese that passwordless SSH can connect to.

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt;
&gt; I am very new to Riak and I am trying to run some benchmarks for our cluster
&gt;
&gt; I saw this blog post about running basho bench distributed to be able to get
&gt; high throughput.
&gt; https://medium.com/@mustwin/benchmarking-riak-bfee93493419
&gt;
&gt; I also found the example config that can run in distributed mode, but when I
&gt; try to run it:
&gt;
&gt; ./basho\_bench examples/riakc\_pb\_distributed.config, I get the message:
&gt; "Basho bench not started in distributed mode, and distribute\_work = true"
&gt;
&gt; Is there some documentation no how to run basho bench distributed?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Mohamed
