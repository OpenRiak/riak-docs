&gt; Hi everybody!
&gt;
&gt; I've read in the "basic-mapreduce.txt" doc file that it is necessary to
&gt; reload the map/reduces functions in the riak node if they change, and "The
&gt; easiest way to reload a module on a Riak node is to get a Riak client, then
&gt; call Client:reload\_all(Module).".
&gt;
&gt; so, while developping a map function , i was using this call to reload it
&gt; in my riak node (I was using one node).
&gt;
&gt; But I noticed some curious behaviour:
&gt;
&gt; If I perfortm the map using a first version of the map function, lets call
&gt; it v1, of course I'll get a list of results. and when I modify the function
&gt; to an other version, lets call it v2, reload it in teh riak node as
&gt; recommended above (using Client:reload\_all(Module)) and performe again the
&gt; map. Some elements of the new list are the result get using the v2 version
&gt; but the other ones remains the results got using the v1 version.
&gt;
&gt; so I guess thet the nes map function was not correctly reloaded. what is
&gt; the matter?
&gt;
&gt; NB: when I restart the riak node, it works perfectly of course
