Riak Recap for Dec. 1 - 2

1) J. Brisbin added some instructions for working with Riak to the
Spring Data project README on GitHub.

Repo here ---&gt; https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-keyvalue

On Twitter here ---&gt; http://twitter.com/j\_brisbin/statuses/10463427432546304

2) Not long after we announced Riak Fuction Contrib
(contrib.basho.com) Daniel Einspanjer contributed his "Stats Function
Object."

&gt;From the description: "This is a function object that can be used to
generate commonly useful statistics on an array of numbers passed in."

Check it out here ---&gt; http://contrib.basho.com/stats.html

Thanks, Daniel!

3) aphyr and seancribbs had a very short conversation in #riak that
answered the question, "Is there a way to get results from multiple
phases into the same reduce phase?"
