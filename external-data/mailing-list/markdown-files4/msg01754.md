David,

It's expected that, especially when running basho\_bench, your cluster will not 
use that much CPU. Riak is mostly I/O-bound, which is a good thing (vs. wasting 
CPU not delivering data to you). I would definitely expect network and disk 
(and possibly RAM) to be the primary limiting factors.

&gt; and it seems to make no difference. Is this expected?

&gt; Also are there any suggested tuning parameters that should be used when

&gt; the bottleneck to be in a cluster? ( cpu / disk io/ memory / network io )
