Hi José,

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Suppose I have two objects O1 and O2, with O1 having a link (say tag is
&gt; watches) to O2. What is the proper way to delete O2? Should I just delete
&gt; O2 and then leave the link inconsistent until I find out and fix it? Or
&gt; should I always check whether that object has links to it and clean them up
&gt; before deleting the object. Please advise
&gt;

There's no real issue if you leave a link dangling to an object that you've
deleted. The two things to be aware of:

\* there will be some extra metadata on the object
\* if you walk the link to the non-existant object it'll return a 404.
