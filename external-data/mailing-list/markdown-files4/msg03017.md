Thanks Morten, having the logs (including the numbers) will help us debug
what's going on.

&gt; &gt;&gt; (We're running on a four-node cluster with NFS-based storage.)
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just have to know.. why is NFS involved?
&gt;
&gt; My company's standard setup is currently based on huge NFS-based SANs
&gt; and lots'o'blades. If we can re-use that setup for Riak, things get
&gt; quite a lot cheaper for us...
&gt;
&gt; (As to the logs, It's mainly the error message and tonnes of these
&gt; numbers. I'll post the full log when I get to work tomorrow...)
