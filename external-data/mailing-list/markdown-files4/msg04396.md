Regarding point 8, last I saw, various community members are working on
automating the process for nodes to start up and join a cluster.\*

&gt; Riak Recap for August 17 - 18
&gt; =======================
&gt;
&gt; 1) 0.3.7 of riakc was just released.
&gt;
&gt; \* Here on PyPI ---&gt; http://pypi.python.org/pypi/riakc/0.3.7
&gt;
&gt; 2) Adrian Hills wrote a great blog post all about getting started with
&gt; Riak and .NET. Thanks, Adrian!
&gt;
&gt; \* Read here ---&gt;

&gt;
&gt; 3) Forgot to send this one along a few days back... Mariano Peck wrote
&gt; up a blog post about using Riak and Fuel. Thanks, Mariano!
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; 4) Canvas Hosting launched dedicated Riak hosting today. You'll
&gt; probably want to take a look at this. Also, congrats to @schaapy,
&gt; @bendingoutward, and the rest of the team at Canvas working on this.
&gt;
&gt; \* Details here ---&gt; http://canvashosting.com/solutions/riak
&gt;
&gt; 5) We announced the September Bay Area Riak Meetup today. This one is
&gt; happening on 9/8 and will feature Basho DA Dan Reverri giving an
&gt; extensive overview of Riak 1.0/ short talk from Craigh Muth about
&gt; integrating Riak into the Xiki Framework. (And for those of you in
&gt; NYC: don't be surprised if you get your own Riak 1.0 Preview
&gt; Meetup...)
&gt;
&gt; \* Details here ---&gt;
&gt; http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Riak-Meetup/events/30127311/
&gt;
&gt; 6) Riak is taking over the next Seattle Scalability Meetup happening
&gt; on 8/24. Greg Perkins from clipboard.com will talking about how they
&gt; use Riak and Riak Search, and yours truly will be covering the Riak
&gt; basics. (And if you're in Seattle and want to grab a beer, let me
&gt; know.)
&gt;
&gt; \* Details and registration here ---&gt;
&gt; http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Hadoop-HBase-NoSQL-Meetup/events/20756731/
&gt;
&gt; 7) Rick Olson (@technoweenie) released the code for a URL shortener
&gt; they pushed into production at GitHub this week. Rumor has it that
&gt; it's backed by Riak. Thanks, Rick!
&gt;
&gt; \* Repo for "Guillotine" here ---&gt;
&gt; https://github.com/technoweenie/guillotine
&gt;
&gt; 8) Q - Is there any way to automatically have riak start up, and join
&gt; the cluster? (via #riak)
&gt;
&gt; A - There is nothing built into Riak to make this happen at the
&gt; moment, but it is something that could be scripted fairly easily. Keep
&gt; in mind that the decision to add a node should be a based on detailed
&gt; capacity planning.
