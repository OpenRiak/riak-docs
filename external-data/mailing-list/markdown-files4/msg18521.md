Hi,

I have installed RC2 (thanks to Nicholas' rpms) on one of our rings (5 boxes, 
heavy continuous read, heavy continuous write, centos7, bitcask, expiration, no 
compaction), and everything is running smoothly (same metrics as before, no 
errors so far). The only minor user experience issue was 
https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/940

&gt; Dear All,
&gt; We have placed a basic set of package builds online at 
&gt; https://files.tiot.jp/riak/kv/2.2/2.2.5rc2/ 
&gt; These builds were very simply a clone, checkout, make locked-all and 
&gt; make package locked-all so should provide the same functionality as 
&gt; building Riak 2.2.5rc2 from source.
&gt; Good luck and please share your feedback.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards,
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; More update.
&gt; 
&gt; There were some minor changes that missed the rc1, so we added them
&gt; 
&gt; \* yokozuna/746: [remove -XX:+UseStringCache]
&gt; (https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/pull/746)
&gt; \* yokozuna/747: [Remove jvm directive from test too]
&gt; (https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/pull/747)
&gt; \* riak\_repl/782: [Change ETS queue table permissions to protected]
&gt; (https://github.com/basho/riak\_repl/pull/782)
&gt; 
&gt; And today tagged RC2 (riak-2.2.5rc2)
&gt; 
&gt; Same rules as before:
&gt; 
&gt; At this point I DID NOT tag all the dependencies so it is \_VERY 
&gt; IMPORTANT\_ that the rebar.config.lock file is used when you build a 
&gt; release to test (e.g. `make locked-all`)
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone (Tiot? ESL?) can/wants to build packages please post to this 
&gt; list about location for those who'd rather test against packages.
&gt; 
&gt; We've got perf test results upcoming, and then we'll tag final.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your patience, almost there now.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; 
&gt; Russell

&gt; &gt; Will keep you updated.
