Hello everyone,
Can someone share a blog post or some notes about setting up riak production 
cluster at rackspace (RHEL 5)? I was wondering if there is some additional 
steps, best practices etc. when installing from source. Any additional 
information to help us get started would be much appreciated. We did read 
though most of Basho documentation about installing riak, just wondering if 
there are things that are specific to production setups.

Thank you.

iouri
