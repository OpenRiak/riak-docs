The maintainer no longer works at Basho, but I believe he does work at
Mesosphere now, so it might be worth reaching out to him.

&gt; Getting riak running in DC/OS was great - nice an easy with good

&gt; But I'm having an issue with the riak-mesos-director
&gt; (https://github.com/basho-labs/riak-mesos-director)
&gt;
&gt; I opened an issue on this repo but it looks like the maintainer doesn't work
&gt; for basho?
&gt;
&gt; Anyway it seems the new datatypes in riak (sets, counters, hlls) don't work
&gt; through the director.
&gt;
&gt; I assume its a pretty easy fix, so I just wanted to bring it to the
&gt; attention of someone at basho
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
