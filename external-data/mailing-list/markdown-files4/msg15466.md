Nirav,

You will have to GET and PUT every object to index it into Solr.

&gt; Hi Luke,
&gt;
&gt; Let me rephrase it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 1. We currently have 2i based searches in our code. We are trying to move it
&gt; to Solr as per Bashoâ€™s recommendation
&gt;
&gt; 2. To achieve this we created Solr schema. But when we tried it in dev, we
&gt; noticed Solr indexes only gets created for the new data and not for existing
&gt; data (captured prior to enabling Solr search)
&gt;
&gt; 3. To be able to implement Solr search successfully, we need to make sure
&gt; that Solr indexes existing data in current RIAK bucket.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Nirav

&gt; Hi Nirav,
&gt;
&gt; If I'm reading your description correctly - you'd like your secondary
&gt; index data to be automatically migrated to Riak Search?

&gt;&gt; "I have a production database which is fairly large and uses Secondary

&gt;&gt; Search(SOLR). Can someone please let me know if Active Anti-Entropy will
&gt;&gt; take care of ensuring that all the existing data that i currently have in
&gt;&gt; Production will be automatically synced up once i move to RIAK Search and
&gt;&gt; i
&gt;&gt; should be able to search on those fields. If not, is there any
&gt;&gt; configuration/Settings that can help me achieve this? "
