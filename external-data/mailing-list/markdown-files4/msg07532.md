&gt; When I watch 'top', beam.smp seems to be using up 0.01 second of the cpu

Riak does several things periodically, including gossip the ring,
checking for handoff and checking for fallback vnodes with data in them.

Basicially this is riak trying to keep your data safe. Maybe other
databases don't do this, but they also may not have the same data
resiliancy that Riak does.
