Thanks Sean. Makes sense. Are there any external tools available to
"optimize" innostore? - like the "OPTIMIZE" statement on innodb in
MySQL?

&gt; Sorry we missed this question.
&gt;
&gt; Innostore stores its data in a B-tree which expands and contracts according 
&gt; to the keys you have stored. So yes, when you delete keys, it should reduce 
&gt; the amount of used space. But innostore also pads the tree to keep it 
&gt; balanced and capable of adding new keys into the middle, so there will be 
&gt; some wasted space and small numbers of deletions won't greatly affect the 
&gt; used storage.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How does innostore deal with key deletions? will it automatically
&gt;&gt; shrink in size relative to the amount of keys deleted? if not, is
&gt;&gt; there an optimize/compact function somewhere for that?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Colin
