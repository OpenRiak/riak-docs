&gt; There is now a second update available for 2.9.0:
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak/tree/riak-2.9.0p2.
&gt; 
&gt; This patch, like the patch before, resolves a memory management issue in
&gt; leveled, which this time could be triggered by sending many large objects
&gt; in a short period of time. The underlying problem is described a bit
&gt; further here https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/issues/285, and is
&gt; resolved by leveled working more sympathetically with the beam binary
&gt; memory management.
&gt; 
&gt; Switching to the patched version is not urgent unless you are using the
&gt; leveled backend, and may send a large number of large objects in a burst.
&gt; 
&gt; Updated packages are available (thanks to Nick Adams at TI Tokyo) -

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again to the testing team at the NHS Spine project, Aaron Gibbon

&gt; 
&gt; Bryan,
&gt; 
&gt; We saw that Riak was using much more memory than was expected at the end of
&gt; the handoffs. Using `riak-admin top` we could see that this wasn't process
&gt; memory, but binaries. Firstly did some work via attach looping over
&gt; processes and running GC to confirm that this wasn't a failure to collect
&gt; garbage - the references to memory were real. Then did a bit of work in
&gt; attach writing some functions to analyse process\_info/2 for each process
&gt; (looking at binary and memory), and discovered that there were penciller
&gt; processes that had lots of references to lots of large binaries (and this
&gt; accounted for all the unexpected memory use), and where the penciller was
&gt; the only process with a reference to the binary. This made no sense
&gt; initially as the penciller should only have small binaries (metadata).
&gt; Then looked at the running state of the penciller processes and could see
&gt; no large binaries in the state, but could see that a lot of the active keys
&gt; in the penciller were keys that were known to have large object values (but
&gt; small amounts of metadata) - and that the size of the object values were
&gt; the same as the size of the binary references found on the penciller
&gt; process via process\_info/2..
&gt; 
&gt; I then recalled the first part of this:
&gt; https://dieswaytoofast.blogspot.com/2012/12/erlang-binaries-and-garbage-collection.html.
&gt; It was obvious that in extracting the metadata the beam was naturally
&gt; retaining a reference to the whole binary, as long as the sub-binary was
&gt; retained by the a process (the Penciller). Forcing a binary copy resolved
&gt; this referencing issue. It was nice that the same tools used to detect the
&gt; issue, made it quite easy to write a test to confirm resolution -
&gt; https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled/blob/master/test/end\_to\_end/riak\_SUITE.erl#L1214-L1239
&gt; .
&gt; 
&gt; The memory leak section of Fred Herbert's http://www.erlang-in-anger.com/ is
&gt; great reading for helping with these types of issues.

&gt; Good job on finding and fixing so fast.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to ask. What's with the naming scheme? Why not 2.9.2 instead of 
&gt; 2.9.0p2?
