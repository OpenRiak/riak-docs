Over the last few weeks I've been finding it harder and harder to start
riak which given that it's running on an auto-provisioned ec2 instance is
a bit of an issue! I can generally restart it by running
/etc/init.d/riak restart but it's got to the stage where I have to run
it four or five times. I should clarify here that when I say "harder to
start" it does start but as soon as I try to do anything it fails.

The contents of /var/log/riak are here:
