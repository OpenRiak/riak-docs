Hi Mav,

I opened the following issue to continue investigation:

https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/issues/1541

That would be the best place to continue discussion. I'll find time to
reproduce what you have reported.

Thanks -

&gt; I set up a bucket type called test-bucket-type. I did NOT set data type.
&gt; I set the hooks
&gt; Ran your curl -X PUT. The Hook was not called. Tried several times, no luck
&gt; I changed the curl to hit my non-typed bucket, and the commit hook hit
&gt;
&gt; $ riak-admin bucket-type list
&gt; default (active)
&gt; test-bucket-type (active)
&gt; sets (active)
&gt; maps (active)
&gt; counters (active)
&gt;
&gt; I made sure the hooks are applied
&gt; Also note there is \*\*no\*\* data type associated
