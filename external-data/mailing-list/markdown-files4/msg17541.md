Hello Friends,

For your reading enjoyment this weekend we have a number of announcements
and the delectably effervescent list review.

As always, we want to hear from you. Let me know if you’re working on or
speaking about something Riak related and would like a mention. I’ll try to
get your talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap. I know a guy.


## Announcements

 Riak TS 1.3.1 has been made available and is a bug fix release, get it
 while it’s hot. [0][1].

## Recently Answered


 -

 Kyle Nguyen writes in with a question on programmatically creating Riak
 KV bucket types [20]. Luke Bakken mentions that unfortunately that is not
 supported in the API however for those who are looking for that feature you
 are encouraged to support it here in this github issue [21].
 -

 Luke Bakken confirms Henrik Johanssons concerns that Riak will no longer
 be supported on Solaris/OmniOS/Illumos in future releases [22]. Having said
 that, the community is invited to package Riak for their platform of choice
 [23].
 -

 Vikram Lalit brings to our attention a failure scenario when running
 Riak on low powered VM’s [24]. Matthew Von-Maszewski points out a simple
 recovery [25] and identifies additional configuration parameters [26] which
 will allow you to develop/test against Riak running in low memory/low CPU
 environments.
 -

 Henning Verbeek opens a github issue [27] regarding an
 io.netty.util.concurrent.BlockingOperationException he is seeing in the
 Riak Java Client [28].
 -

 Adam Winter starts a lengthy conversation on Docker support for Riak
 [29]. In short, Riak on Docker is doable [30][31], there are concerns, and
 we don’t officially support it… yet.




## Open Discussions


 -

 Jubin Juneja is looking for help updating a an index with a new schema
 [32].

 queues within Riak [33].

 Michael Gnatz may have found a bug in Riak TS, Gordon Guthrie asks
 Michael to file a bug report [34].

 Guido Medina is looking for word on an updated Java client library that
 supports Netty-4.1.x [35].
 -

 Norman Khine is interested in running Riak on Amazon’s recently released
 Elastic File System (EFS) [36]. As it's brand new and no one has used it in
 production yet, I’d venture to say time will tell... along with vigorous
 testing.
 -

 Humberto Rodriguez is having some trouble getting Riak TS running on OSX
 due to naming related issue. Magnus Kessler tries to help him out [37].
