Hi Darshan,

Riak's memory requirements don't lend it to use on embedded devices.
Which device are you targeting?

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I am new to Riak and I would like to know steps to cross compile Riak for
&gt; Embedded Unit.
&gt; From website I found steps to compile with source code but I need steps to
&gt; cross compile.
&gt; It will be appreciated if you can give steps or links from which I can get
&gt; idea to cross compile.
&gt;
&gt; Thanking in advance,
