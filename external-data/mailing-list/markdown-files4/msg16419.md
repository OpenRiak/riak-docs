I should have mentioned, the actual Riak.conf has nodename set to the FQDN.
The FQDN resolves correctly in our DNS.

&gt;
&gt; However, as far as I can see, the host does have a fully-qualified
&gt; hostname:
&gt;
&gt; root@db04:/# hostname
&gt; db04
&gt; root@db04:/# hostname -f
&gt; db04.dc.sdlocal.net
&gt;
&gt; /etc/hosts contains a line with both the short and fqdn names in it.
&gt;
&gt; Is there something else I should be checking?
