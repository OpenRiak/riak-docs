Thank you. So, does that mean that no redistribution of data would occur unless 
the node is manually removed?

&gt; When a node is no longer responding a process called hinted handoff[1] takes 
&gt; over and ensure that your N (replication) value is met by allowing other 
&gt; nodes to temporarily take responsibility for the vnodes of the downed node. 
&gt; This node can return to the cluster and will resume operations for the vnodes 
&gt; it’s primarily responsible for or you could remove the node[2] from the 
&gt; cluster which would redistribute the primary responsibly among the remaining 
&gt; nodes. I’d also give our docs on replication[3] a look for more information.

&gt;&gt; Is there a description of what happens internally when a node goes down? I 
&gt;&gt; am curious if any there would be any sort of reshuffling or redistribution 
&gt;&gt; of data in the remaining vnodes? Or would the node simply be unavailable 
&gt;&gt; until restarted? 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
