Dear Riak Users,

Last week we have released Riak TS 1.5.2, which is available in both OSS
and EE editions. It is a bugfix release, no new features or incompatible
changes. As always, we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version.
Please see Release Notes [1] for details. Additionally, our friends at AWS
posted the updated AMI image (based on the latest Amazon Linux) at [2].
