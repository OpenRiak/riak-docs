If you really want an S3 API layer around NFS, I suspect you'd be better off 
taking the code from Riak CS and creating your own solution than attempting 
this approach.

One example of how this would run into trouble: if any server fails, nearly 
every large object would be unavailable because of the N=1 replication factor. 
The data itself would be available via NFS, but the server that's supposed to 
serve up those chunks wouldn't.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I want to try the following setup for a cloud-storage project :
&gt; 
&gt; - a cluster of x86 servers with SAS drives running Riak CS
&gt; 
&gt; - the replication for the metadata will be Nx3 on the servers running Riak
&gt; 
&gt; - data for the objects will be stored on a NFS shared storage (SONAS 
&gt; probably) with no replication configured on Riak (Nx1). The NFS platform will 
&gt; handle data protection instead in the backend.
&gt; 
&gt; I found a similar setup in MezeoCloud.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think about this ?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Adrian.
