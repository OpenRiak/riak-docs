&gt; Hi Michael,

&gt; I believe that you are seeing this error because the `cs\_root\_host`
&gt; Riak CS configuration option and `:host` (in the script's
&gt; configuration map) are not the same. Once you update `cs\_root\_host`,
&gt; make sure that you restart Riak CS for the changes to take effect.

Hi Michael,

Another alternative is to configure proxy\_port and proxy\_host in your Fog 
connection setup to point to your Riak CS instance, and use the default host of 
RiakCS which is s3.amazonaws.com.

The reason this is failing is because the host is used to generate the HMAC 
which authenticates each request.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

- Chris
