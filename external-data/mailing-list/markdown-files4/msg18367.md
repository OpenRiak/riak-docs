Hello,

Basho Technologies, founded in 2008, has developed over the years a 
cutting-edge suite of distributed computing products under the Riak name 
distributed as open source under the Apache 2 license.

Unfortunately, Basho Technologies seems to have closed their doors with 
investors and founders engaged in a court battle.

https://www.law360.com/articles/917913/basho-suit-stays-on-course-despite-defense-counsel-chaos

Now many Riak users, both corporate and individual developers, are under a 
great cloud of uncertainty as to what they can and can't do in terms of using 
and or forking the code and use of the Riak trademark.

So, questions:

-- Are there any legal issues with regard to continued use and development of 
Riak products?

-- Should the community choose to fork the products, what legal issues are 
involved?

-- Can users use the trademark and if so, under what constraints?

-- If Basho Technologies is legally dissolved, what happens to the license 
ownership?

-- Any other questions/issues we should be aware of?

Many thanks,

Lloyd R.Prentice
