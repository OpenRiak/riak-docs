Drew, 

That message is normal and is a result of handoff throttling done with the 
riak-admin transfer\_limit setting. When you say nodes are silently dropping off 
what do you mean? Is the beam.smp process shutting down or are they just never 
finishing this handoff?

Thanks,
Brian

&gt; So I'm having a recurring problem where members of my cluster silently drop

&gt; This looks like it is related to handoff\_concurrency.
&gt; 
&gt; After seeing a large number of log messages like:
&gt; An outbound handoff of partition riak\_kv\_vnode 
&gt; 79925870791533753339264014289171727637433810944 was terminated for reason: 
&gt; {shutdown,max\_concurrency}
&gt; The node silently fails and the only log messages I see after that point are 
&gt; AAE throttle ones.
&gt; Perhaps killing these outbound handoffs is permanently consuming a resource?
