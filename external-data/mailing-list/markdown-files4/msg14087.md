Jie,

4G ram is small for your ring size and node count. My first recommendation is 
that you reduce your ring size to 32 {ring\_creation\_size, 32}. Then change the 
max\_open\_files setting of eleveldb to 40 {max\_open\_files, 50} and block\_size to 
32768 {sst\_block\_size, 32768}. These three settings should quickly improve 
performance â€¦ but require you start over with your cluster.

Active Anti-Entropy has a bug in 1.4.7. You might as well disable it too: 
{anti\_entropy, {off, []}}. The recommendation is that you upgrade to 1.4.8.

Matthew

&gt; I also have a problem in performance test of Riak Cluster.
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; Riak version: 1.4.7
&gt; OS: openSUSE 11.3
&gt; RAM: 4G
&gt; ring size is 64
&gt; backend: leveldb
&gt; Nodes in cluster: 6 nodes
&gt; 
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; 
&gt; I write a key/value with value is 1K bytes, and 25 concurrent threads on one 
&gt; client nodes. The test result only 20 ops/s performance. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any performance benchmark to compare with?

&gt; Hi Matthew -
&gt; 
&gt; Some suggestions:
&gt; 
&gt; \* Upgrade to Riak 1.4.8
&gt; 
&gt; \* Test with a ring size of 64
&gt; 
&gt; \* Use staggered merge windows in your cluster 
&gt; (http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/bitcask/)
&gt; 
&gt; \* Since you're on dedicated hardware RAID, use the noop scheduler for your 
&gt; Riak data volumes:
&gt; 
&gt; cat /sys/block/sd\*/queue/scheduler
&gt; noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]
&gt; 
&gt; \* Increase +zdbbl in /etc/riak/vm.args to 96000
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

&gt; I have a persistent issue I am trying to diagnose. In our use of Riak we have 
&gt; multiple data creators writing into a 7 node cluster. The value size is a bit 
&gt; large at around 2MB. The behavior I am seeing is that if I delete all data 
&gt; out of bitcask, then test performance I get fast writes. As I keep doing the 
&gt; same work of writing to the cluster, then the Riak write times will start 
&gt; tailing off and getting really bad.
&gt; 
&gt; Initial write times seen by my application: 0.5 seconds for 100MB worth of 
&gt; values (~200MB/s)
&gt; Subsequent write times: 11 seconds for 100MB worth of values (~9MB/s)
&gt; 
&gt; This slow down can happen over roughly 20-40 minutes of writing or about 
&gt; 200GB worth of key/value pairs written.
&gt; 
&gt; I can reset the cluster to get fast performance again by stopping Riak and 
&gt; deleting the bitcask directories, then starting Riak again. This step is not 
&gt; feasible for production, but during testing at least the write speed goes up 
&gt; by 20x.
&gt; 
&gt; Watching iostat I see that every few seconds the disk io jumps to ~11%. It 
&gt; doesn't seem that highly loaded from my cursory look. Watching top I see that 
&gt; beam.smp runs at around 100 for CPU% or less when heavily loaded. I am not 
&gt; sure how to tell what it is doing though :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any suggestions!!
