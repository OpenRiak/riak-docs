Okay, good to know this is a known issue. I attached the
logs for the last time this occurred in my original email.

I'll try to capture this information if the problem occurs again.
Thanks.

Best Regards,

Armon Dadgar

&gt; Hi Armon,
&gt; 
&gt; We've recently patched an issue that affects handoffs here 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/pull/153
&gt; 
&gt; If the issue repeats for you, as well as the logs it would be very useful if 
&gt; you could follow the instructions from the pull request above ro the 
&gt; 'riak\_core\_handoff\_manager:status().' command against all nodes.
&gt; 
&gt; The pull request works around an issue where it looks like the kernel has 
&gt; closed a socket (no evidence of it any longer with netstat/ss) but the erlang 
&gt; process is still stuck in an receive call from it (gen\_tcp:recv/2 to be more 
&gt; precise).
&gt; 
&gt; Please let us know if you hit it again.
&gt; 
&gt; Best, Jon.

&gt; I wanted to ping the mailing list and see if anybody else has encountered
&gt; stalls in the partition handoffs on Riak 1.1. We added a new node to our 
&gt; cluster
&gt; last Friday, but noticed that the partition handoffs appear to have stopped 
&gt; after about 7-8 hours. 
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the handoffs completed, and the only handoffs that remained were from 
&gt; node 3 to node 2.
&gt; The ring claimant (node 1), indicated that node 3 was unreachable (via 
&gt; ring\_status).
&gt; However, Riak control did not indicate that node 3 was unreachable, and in 
&gt; fact it was
&gt; actually live and continuing to serve request.
&gt; 
&gt; To resolve this, I tried to just restart node 3. I ran "riak stop" multiple 
&gt; times, but this did
&gt; not actually seem to do anything (The node was continuing to run and serve 
&gt; requests).
&gt; Next, I attached to the node and ran "init:stop()." This started to shut down 
&gt; various
&gt; sub-systems, but the node was still running. Sending a SIGTERM signal to the 
&gt; beam vm
&gt; finally killed it. Restarting the node with "riak start" worked as expected,
&gt; and the node promptly resumed the handoffs, and finished in a few hours.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure exactly what the issue was, but something seemed to cause a
&gt; stalling of the handoffs.
&gt; 
&gt; I've attached the contents of our console.log, erlang.log, error.log and 
&gt; crash.log
&gt; from the relevant times if that is useful.
