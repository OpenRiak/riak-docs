&gt; Hello!

&gt; I've faced a problem recently. There are strange processes like
&gt; ...start\_clean which use 100% of CPU. My riak version is 0.14.2.
&gt; Do you know what is it and what can be done with it?
&gt;

Can you provide more information? When do you see this happen, and how
are you determing the process is called start\_clean?

Start\_clean is a boot script used in releases, it should only be
important when a node is booting.
