Alex-
 Turns out that there was an indexing issue with Packagecloud, which should be 
resolved now. Good news, no need to respin packages :)

 Thanks,

&gt; We’ve managed to reproduce that issue and are researching it now. It does 
&gt; appear to be something in the package itself; not sure how that didn’t turn 
&gt; up until now.
&gt; 
&gt; We’ll keep you updated. Thanks!

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Hi there,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I want to report again a problem I have with packagecloud.io; everytime I
&gt;&gt; do "aptitude update" I get a hit as if a new version of Riak is available
&gt;&gt; (that is not)... and I have to re-install Riak to a version I already have.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I just did an "aptitude safe-upgrade" and upgraded Riak to version 2.0.5
&gt;&gt; (latest):
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; # aptitude safe-upgrade
&gt;&gt; The following packages will be upgraded:
&gt;&gt; ... ... ... riak ... ... ... ... ... ...
&gt;&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt; Unpacking riak (2.0.5-1) over (2.0.1) ...
&gt;&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; # riak version
&gt;&gt; 2.0.5
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; # aptitude update
&gt;&gt; Hit https://packagecloud.io trusty InRelease
&gt;&gt; Hit https://packagecloud.io trusty/main Sources
&gt;&gt; Hit https://packagecloud.io trusty/main amd64 Packages
&gt;&gt; Hit https://packagecloud.io trusty/main i386 Packages
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; # aptitude safe-upgrade
&gt;&gt; The following packages will be upgraded:
&gt;&gt; riak
&gt;&gt; 1 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
&gt;&gt; Need to get 0 B/55.4 MB of archives. After unpacking 0 B will be used.
&gt;&gt; Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?]
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; if i select Y i get the following:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Unpacking riak (2.0.5-1) over (2.0.5-1) ...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; and everytime I check for updates, "riak" comes as requiring an update
&gt;&gt; although is not true. How to fix that? makes no sense it continues coming
&gt;&gt; as needing to be upgraded when is the same exact version.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Alex
