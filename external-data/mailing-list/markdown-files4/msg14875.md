I have released all the relevant repositories under Apache 2.0 license, the
most interesting one at the moment will be 

https://github.com/joukou/joukou-docker-riak

This is focused entirely on building a production ready Docker image for
CoreOS that utilizes etcd, confd, fleet and rudder. Hence why this is a
different project to Hector's existing work as that is not dependant on the
CoreOS stack. This project would not be suitable for users who are not
building on top of CoreOS.

Discussion on GitHub issues and/or IRC welcome. As are pull requests.

Thanks to Hector for providing the starting point for this project!

Look forward to some fruitful collaboration!
