&gt; Just an informal poll- what is preferred for Linux vm.swappiness
&gt; setting for Riak in a \*cloud\* environment? The default is 60 - a lot

&gt; 
&gt; I am thinking vm.swappiness = 0
&gt; 
&gt; - Avoid slow & potentially costly I/O operations in the virtualized 
&gt; environment
&gt; - Make it easier to see if bitcask is running low of memory, as soon
&gt; as the Swap partition has been touched at all (1st out of memory
&gt; condition)
&gt; - Disk cache wont be as effective.
&gt; - I just like seeing Swap: 0% when I log in :0
&gt; 
&gt; Does this setting even matter at all, practically speaking?
