- Should I create a connection pool or it's OK to create {ok, Pid} =
riakc\_pb\_socket:start\_link("127.0.0.1", 8087) on each web request in my
erlang app

It's very strange and pity that erlang native client doesn't support all
features Java one has:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/Client-Libraries/

- Am I right that Link walking is implemented as Map/Reduce and it uses
full scan?

- How do you connect to riak nodes (I mean how to decide to which node
connet) or just put Riak cluster behind HAProxy and that's all

Thanks
