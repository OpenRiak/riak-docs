Both LevelDB and Bitcask are optimized for smaller objects, so neither will be 
particularly good at it.

Again: this is possible but discouraged.

&gt; 
&gt; You certainly can with some careful tuning.
&gt; 
&gt; However, if Riak is being used for heavy traffic loads, youâ€™ll likely see 
&gt; poor performance as a consequence. Those large objects effectively clog the 
&gt; pipes temporarily.
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully someone can chime in with tuning recommendations, but make certain 
&gt; allow\_mult is set to false; if those images end up with siblings, things can 
&gt; get very ugly.
&gt; 
&gt; We generally recommend Riak CS to manage the chunking of data into Riak to 
&gt; store large objects.

&gt; Dear, 
&gt; 
&gt; Can I directly store images as big as 2~6MB into riak as an object?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you!
