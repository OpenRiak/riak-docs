In general, what's the process for upgrading a ring?

Do you take nodes out of the ring one at a time, upgrade them, and
re-add them to the ring, or do you build an entirely new ring and
restore the data from backups?

I imagine this partly depends on how many versions behind you are, and
the specific changes to the server and storage backends.

thanks,
Tim
