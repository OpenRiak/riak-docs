Yes. Confirmed.

There are options available in app.config to control how often this occurs and 
how many vnodes rehash at once: defaults are every 7 days and two vnodes per 
server at a time.

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I've been trying to find what may be the cause of this.
&gt; 
&gt; Every once in a week, all the nodes in my riak cluster start to do some kind 
&gt; of operation that lasts at least for two days. 
&gt; 
&gt; You can watch a sample of my munin logs regarding the last week in here:
&gt; 
&gt; https://cloudup.com/imWiBwaC6fm
&gt; Take a look at the days 19 and 20, and now it has started again on the 26...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm suspecting that this may be caused by the aae hash trees being 
&gt; regenerated, as you say in your documentation:
&gt; For added protection, Riak periodically (default: once a week) clears and 
&gt; regenerates all hash trees from the on-disk K/V data.
&gt; Can you confirm me that this may be the root of the "problem" and if it's 
&gt; normal for the action to last for two days?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm using riak 1.4.2 on 6 machines, with centOS. The backend is levelDB.
&gt;
