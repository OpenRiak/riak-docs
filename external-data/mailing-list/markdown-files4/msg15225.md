Don't use that. It's internal to Riak. Never never use /internal\_solr. Use the 
/solr interface exposed by Riak, and defined in the documentation.
Take care,
Eric

Hi Eric,

I'm using the internal\_solr web front end right now, port 8093
On this particular example, I have just one Riak node running locally - version 
2.0.1 - I haven't tested this on a multi node Riak install yet.

Your response header should contain shard and many filter values. What URL are 
you using to search with? Does it begin with /solr or /solr\_internal? What 
port? How many Riak nodes are you running? And what version do you have 
installed?

Thanks,
Eric

Hi Eric,

I don't get multiple siblings on a Riak GET for the key.

My buckets currently have allow\_mult: false and last\_write\_wins: true
The n\_val is the default 3

When I search, an example return is as follows, I can see the \_yz\_id has a 
unique number on the end alright though?

Thanks for the help!

Jason

You can check if your object has siblings by performing a key get, and see if 
two values return. If not, then it may be the index. Can you paste the response 
where you get two values?

&gt; Thanks Eric - I don't see the \_yz\_vtag returned in the search result set - so 
&gt; not sure how to tell that?

&gt;&gt; Hi all,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have some quick (hopefully!) questions around Riak search.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1. I'm getting multiple documents returned in the search results for a query 
&gt;&gt; - which I assume is based on the n\_val of my bucket as I tried to change the 
&gt;&gt; search index to have a n\_val of 1 but got an error that it needed to match 
&gt;&gt; the bucket n\_val - is this expected behaviour, i.e. will the search return 
&gt;&gt; multiples based from the n\_val, and I need to code for that?
&gt; 
&gt; You should only get multiple results if your values have siblings. You can 
&gt; tell if they're siblings because the duplicates will have different \_yz\_vtags.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2. What is best practice if we required to change an index (e.g. adding a 
&gt;&gt; new indexed field) and wanted to re-generate the index for a particular 
&gt;&gt; bucket?
&gt; 
&gt; Currently, that requires you rewriting your dataset again. However, there is 
&gt; a PR in the works to allow incremental schema changes, as well as allowing 
&gt; AAE to automatically update indexed documented based on schema changes: 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/pull/427
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
