Unfortunately not, the log files are suspiciously quiet .. but I'm
reasonably certain that I'm looking in the right place.

However, I think I fixed the problem.

After doing a \*make rel\* I went in and modified the etc config to have riak
use an external ip address and I think its that that caused the problem.

Instead I needed to make the change to \*rel/vars.config\* and then redo
the \*make
rel\* leading me to suspect that the values are actually compiled in
somewhere and not just read from a config file on startup.

&gt; Are there any error messages in your Riak Search log files?

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was running an older version of riak (v12) for a while and recently
&gt;&gt; upgraded to riak\_search (v14).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I can connect to the node, I can ping it. But any put or get results in a
&gt;&gt; timeout.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There is a difference in deployment, previously I was running it on the
&gt;&gt; same host as the client and accessing directly using the erlang client api
&gt;&gt; (not pb).
&gt;&gt; Now, I moved the node on a separate machine and can connect to it both
&gt;&gt; from the original host and also locally on the same host.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Following the instructions in README.txt to test, results in a pong from
&gt;&gt; the ping but timeouts (after a long delay).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm a bit stumped. Any tips ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; JT.
