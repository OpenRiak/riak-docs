Hmmmm. Not that I know of and I hadn't heard of JugglingDB previously. What
do you find interesting about it, Shailesh?

&gt; Hello All!
&gt;
&gt; Here’s the latest summary of the Riak users mailing list, latest client
&gt; releases and job openings at Basho.
&gt;
&gt; ## Latest Releases
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - NodeJS Client 2.1.2 - includes improvements to closed connections
&gt; handling such as with AWS ELB. Release notes [1] and code [2].
&gt; - Java Client 2.0.5 - brings a number of fixes including a fix to a
&gt; DNS refresh issue and enhanced testing. Release notes [3] and maven repo
&gt; [4].
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ## Recently Answered
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - Magnus and Russell help Oleksiy clear up some confusion about the
&gt; hidden $bucket index [5] - but only when using leveldb. Nevertheless,
&gt; perhaps a $bucket query should not be accepted against a bitcask backend
&gt; [6].
&gt; - Robert notes that when joining nodes to clusters they must have the
&gt; same ring sizes [7].
&gt; - Agung is interested in working with riak\_ensemble [8][9] and has a
&gt; few questions about it. Carlos recommends taking a look at nkbase [10],
&gt; which uses riak\_ensemble, and Sargun goes into more detail [11].
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ## Open Discussions
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - Fred and Magnus are working with Oleksiy to determine the root cause
&gt; of inconsistent Solr search results [12].
&gt; - Bartek is looking for assistance on how to feed a mapreduce job with
&gt; the results of a full text search [13]
&gt; - Kinson is looking for guidance on implementing Basho Bench [14]
&gt; - There is an open question regarding whether it’s possible to
&gt; rebalance Riak KV without adding/removing nodes or making any hardware
&gt; changes [15]
&gt; - Luke thinks that Gerhard’s proposed architecture will ensure
&gt; replicas are distributed to every node, but invites someone with more
&gt; knowledge of the hashing method to chime in [16]
&gt; - Robert is looking for guidance on choosing EC2 instance types for
&gt; use with Riak/LevelDB [17]
&gt; - Vitaly is helping troubleshoot timeouts in a deployment of Riak KV
&gt; running on a cluster with 512 partitions [18]
&gt; - There’s an open question about debugging a post commit hook for a
&gt; bucket type in Riak 2.1.3 [19]
&gt; - Christopher explained that when configuring multiple Riak clients in
&gt; a cluster, you need to have each client use a different name. Chathuri has
&gt; some follow-up questions about the configuration [20]
&gt; - Vitaly and Chris are helping troubleshoot testing in a single node
&gt; implementation of Riak KV [21]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ## Jobs at Basho
&gt;
&gt; Interested in working on distributed computing related problems? Perhaps
&gt; these open positions at Basho may be of interest:
&gt;
&gt; - Developer Advocate (London and US) [22]
&gt; - Client Services Engineer (USA) [23]
&gt; - Consulting Engineer (USA) [24]
&gt;
