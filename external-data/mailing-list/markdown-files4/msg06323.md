&gt; Is there anyway to delete old record ??

This question could mean either of two things.

You can of course issue a delete request against any records you like, using 
any of Riak's APIs.

If you would instead like records to automatically be deleted when they are 
old, and you are using the Bitcask storage engine, you can configure it for 
expiry:

So, no matter which of the two questions you were asking -- the answer is "yes."
