&gt; Is there - or could there be - an efficient way to grow/expire indexes

Les,

Currently Riak's backends don't really have any way to initiate
communication with the vnode. E.g. bitcask has key expiry but no way to
fire an event back up the chain to the vnode to let it know "this key is
expired and you should clear it's indexes."

Another potential way to do it is put the notion of expiry in both the
object and index backends. In that case you'll have to deal with the fact
that there is a race condition between the two. Which may not matter
depending on your applications needs.
