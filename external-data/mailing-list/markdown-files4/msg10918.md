&gt; Has anyone tried to use Riak with Disco? [ http://discoproject.org ] I was 
&gt; looking for Hadoop alternatives ( as the RIAK-HADOOP connector project seems 
&gt; not going anywhere ) and I think Disco is quite interesting, moreover is 
&gt; written in Erlang same as Riak. Looks like it would be a good match!
&gt; 
Looks interesting, though it's It's written in Python from what I can see, not 
Erlang ;) Still makes a refreshing change yet-another-java-thing though.
