To coincide with the Riak 1.0.0 release candidate, we have also released
Innostore 1.0.3 binaries that work with the backend changes made in Riak
1.0.0.

For this release, there are tar files containing the binaries for each of
Riak's supported platforms. The tar files can be unpacked into the
/usr/lib/riak directory as they were in previous releases.

Thanks,
