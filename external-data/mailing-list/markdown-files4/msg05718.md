This is the answer I hoped not to read. You might call it a premature
optimization but I believe it is reasonable to try to create a
distributed Erlang app with Riak as a dependency.

I've been hacking on a Riak fork that twiddles the rebar and reltool
configs to shoehorn my own code into the same VM. That part is awkward
but not impossible.

I was hoping you'd say Basho was working on an easy way to include
Riak as a rebar dep without forking as I did.

&gt; This is the preferred way to attack this problem. Separation of the
&gt; functionality by O/S processes is appropriate and much easier to
&gt; reason about in error situations. Loopback sockets to the PBs
&gt; interface should be within a 1 ms of total request handling time.
