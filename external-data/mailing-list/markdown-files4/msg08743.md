Hi,

we are currently evaluating using riak as storage backend for our users 
messages (currently running on MySQL).


This will result to about 4.2 billion k/v with an estimated key-length 
of about 25-30 bytes and about average 400 bytes of data (the messages 
are usually very short). The amount of data will raise about 8 million 
k/v per day. Most data will only be read a few times and never again 
afterwards.


I entered this into the bitcask calculator, which resulted in a quite 
high number of suggested nodes just because of the memory requirement 
for storing all the keys. Is this really necessary if only very little 
of this data is really "active"?


Or should I use Level-DB instead? How do I estimate the amount of nodes 
with Level-DB?
