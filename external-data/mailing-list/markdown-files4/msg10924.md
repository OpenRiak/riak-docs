is written in Erlang but the MR jobs are written in JavaScript ( also
can be written in Erlang though )

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Has anyone tried to use
Riak with Disco? [ http://discoproject.org [1] ] I was looking for
Hadoop alternatives ( as the RIAK-HADOOP connector project seems not
going anywhere ) and I think Disco is quite interesting, moreover is
written in Erlang same as Riak. Looks like it would be a good match!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
Looks interesting, though it's It's written in Python from what I can
see, not Erlang ;) Still makes a refreshing change
yet-another-java-thing though.
