Jon,

I haven't heard of anyone working on it. I don't know if you build
homebrew packages from source or from our binary packages, but if so I
goofed up in one of my release scripts and the 64bit osx packages didn't
get uploaded. They are uploaded now and the site will get a refresh pretty
soon. If you do use binaries, sorry to make you wait.

-Jared

&gt; Awesome news!
&gt;
&gt; Is someone already working on a Homebrew Formula for it? (don't want to
&gt; duplicate efforts if they are...)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!

&gt; &gt; Hi All -
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Grab a coffee and hang onto your buffers. There is a lot of awesome
&gt; &gt; stuff to cover here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ## Riak CS Now Open Source
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is with great pride, pleasure, and excitement that we announce Riak
&gt; &gt; CS (Cloud Storage) is now open source under the Apache 2 license!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For those of you not familiar with Riak CS, here's the tl;dr (from our
&gt; docs):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Riak CS is multi-tenant cloud storage software for public and private
&gt; &gt; clouds. Built on Basho's distributed database Riak, Riak CS is
&gt; &gt; designed to provide simple, available, distributed cloud storage at
&gt; &gt; any scale. Riak CS is S3-API compatible and supports per-tenant
&gt; &gt; reporting for billing and metering use cases.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you want to take it for a test drive:

&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; contribute to it:

&gt; &gt; \* RICON EAST this May in New York City will have various Riak CS
&gt; &gt; content and talks. Join us: ricon.io/east.html
&gt; &gt; \* The HackerNews thread is sure to be quite lively, too :)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Wired [1], TechCrunch [2], and GigaOm [3] also did pieces on the release.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ## Riak CS 1.3 Is Now official
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In addition to the code being open source, we're also releasing the
&gt; &gt; 1.3 version of Riak CS.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This release is full of great features and numerous bug fixes. The
&gt; &gt; full Riak CS 1.3 release notes are here:
&gt; &gt; http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/Riak-CS-Release-Notes/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ## Community Support - Mailing List and IRC
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We're planning to use the existing Riak users mailing list for Riak CS
&gt; &gt; users. Most of the issues and deployment questions about CS will have
&gt; &gt; some sort of Riak component to them, so it doesn't make sense to split
&gt; &gt; the discussions and support channels in two at the moment. That said,
&gt; &gt; if the CS-specific traffic proves to heavy, we'll revisit the idea of
&gt; &gt; spinning up a new list for CS.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Additionally, the #riak room on freenode will serve as the IRC support
&gt; channel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ## What Now?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you've never been excited about S3-Compatible cloud storage, the
&gt; &gt; time is now. :) All of us here at Basho are thrilled about expanding
&gt; &gt; the Riak Community with those of you who need flexible, scalable, open
&gt; &gt; source cloud storage. We're looking forward to you using and
&gt; &gt; contributing to Riak CS.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let us know if you have any questions. And thanks for being a great
&gt; community.
&gt; &gt;
