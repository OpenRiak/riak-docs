It is not in 1.3. We actually had the code freeze for 1.3.0 a \_long\_ time ago 
(I think it was 16th Nov 2012) and this fix did not make it in time for the 
freeze.

Sorry,

&gt; I think I'm hitting the same issue here. In one project I'm using last write 
&gt; wins and the read repair count is ridiculously high. I'm hoping that this 
&gt; might also help reducing the latency problem we are seeing for the 99th+ 
&gt; percentiles of requests.

&gt;&gt; It is fixed in master, but it doesn't look like it made it into 1.3.0. If 
&gt;&gt; you're ok with building from source, I tried it and a patch from 
&gt;&gt; 8895d2877576af2441bee755028df1a6cf2174c7 goes cleanly onto 1.3.0.
