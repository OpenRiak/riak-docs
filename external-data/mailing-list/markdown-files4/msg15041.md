Thanks everyone for your replies.

I have used nsenter for interactive debugging from the host, but I havn't
tried to use it for intra-container shell access. I will look into it albeit
not an ideal solution.

Just to explore possibilities further, how does riak-admin actually
communicate with the Riak daemon process ? 

Is it possible that I could install riak-admin in both containers, and share
a file or network resource between the containers that riak-admin could use
to connect to the Riak daemon from the application container ? What is it
exactly that riak-admin needs to connect to Riak ? 

Thanks,

Isaac
