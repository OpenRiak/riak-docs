Since you're approaching this from the academic perspective, it might
be useful to start with a formal presentation of a problem [1] and
then look around GitHub in the "Issues" section of the Riak
repositories.

&gt; Dear Riak community,
&gt;
&gt; I am a PhD student who is trying to build a system to find latent scalability 
&gt; problems that cannot be found in small-scale cluster.
&gt; (So offline test cannot find them, but users experience them when they deploy 
&gt; on large scale like 100/1000 machines)
&gt;
&gt; I would love to see past interesting bugs so I started to dig in to bug 
&gt; report of Riak and mailing list.
&gt; However, it would be good if someone can point me to past interesting bugs 
&gt; related to scalability.
&gt; So is there anyone experienced scalability bugs in the past?
&gt; If possible can you tell me what problems you faced.
&gt;
&gt; I appreciate your help.
&gt; Thank you.
&gt;
&gt; Best,
&gt; Tanakorn L.
