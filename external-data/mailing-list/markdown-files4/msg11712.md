I'm not sure, I would suggest you to go through release notes, the link 
I sent you is for the latest version which is 1.4, depending on the 
version of Riak you want to use or required to use different 
settings/tuning apply, go chronologically from 1st relevant version to 
last and see what applies to you and what have changed:


\*Riak 1.2.1\*: https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.2/RELEASE-NOTES.md
\*Riak 1.3.2:\* https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.3/RELEASE-NOTES.md
\*Riak 1.4:\* https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.4/RELEASE-NOTES.md

The same applies for tuning doc, it is different per version, I guess 
you already figured out how to locate each.


HTH,

Guido.

Thanks Guido. While great advice, those tuning tips seems to cover a limited
amount of optimization mainly OS based. If also found the configuration
files doc's
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.2.0/references/Configuration-Files/) but I am
uncertain of which parameters should I be modifying and to which values.

One last question, given the size of data I am pushing into Riak (&lt; 1kb per
record) it appears to be it would be a good idea to disable Nable's
Algorithm;
 1) Are my thoughts correct?
 2) I cant seem to find the [disable\_pb\_nagle] flag anywhere in the config
file, is that expected because I am supposed to add it?

Thanks again.
