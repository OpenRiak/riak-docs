Which Riak backend are you using: bitcask, leveldb, multi?

&gt; Hi all!
&gt; 
&gt; I have a fairly trivial question regarding mass deletion on a riak cluster, 
&gt; but firstly let me give you just some context. My cluster is running with 
&gt; riak 1.4.6 on 6 machines with a ring of 256 nodes and 1Tb ssd disks.
&gt; 
&gt; I need to execute a massive object deletion on a bucket, I'm talking of ~1 
&gt; billion keys (The object average size is ~1Kb). I will not retrive the keys 
&gt; from riak because a I have a file with all of them. I'll just start a script 
&gt; that reads them from the file and triggers an HTTP DELETE for each one.
&gt; The cluster will continue running on production with a quite high load 
&gt; serving all other applications, while running this deletion.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is simple, do I need to have any kind of extra concerns regarding 
&gt; this action? Do you advise me on taking special attention to any kind of 
&gt; metrics regarding riak or event the servers where it's running?
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards!
