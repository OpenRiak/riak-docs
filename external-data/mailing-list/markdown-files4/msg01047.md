Yeah, well it looks like that. I haven't had any problems with associating an 
address to a client
through rails console for example but then I would do:

client = Client.new(:name =&gt; 'someclient')
client.address = Address.new(:address =&gt; 'abcde' )
client.save

The problem is in the form building, and I don't know if there perhaps isn't 
support for that or if
it's a bug or if I'm doing something wrong.

&gt; John,
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like you're assigning the key of the Address to the association on 
&gt; the Client. If these are in a one-to-one relationship, it would make more 
&gt; sense to me to store the Address inside the Client object. On the other 
&gt; hand, if you prefer them to be linked, load the Address in your controller 
&gt; before assigning it to the association.
&gt; 
&gt; I've also added an issue for \*\_keys accessor methods that should ease the 
&gt; linking up of independent objects. These would be similar to the \*\_ids 
&gt; methods that ActiveRecord provides.
