&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to use Riak's gem 'ripple' for a Ruby on Rails project and I was 
&gt; wondering if there was any 'advanced' documentation for data manipulation in 
&gt; the Document Model. Specifically, setting up and using secondary indexes, 
&gt; accessing 'self' variables, etc.

I've been working on new documentation that's more prose-like: 
http://ripple-docs.herokuapp.com/

Right now it's in a Rails app awkwardly jammed in to a side-branch in my fork: 
https://github.com/bkerley/ripple/tree/page-generator

If you'd like anything more specific, please let me know!
