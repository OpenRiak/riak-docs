Hi Jeremy,

That is strange. Can you try running "bin/riak-admin ringready",
"bin/riak-admin transfers", "bin/riak-admin member\_status", and
"bin/riak-admin ring\_status"? Does everything look normal?

Also, if possible, a zip file of your ./data directory would help us
immensely while troubleshooting. (Feel free to email the link to me off
list.)

Best,
Rusty

&gt; I've seen this on my dev machine (haven't noticed it in production, but it
&gt; could be happening). The production cluster is running Riak 1.0.2 and my
&gt; dev machine is running 1.0 (96d0b8011 from Oct 6) compiled from source. The
&gt; data on my dev machine is an import of the data from production (via
&gt; riak-admin backup/restore).
&gt;
&gt; Anyone seen this issue? Help on debugging the cause appreciated.
