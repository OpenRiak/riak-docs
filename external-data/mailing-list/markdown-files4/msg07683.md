Getting dynos to communicate might be tricky. When you make an HTTP
request to heroku, the request first hits the heroku "routing mesh". The
mesh is responsible for deciding which dyno will service the request. I
don't know of any way to explicitly send a request to a specific dyno.

Dynos are also expected to use no more than 512MB of memory.

This article gives more information on how dynos operate and their
restrictions.

Despite all of this, it might be fun to try anyway just to see the results!
Let us know how it goes.

&gt; The thing that makes me curious is whether the things riak\_core (not
&gt; riak\_kv) depends on (handoff particularly) could be shoehorned into this
&gt; environment using the stock tools. I suspect not but wanted to scratch an
&gt; intellectual itch. :)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!

&gt; Hi Jeff,
&gt;
&gt; Dynos on Heroku don't have access to any permanent disk storage. They can
&gt; read and write to /tmp, but that is not guaranteed to stick around.
&gt;
&gt; Dynos are also restricted to only accept HTTP connections. This would
&gt; rule out any ProtocolBuffer connections.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Curious if anyone is able to use clustered nodes on Heroku using the
&gt;&gt; Erlang buildpack [1]? Seems like it should at least be theoretically
&gt;&gt; possible to launch new dynos that become part of your node cluster. How
&gt;&gt; reliable/easy/hard is node communication on EC2?
