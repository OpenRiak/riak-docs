So long as the dynos can communicate with one another and cooperate via node 
communication, the stateless nature of the application doesn't really matter. I 
don't need to persist anything once a dyno is shut down. 

The thing that makes me curious is whether the things riak\_core (not riak\_kv) 
depends on (handoff particularly) could be shoehorned into this environment 
using the stock tools. I suspect not but wanted to scratch an intellectual 
itch. :)

Thanks!

&gt; Hi Jeff,
&gt; 
&gt; Dynos on Heroku don't have access to any permanent disk storage. They can 
&gt; read and write to /tmp, but that is not guaranteed to stick around.
&gt; 
&gt; Dynos are also restricted to only accept HTTP connections. This would rule 
&gt; out any ProtocolBuffer connections.
&gt; 
&gt; Curious if anyone is able to use clustered nodes on Heroku using the Erlang 
&gt; buildpack [1]? Seems like it should at least be theoretically possible to 
&gt; launch new dynos that become part of your node cluster. How 
&gt; reliable/easy/hard is node communication on EC2?
