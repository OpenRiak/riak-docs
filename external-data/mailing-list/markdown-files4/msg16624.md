On second thought, ignore the Search recommendation. Search + Expiry
doesn't work very well (when objects expire from Riak, their search index
entries persist, except now those are orphaned).

&gt; Hi David,
&gt;
&gt; 1) Storing billions of small files is definitely a good use case for Riak
&gt; KV. (Since they're small, there's no reason to use CS (now re-branded as
&gt; S2)).
&gt;
&gt; 2) As far as deleting an entire bucket, that part is tougher.
&gt;
&gt; (Incidentally, if you were thinking of using Riak CS because it has a
&gt; 'delete bucket' command (see
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/references/apis/storage/s3/RiakCS-DELETE-Bucket/
&gt; ) -- that won't work, the delete bucket command requires all objects to be
&gt; deleted first. Meaning, you can only perform it on an empty bucket. Which
&gt; doesn't help you :) ).
&gt;
&gt; Your best bet is to use the Bitcask back end (instead of leveldb), and use
&gt; its Automatic Expiration setting (see the end of the
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/bitcask/#Configuring-Bitcask
&gt; section, under 'Automatic Expiration').
&gt;
&gt; So, you can say:
&gt;
&gt; bitcask.expiry = 30d
&gt;
&gt; And all of the objects (in all buckets using that backend) will be expired
&gt; 30 days (from their last-modified timestamp). Which also effectively
&gt; deletes the bucket they were in.
&gt;
&gt; Now, this setting is per-backend. So, if you need other buckets without
&gt; expirations, you'd want to set up a Multi backend. So, the default backend
&gt; could be a plain non-expiry Bitcask (or leveldb), and then a second backend
&gt; would have the expiry setting. You can learn more here:
&gt;
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/multi/
&gt;
&gt; What if you want to delete buckets but also use LevelDB?
&gt;
&gt; That depends on why you want LevelDB. If you're using it for Secondary
&gt; Index capability -- you can use Search instead, that works with Bitcask.
&gt; Or, on the flip side, you can use 2i (secondary index) queries to delete
&gt; the bucket. You'd use a 2i query to get all the keys in an expiring bucket,
&gt; and then issue Deletes to each key. (Don't forget to delete with a W value
&gt; equal to your N value. Or you may have to run the query + delete a few
&gt; times, to account for stray missing replicas).
&gt;
&gt; Does that help explain the situation?

&gt;&gt; Hi List,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; would you say that storing billions of very small (json) files is a good
&gt;&gt; usecase for riak kv or cs?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; here's what I would do:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; \* create daily buckets ( i.e. 2015-10-07)
&gt;&gt; \* up to 130 Million inserts per day
&gt;&gt; \* about 150.000 read-ony accesses/day
&gt;&gt; \* no updates on existing keys/files
&gt;&gt; \* delete buckets (including keys/files) older than x days
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I already have a working riak-kv/leveldb cluster (inserts and lookups are
&gt;&gt; going smoothly), but when it comes to mass deletion of keys I found no way
&gt;&gt; to do this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; David
