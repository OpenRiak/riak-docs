If you use the adt-bsd-support branch for erlang\_js, skerl and eleveldb,
riak will build with no issues.

To run it however, you need to edit the shebang paths for the scripts
in rel/files to not point to /bin/bash before generating a release (or
install bash). The scripts don't have any bashisms in them though, they
work just fine under /bin/sh.
