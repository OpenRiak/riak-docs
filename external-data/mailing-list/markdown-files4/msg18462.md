Hi,
Interesting to hear about forks out there running in production.

WRT the meet-up, things we’d be happy to talk about/like to discuss if there’s 
time on the agenda. We’d be able to give talks/lead discussions on these topics:

- Repl, Rabl, AAE, and Fullsync
- Leveled
- New indexing and querying and the future CRDT work
- A review of the estate from the NHS POV (tech debt, OTP20, Build and release 
etc)

Cheers

Russell

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Thanks for taking over riak management.
&gt; I am strongly commited to the success of this take over as we intensively use 
&gt; riak for our customers solutions.
&gt; Arnaud Wetzel, founder and CTO of KBRW, the company I'm actually working for, 
&gt; has been contributing to riak but, due the lack of visibility on the roadmap, 
&gt; we have also been maintaining our own build of riak.
&gt; Precisely, we use 3 flavours of riak:
&gt; \* our own build, based on riak 1.1, with additional patches: for instance, 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/merge\_index/pull/32
&gt; \* a vanilla riak 2.2
&gt; \* riak TS 1.3.0
&gt; 
&gt; As many of us, I suppose, we are really interested in sharing the efforts on 
&gt; riak and want to contribute to it.
&gt; 
&gt; In a few words, by the past, we (ie Arnaud Wetzel :) ), has contributed to 
&gt; the following features that are now integrated upstream:
&gt; \* IPV6 support (mainly through BEAM)
&gt; \* Cassandra search algorithm integration into riak\_search (pending pull 
&gt; request)
&gt; \* geoloc search, now merged into SOLR
&gt; \* Symfony bundle for riak (yeah, some use it :) )
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the license, we also agree on Apache 2, and would like to avoid GPL.
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the governance, we support the following points:
&gt; \* limit community disruption
&gt; \* looking out how to mitigate the roadmap uncertainty and lack of 
&gt; transparency of the recent period.
&gt; We are convinced that a better balance between community and business should 
&gt; help to avoid this issue.
&gt; 
&gt; I need now to introduce myself with my other hat of OW2 consortium chairman. 
&gt; This organization aims at supporting open source projects providing:
&gt; \* supporting infrastructure: gitlab, continuous integration, mailing lists, 
&gt; etc (in case project need them)
&gt; \* maturity assesment tools
&gt; \* best practices and governance guidelines to help reaching it
&gt; \* logistic support with a strong presence into international conferences, 
&gt; dedicated booths for our corporate members, etc
&gt; 
&gt; I would be glad to join the meeting at Bet365 facilities to discussing these 
&gt; points.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Jean

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We are beginning to plan out the two day workshop [1]. We are thinking the 
&gt;&gt; first day will start with an introduction from Martin Davies, in which 
&gt;&gt; Martin will detail current status and the asset list.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; After which we will get into project questions, such as:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Which license?
&gt;&gt; The general consensus is Apache2. We need to complete the discussion as 
&gt;&gt; HyperLogLog has been introduced which is GPL’d. Our thoughts are to replace 
&gt;&gt; HLL.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Baseline?
&gt;&gt; We have heard some discussion around where to baseline the codebase. The 
&gt;&gt; concern is during the demise of Basho the correct level of diligence was not 
&gt;&gt; applied to promotes meaning the code such as HLL has crept in.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Governance?
&gt;&gt; How are we to manage the project going forward? Our feeling is we do not 
&gt;&gt; need a formal body as being discussed in the slack group. We see the project 
&gt;&gt; going forward as a simple repo into which likeminded developers agree and 
&gt;&gt; contribute changes. Placing overbearing procedure and structure on what is 
&gt;&gt; currently a small community will dissuade other from joining and 
&gt;&gt; contributing.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Supporting infrastructure.
&gt;&gt; The Basho websites, github account, and mailing group are all included in 
&gt;&gt; the deal. We are currently supporting the mailing list, and once the deal is 
&gt;&gt; complete we will continue to support the Basho domains; restricting 
&gt;&gt; community disruption.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Roadmap
&gt;&gt; Below, in no particular order, are the items we wish to address internally. 
&gt;&gt; If we can all share our lists we can come to an agreed community roadmap 
&gt;&gt; between us.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; · Review / rationalisation of Basho JIRA tickets / git issues
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; · Replication
&gt;&gt; o Address known issues (30+) to add stability
&gt;&gt; o Selective replication
&gt;&gt; o Persistent realtime queue
&gt;&gt; o Review of general approach
&gt;&gt; § In / out of band
&gt;&gt; § Snapshot vs deltas
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; · General
&gt;&gt; o Address known issues (20+) to add stability
&gt;&gt; o Silent data loss bug in riak\_kv
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; · Enhancements
&gt;&gt; o G Sets
&gt;&gt; o Big Sets
&gt;&gt; o CRDT Maps
&gt;&gt; o Async read / write vnodes
&gt;&gt; o Split backend vnodes
&gt;&gt; o Head requests – don’t return body to co-ordinator
&gt;&gt; o Rudimentary indexing (leverage TS work)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; · Consolidation / feature cross population of KV,CS, and TS codebases
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; · Erlang / OTP upgrade
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; At this point we want to keep the structure of the day loose to allow the 
&gt;&gt; conversations to flow, our collective priorities to take precedence.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The sessions will be live streamed, with details to follow.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We will also man IRC / Slack for discourse.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Food and refreshments will be provided throughout the two days.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Hopefully this gives us something to discuss in the build up to the 12th 
&gt;&gt; Oct. We’re looking for everyone’s input so we can hit the ground running.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As a quick update on the status of the purchase. We have exchanged funds and 
&gt;&gt; the court process continues. One clarifying point for anyone following the 
&gt;&gt; court proceedings. The purchasing company is our technology arm, Hillside 
&gt;&gt; Technology Limited, not the bet365 group.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Andy.
