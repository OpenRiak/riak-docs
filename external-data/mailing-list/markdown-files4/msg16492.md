Hi Christopher, the Vagrantfile was moved to a separate repo:
https://github.com/basho-labs/vagrant-riak-mesos

That being said, this project is a moving target, and you can expect
changes over the next few days. I intend to upload the precompiled
artifacts this week to enable builds to happen on other platforms (such as
Mac OSX).

Thanks,
Drew

&gt; &gt; You're running into the fact that this project is an experimental
&gt; &gt; demo. Please continue down the right steps by using issues on the
&gt; &gt; repo, as you've done with #60 [0]. It may help to know the Vagrantfile
&gt; &gt; in the project spins up without issue [1].

&gt; Hi Matthew,
&gt;
&gt; The link you provided to the Vagrant file returns a 404.
