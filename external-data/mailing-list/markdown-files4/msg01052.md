Bryan,

That should only be an issue if you are putting the source of the function 
directly in your query. Instead, try saving the function in a bucket/key and 
refer to it that way. Here's what a phase using bucket/key instead of source 
would look like:

{"map":{"language":"javascript","bucket":"customMR","key":"extractSomeFields","keep":false}}

You can use curl or any one of the the language-specific clients to store the 
function, just specify "application/javascript" as the content-type.

I use this technique in the "yakriak" demo app:
