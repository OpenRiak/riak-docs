&gt; This is not a good msg to have. I'm not sure if it's causing you any harm
&gt; but Riak has two notions of the ring. A per-node ring which is internal
&gt; to
&gt; the node and a gossiped ring which all nodes share with each other. For
&gt; some reason, an internal ring has leaked into the gossip. Do you notice
&gt; any issues with your cluster? What does `riak-admin ring\_status` and
&gt; `riak-admin member\_status` show? What about `riak-admin transfers`?
&gt; 

The cluster seems to be running well. All of the riak-admin commands seem
to report a good state (as far as I can tell). 
http://pastebin.com/FcU4mYNR Here is their output... riak-admin \* 

I wonder if the cause of this is also what caused or is related to why my
merge\_index(s) were corrupt and I couldn't grow my cluster too?
