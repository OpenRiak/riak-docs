Client IDs are still used if the riak\_kv / vnode\_vclocks setting is false.
If it is true, the client ID will simply be ignored. For compatibility's
sake, it's best to send/set them still.

&gt; I guess the fundamental question is: In new clusters unaffected by pre-1.0

&gt;
&gt; I ask because I was deep into figuring out how to do this efficiently with
&gt; the Riak PBC API for PUT requests, when I realized that the documentation
&gt; for HTTP PUT no longer even mentions 
&gt; it
&gt; .
&gt;
&gt; If client-id isn't totally deprecated, I will probably start finding a way
&gt; to shoehorn it into individual PBC PUT requests, as keeping a
&gt; per-connection client id is very onwieldy. Please advise. :)
