&gt; This is has been most helpful. Thank you. Hopefully these “knobs” have been 
&gt; added to the AWS EC2 instances. Since you us linode then you don’t know

&gt; hardware.

&gt; 
&gt; Well, I would say in any circumstance where you care about performance or the 
&gt; availability of your data. Obviously the gold standard is bare metal. A 
&gt; search on google for "aws guaranteed different physical machines" yielded 
&gt; this aws forum thread from 2006, 
&gt; https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=55112. Things may have 
&gt; changed since then. But I use linode which tells you which physical hardware 
&gt; your vm is on.

&gt; How strict is this “Under no circumstances should you have more than one VM 
&gt; (one logical node in a Riak cluster) on the same physical hardware” rule? It 
&gt; doesn’t fit my situation but there has to be some leniency because Riak has 
&gt; to work in a cloud and you are not guaranteed that your provisioned VM will 
&gt; be on different physical hardware than the other nodes.

&gt; 
&gt; It can't be said enough times but the number one thing you can do to ensure 
&gt; that you are getting true performance (not to mention redundancy) is to use 
&gt; different physical hardware for each of your nodes. Under no circumstances 
&gt; should you have more than one VM (one logical node in a Riak cluster) on the 
&gt; same physical hardware. Also, use multiple 
&gt; connections/threads/parallelism/whatever on client side and be sure to hit 
&gt; all the nodes in the cluster haproxy roundrobin-esque when writing to Riak. 
&gt; Everything else is in the noise.

&gt; There each has about 20-30GB of disk space. They each are a VM so I am not 
&gt; sure how to specify the CPU. They all seem to be 64 bit Intel processors but 
&gt; I could tell you the clock speed. The network is 1Gb Ethernet.

&gt; I have a cluster of 4 machines (4 Linux VM machines each allocated about 1 Gb 
&gt; of memory – yea I know it isn’t a lot). I would like to get some pointers on 
&gt; getting the fastest query time possible given these meager resources. Thank 
&gt; you.
