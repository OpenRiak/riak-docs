&gt; I know we did a forced shutdown this week, which was probably the cause.  But 
&gt; I would have thought that riak would have taken care of its own lock file 
&gt; bookkeeping on restarting.

Bitcask does:

It's curious that the logic didn't handle the case. What platform/OS
are you on? Are you using init scripts to restart on boot?

Thanks,

D.
