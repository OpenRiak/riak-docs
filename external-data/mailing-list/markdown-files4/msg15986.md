Hi
We have a Composite pojo which we are indexing into Riak search. If I see
the structure of the object in solr web console, it shows as nested json.
Through java client when we query it returns the Map and having
difficulties in converting it into java object. Is there a way in riak-java
client to return a pojo instead of Map and we dealing with jakson mappers?

Thanks
Santi
