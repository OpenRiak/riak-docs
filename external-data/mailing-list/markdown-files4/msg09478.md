Correction:

Sorry, I meant expiry\_secs apples to a backend. All data in a given backend is 
subject to expiration--as defined in the backend configuration--by the merge 
process each time it runs.

The expiry\_secs parameter applies to a bucket. This means all data in a given 
bucket is subject to expiration--as defined in the bucket configuration--by the 
merge process each time it runs.

Subject: Does changing backend configs apply to existing data?

Hi,
We have a situation where our production riak cluster is missing config 
information. Specifically, we are running bitcask as our backend and we did not 
define an expiry\_secs value, meaning data lives forever (which we don't want).

Question: If we changed the config and define expiry\_secs, does the expiry 
condition apply to all existing data or only to new data?

Thanks in advance
