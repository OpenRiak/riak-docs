I would probably say complex/fewer MR phases but I guess it would depend on the 
compute complexity of your functions (in order to take advantage of 
parallelism/more compute cores). My reasoning is that every time you Map you 
are reading the full value from disk. More Maps = more disk i/o. Not to mention 
the erlang to js overhead if you are running js functions.

Please report your findings!

Best,

&gt; What is better for performance in Riak?
&gt; More phases with simpler logic, or less phases with more complex logic?

&gt; For instance, if I want to check 10 different fields of the result objects, 
&gt; using 10 different functions, should I combine that all down into 1-2 m/r 
&gt; phases, or run as 10 different m/r phases?
&gt; 
&gt; I would think more phases would suggest that the workload could be 
&gt; distributed across various nodes more easily, but few phases would mean that 
&gt; the values wouldn't have to be processed as many times...
