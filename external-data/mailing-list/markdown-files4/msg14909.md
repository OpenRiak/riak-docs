&gt; Yes Ryan - that aspect is pretty clear. So with 1-1 riak-solr Yokozuna

I havenâ€™t followed this thread closely, it was just your last
email that caught my eye. The only way you'll know if it scales
is if you try. The one thing I might worry about is the heap
usage. I'm not sure if Yokozuna will allow it but you might try
tweaking the the schema so that the `\_yz\_\*` fields use on-disk
DocValues. IIRC, this was a change I was thinking of making to
reduce the heap pressure (at the potential cost of extra I/O?
Honestly it's been months since I've thought hard about this
stuff.

There is one person that I know of who has pushed Yokozuna a fair
bit and that is Wes Brown. Perhaps you can track him down and
get some hard-won answers:
