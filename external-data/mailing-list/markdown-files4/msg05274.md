you have to put something in front of riak, like haproxy, that will act as a 
gateway into and out of your riak cluster. also block ports/access on your riak 
node itself via a firewall or something like that.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm relatively new to Riak and just loving it. :)
&gt; 
&gt; I have a query about Riak that, why is there no user auth mechanisms? Is it 
&gt; the part of the design or a future candidate?
&gt; Or else, how can I make a Riak based app protect files from unauthorized 
&gt; access.
&gt; I searched the mailing list history, but didn't get a good answer.
&gt; Some pointers would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
