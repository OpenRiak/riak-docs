&gt; Yes, and you might be able to make this simpler yet. Instead of building
&gt; releases, maintain your code separately (this will also let you evolve it
&gt; separately from Riak) and simply add it to the code path and start it using
&gt; switches in vm.args. Something like this:
&gt; %% Add my application's code to the path
&gt; -pz /path/to/myapp/ebin
&gt; %% Make init start my app, assuming the function myapp:start/0 exists
&gt; -s myapp

Oh my, that's clean!

&gt; This will also allow you to roll out new versions without stopping Riak;
&gt; just send some commands to the console to reload changed modules.
&gt; Hope that helps,

Thank you for making this kick-self simple for me. I will be glad to
dump my current strategy and use this.

Andy
