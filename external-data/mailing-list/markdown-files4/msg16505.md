I second what Luke said.

Definitely use Key/Value operations for this case (the users-by-email
bucket), which is a One-to-One relationship. Don't use Search or Secondary
Indexes.

&gt; Value: Riak generated ID
&gt;
&gt; There are, I am sure, race conditions and eventual consistency issues
&gt; to keep in mind, but it's good to remember that you can use key/value
&gt; operations in this manner.

&gt; &gt; Take registration for example, within 1 second, how could I find out the

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (I have been suggested to use the email address as the key. But it's a
&gt; big
