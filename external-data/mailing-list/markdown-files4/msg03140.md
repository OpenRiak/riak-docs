Hi Mark,

The kv riak\_client doesn't support search, so how are apps that use the
native erlang api supposed to use the 'query' api remotely ?

&gt; We'll work on making those available again (in some equally-usable
&gt; format). For the moment this is your best option:

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; There are still links to the riak native client edoc's on the wiki but
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; page itself is redirected back to the index.
&gt; &gt; I use the native api in my app and have done for a year or more and have
&gt; &gt; recently upgraded to 0.14 and wanted to use the edocs to aid in writing
&gt; some
&gt; &gt; new stuff.
&gt; &gt; Yes I am aware of the PB client and no I don't want to use it.
&gt; &gt; Please put the edocs back.
&gt; &gt; kt.
