Rob,

&gt;&gt;&gt; riak.solr.search('test\_riak-search', 'terms:plasma\|en', count=10)
&gt; {'max\_score': 0.353553, 'num\_found': 2, 'docs': []}
&gt;
&gt; How is this happening? Is 'num\_found' supposed to be an accurate count?
&gt;

Can you try the same query without the count param. I would imagine count
maps to 'rows' but if it is by some chance mapping to 'start' then it would
explain the behavior. A 'start' &gt; 'numFound' would produce an empty list
of docs.
