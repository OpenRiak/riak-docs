If you're limited to R16, you can check out one of the 2.0.0 beta
releases. Please also note that due to VM bugs, we don't recommend
using any R16 release lower than R16B02.

&gt; Unfortunately "openSuSE" is not available on
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/downloads/ and there seems to be no "Riak"
&gt; repo in zypper as mentioned in
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/installing/suse/
&gt;
&gt; Since I am very new to Riak and I'd like to try out some basic features, any
&gt; release would be fine to me. I read that the benefit of compiling the
&gt; sources are the "devnodes" that can be easily used and connected to a node
&gt; ring.
