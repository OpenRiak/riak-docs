Suggest implementing security outside of riak. The interface to applications 
which use riak for storage should not be riak-dependent. In addition, it would 
be wise to avoid exposing storage-level details like bucket choice in the 
security model for your applications.

For more details in why riak should not be exposed to the internet, if that was 
in fact the intention, read this:

&gt; Is there any way to add bucket level authentication in riak ?
&gt;

&gt; want to access bucket1 using authentication ( privately) and buckets2 
&gt; publicly . Is it possible ?
&gt; If yes then how to do this and if no then is there any alternative to do this 
&gt; .
