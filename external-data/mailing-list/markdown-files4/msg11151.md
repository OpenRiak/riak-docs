It has to do with the tokenizer you are using in your schema. There are a
few different ones but the one you are using won't index less than two
characters. Not sure which is which off the top of my head but it's in the
docs somewhere. Also in the riak book.

&gt; Hello,

&gt; A noob question: why does this work?
&gt; curl "http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=title:Ti\*"
&gt;
&gt; ..but not any of these?
&gt; curl "http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=title:T\*"
&gt; curl "http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=title:\*"
&gt; curl "http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=\*"
&gt;
&gt; I can't use the getAll-feature, there is too much data. Doing a
&gt; map/reduce to get the first 10 items from a bucket seems overkill.
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to do something like 'curl
&gt; "http://localhost:8098/solr/products/select?q=\*&rows=10&start=0"' but
&gt; it does not seem to work.
&gt;
&gt; Any tips?
