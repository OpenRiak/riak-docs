&gt; There’ll still be the need of a version vector, yes. Any
&gt; advice/contribution on optimisations there greatly appreciated, thanks.

maybe moving to SWC?
https://github.com/ricardobcl/ServerWideClocks

would be good in systems where you have a lot of nodes going in and out in
the topology.

For me a must have would be a clear documentation on how using riak\_dt,
what to share with the client, how/when to merge etc... It would maybe
attract more users too. Going threw the code is quite painful :)

&gt; &gt; Is the plan to keep using riak\_dt\_vclock? If so, I might contribute
&gt; &gt; some optimizations for large numbers of actor entries (1000s).

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;&gt; Riak DT[1] is in need of some love. I know that some of you on this
&gt; list (Sargun, are you here? Heinz?) have expressed opinions on the work
&gt; that needs doing. Here is my short list, I would love to hear opinions on
&gt; priority, and any additions to this list:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. merger smaller map branch
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. deltas
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. new data types (we have a range register and some and
&gt; Multi-Value-Register to add, any more?)
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4. Internal state as records or maps (but not these messy tuples)
&gt; &gt;&gt; 5. update to rebar3
&gt; &gt;&gt; 6. update to latest erlang
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I’m pretty sure there is plenty more. Would greatly appreciate your
&gt; feedback.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Many thanks
&gt; &gt;&gt;
