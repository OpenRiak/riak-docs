Not that I know of. I believe keys are independent in this regard. Basho is 
introducing sets in riak 2.0 but I don't think they will bee sorted sets like 
in redis.

&gt; Hi there,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a question about something that just came up to my mind... can we 
&gt; determine which counter is higher in a bucket? For example:
&gt; 
&gt; # Taking the FIFA World Cup as example:
&gt; 
&gt; bucket = client.bucket\_type('counter\_bucket').bucket('goals')
&gt; counter = bucket.new('Neymar')
&gt; counter.increment(4)
&gt; counter = bucket.new('Messi')
&gt; counter.increment(4)
&gt; counter = bucket.new('JamesRodriguez')
&gt; counter.increment(5)
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any way (without using MapReduce) to get the top scorer of the World 
&gt; Cup? or a descendent ordered list of the keys by its value?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alex
