The application (VB.Net) appears to only be executing a CopyFromLocal method to 
upload the file and doing nothing with ACLs. So, should the application be 
Getting the ACL for the target folder and then applying the ACL to the file 
that was uploaded?

Hi Anthony,

When you put files, are you also including any ACL information?

&gt; We are running Riak-CS on version 1.4.8.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the situation. We have a bucket that is owned by Acct1 that 
&gt; has folders in it. Acct2 has been granted all permissions to the 
&gt; bucket and all sub-folders.
&gt;
&gt; Acct2 puts a file in one of the subfolders, but Acct1 has no 
&gt; permissions at all for the file.
&gt;
&gt; Acct1 puts a file in the same folder and Acct2 automatically has all 
&gt; of the same permissions to the file as it has to the parent folder.
&gt;
&gt; Why is it working this way and how do I get it to inherit permissions 
&gt; automatically?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Anthony
