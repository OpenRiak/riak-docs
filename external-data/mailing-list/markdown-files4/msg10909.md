Thanks for your help. Your query returned the same number over and over
again just as expected.

I think I have found the reason for my problem though. The client lib
CorrugatedIron seems to wrap each document in the MapReduce result into a
array turning the result into a nested array looking like:
[[{doc1}], [{doc2}], [{doc3}]] counting 3 arrays & 3 docs
and sometimes
[[{doc1}], [{doc2}, {doc3}]] counting 2 arrays and 2 docs (according to my
client code... :)

Why the result for same query in CorrugatedIron and for a simple curl
differs I don't know but I will investigate it further.


Thanks again for your help!

Best regards,
Mattias

&gt; Hi Mattias,
&gt;
&gt; The following curl query simply counts the number of inputs, and has
&gt; worked well for me in the past. Can you please run it against the cluster a
&gt; couple of times and see if it also return varying number of results?
&gt;
&gt; curl -XPOST http://localhost:8098/mapred
&gt; -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
&gt; -d '{"inputs":{
&gt; "bucket":"som-bucket",
&gt; "index":"userid\_bin",
&gt; "key":"18481123123"
&gt; },
&gt; "query":[{"reduce":{"language":"erlang",
&gt; "module":"riak\_kv\_mapreduce",
&gt; "function":"reduce\_count\_inputs"
&gt; }}]}'
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
&gt;
&gt; Christian
&gt;
