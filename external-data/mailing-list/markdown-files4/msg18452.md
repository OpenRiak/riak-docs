Hi again everyone -

Apologies for not setting a subject in my first email.

Of course this is Bet365's decision. The purpose of this message
thread is to let people know that the RabbitMQ team is willing to
maintain cuttlefish. I also found the following more-up-to-date fork
and will be looking at the changes there -

https://github.com/Kyorai/cuttlefish

Thanks again!
Luke

&gt; It’s for bet365 to make that decision.
&gt;
&gt; For the good of the general population the following would be nice:
&gt;
&gt; a) Upgrade to rebar3
&gt; b) Upgrade Erlang version support so it compiles under Erlang 20 (if it 
&gt; doesn’t already)
&gt; c) Package uploaded to hex.pm

&gt;&gt; Hello Riak users -
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The next RabbitMQ release (3.7.0) will use cuttlefish for its
&gt;&gt; configuration. I'm writing to express interest on behalf of the
&gt;&gt; RabbitMQ team in taking over maintenance of the project. At the
&gt;&gt; moment, we forked cuttlefish to the RabbitMQ organization [0] to fix a
&gt;&gt; couple pressing issues. After that, it would be great if the
&gt;&gt; repository could be transferred to either its own, new organization or
&gt;&gt; to the RabbitMQ organization entirely. Basho transferred both
&gt;&gt; Webmachine and Lager to their own independent organizations, for
&gt;&gt; instance (github.com/webmachine, github.com/erlang-lager)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Once transferred, GitHub will take care of all the necessary
&gt;&gt; redirections from the Basho organization to cuttlefish's new home.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Luke Bakken
