Oh, didn't know about that. Thanks Ian.

&gt; Those results are to be expected, because indexes are in lexical order.
&gt; The range between "key1" and "key2" will include all keys that start with
&gt; "key1" plus "key2"; "key10", "key1a", "key12" are all in this range.
&gt;
&gt; If you wanted to find 1 and 2 but not 10, you should add leading zeros to
&gt; the numbers. For example, "key1" would instead be "key01" and "key2" would
&gt; be "key02".The range between "key01" and "key02" would not include "key10",
&gt; but keep in mind it will include "key010".

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt;
&gt; We were using recently the range queries (like in this example:
&gt; http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.riak.user/5995, but no
&gt; mapreduce). If doing exactly that example, the return values are what I've
&gt; expected:
&gt;
&gt; curl -X GET "
&gt; http://127.0.0.1:8198/buckets/range-bucket/index/\$key/key1/key2"
&gt; {"keys":["key2","key1"]}
&gt;
&gt; BUT
&gt;
&gt; when adding more objects than ten (first key is 'key0', last key is
&gt; 'key10') and running the query (exactly the same query as above), I'm
&gt; getting back:
&gt; {"keys":["key10","key2","key1"]}
&gt;
&gt; curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8198/buckets/test-bucket/keys?keys=true"
&gt;
&gt; {"keys":["key7","key0","key8","key4","key2","key10","key3","key9","key6","key1","key5"]}
&gt;
&gt; What's happening there, as it doesn't seems to return what I would expect
&gt; ? Am I missing something ? There is some wiki page where I can find more
&gt; details on these range queries ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Alin
