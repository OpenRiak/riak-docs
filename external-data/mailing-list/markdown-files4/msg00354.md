Ah, yes. So with 1 node, I had a guaranteed 3 copies of the data, and when
I added another node, some of those got reduced to 1 or 2 on that node. I
understand now, thanks.

&gt;
&gt; With an n\_val of 3, there will be 3 copies of each data item in the
&gt; cluster even when there are less than 3 hosts. With 2 nodes in that
&gt; situation, each node will have either 1 or 2 copies of each item.
&gt;
&gt; Does that help with your understanding?
