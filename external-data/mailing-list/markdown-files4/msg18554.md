I don’t see a call to `riak\_search\_vnode:repair` in those docs

Do you still run legacy riak search (i.e. not yokozuna/solr)?

Sorry, not repairing a single partition but all partitions per node:

Hi Russell,

I was repairing each node as specified in this guide

riak\_search has been removed from riak-2.2.5. Looks like some vestige survived.

Can you tell me what command you ran, it looks to me from the output below that 
you’re connected to node and typing commands in the console?

Is this some snippet that you attach and run?

Cheers

Russell

Hi all,

We started the partitions repair a couple of weeks ago, so far so good (3 nodes 
out of 7 done), then we started getting this error:


(r...@node4.domain.com
)3&gt; [riak\_search\_vnode:repair(P) || P &lt;- Partitions].
\*\* exception error: undefined function riak\_search\_vnode:repair/1


The first two steps for the node repair executed fine:


{ok, Ring} = riak\_core\_ring\_manager:get\_my\_ring().
Partitions = [P || {P, '
r...@node4.domain.com
'} &lt;- riak\_core\_ring:all\_owners(Ring)].


We are running on 2.2.5
Guido.
