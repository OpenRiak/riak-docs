Hello Folks,

Welcome to a new year, the first Riak Recap of 2017 and a bunch of Riak
related content. Hope you all had a great couple of weeks and are ready to
ease into January with a few blog posts while steeping in some new features
and updates in the Riak ecosystem.

Are you working on something Riak related? Let me know and I’ll get your
talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap. Perhaps your project
could be featured on our blog [0].


## Announcements


 -

 Adam Wray, Basho’s CEO, talks IoT, edge computing and competition with
 diginomica [1].
 -

 Kait Carter highlights 2016 at Basho Academy and walks us through what’s
 to come in 2017 [2], for example a brand new course: “Load Balancing a Riak
 Cluster” [3].
 -

 Chris Mancini takes us through the ins and outs of Riak’s new data type,
 the fabled HyperLogLog or HLL for short [4]. The post also links a deeper
 dive on HLL’s by Zeeshan Lakhani (pdf) [5]. You want this data in your base!
 -

 Randy Secrist reminded me to let everyone know to check out the latest
 Riak Explorer which adds Riak TS 1.5 functionality [6]. (And is also pretty
 cool.)
 -

 Riak Spark Connector 1.6.2 brings a couple of fixes, please upgrade
 [7][8].
 -

 Jason Voegele will be giving a talk at CodeMash [9], Jan 12th, on
 “Dialyzer: Optimistic Type Checking for Erlang and Elixir” [10].

 few folks join in with some recommendations and a hat tip towards future
 Riak KV 2.3 functionality that should make this problem go away.

 Riak CS once his high availability HAproxy fails over [18].
