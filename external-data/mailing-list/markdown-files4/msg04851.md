Riak Recap for September 19 - 22
=========================

1) Basho, with the help of various other companies, will be heading up
the NoSQL Roadshow taking place in various cities across Europe in
November and December. Basho will be represented by Steve Vinoski and
Martin Schneider.

\* Dates, locations, and details here ---&gt; http://nosqlroadshow.com/

2) Susan Potter put the slides online from the "Dynamo: not just
datastores" talk she delivered at Strangeloop. (It was a great talk.)
Thanks, Susan!

related to Riak Search integration. Thanks, cadement!

4) Clint Shryock is giving a Riak talk next week and his slides made
it onto GitHub in advance (so I suspect that they are not yet
finished). Thanks, Clint!

5) Anyone going to Surge in Baltimore next week? Ping me if this is you.

6) Two jobs to pass along:
