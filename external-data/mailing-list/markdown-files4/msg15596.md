Hi Hristo,

Depending on your application, there are alternative ways of generating unique 
identifiers based on machine name and time — see the following:

https://github.com/twitter/snowflake 
http://www.boundary.com/blog/2012/01/flake-a-decentralized-k-ordered-unique-id-generator-in-erlang/
 


However, these mechanisms while unique, are not comparable, so you’ll need an 
arbitration mechanism if you wish to generate a total order over these 
identifiers.
