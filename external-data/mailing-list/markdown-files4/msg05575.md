Hello list,I am having troubles getting consistent results while counting keys in a small bucket containing +-33k objects. I do use secondary indexes: i.e:query = client.index(name,"$key",key\_start, key\_end)query.run()The final count is never the same being off +/- 100 records, I also tried slicing the (hashed) keys and get count of the keys in the slices varying most of the time. Cluster consists of 3 2GB linode VMs running Riak 1.0.1At the moment of querying there is no other activity that happens in the cluster, there is no ongoing transfers and riak console is clean as well.Is there anything that I am missing?Regards, ThomasRun 1:0 1 21401 2 20722 3 20633 4 2004 etc Total: 329150 1 21341 2 20652 3 20713 4 1999etc Total: 32874
