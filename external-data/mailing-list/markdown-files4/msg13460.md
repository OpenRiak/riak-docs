Hi Rob,

I believe Ryan meant to wait a second to do a Yokozuna search, not a
general Riak K/V operation.

There is more information about "read your own writes" here:

&gt; I'm not the original poster but I'm now wondering what this question means.
&gt; Under what circumstances do you have to wait 1 second before query results
&gt; are available?
&gt;
&gt; We want to always be able to run tests on our database rapidly, which
&gt; includes loading data and then immediately querying to make sure the correct
&gt; data is there. I know we've had some tests where we were not able to read
&gt; our own writes, but I thought those were fixed by making sure we used vector
&gt; clocks correctly. Is there a situation where you have to wait for an
&gt; unspecified amount of time before you can read your writes?
