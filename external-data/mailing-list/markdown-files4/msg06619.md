What is the recommended backup strategy for Riak with leveldb backends
(since just copying the data dirs seems to have issues)? Is riak-admin
backup sufficient? Will riak-admin backup also work with secondary
indexes and riak-search?

&gt; as requested, I reproduced the bug, then straced the process to track it down

&gt;
&gt; /var/lib/riak/leveldb/274031556999544297163190906134303066185487351808
&gt;
&gt; Attaching all the non sst data files in that directory for you to look over. 
&gt; Some of the highlights:

&gt; At this point one or more of the nodes will start misbehaving, and you will 
&gt; see the data directory grow at the rate of about 100 MB per second until it 
&gt; fills up the disk or until you restart riak on that node.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The disk usage problem was caused by a bug in LevelDB -- this should be fixed 
&gt; as part of the 1.1 release (and the RCs). I believe the root problem you're 
&gt; seeing, however, is that if you snapshot when a new version of the MANIFEST 
&gt; file is being written, you can get a partial dump of data from leveldb and 
&gt; the repair will fail on restart. If you can recreate this problem and send me 
&gt; the LOG file (generated by leveldb in the vnode data dir), I'd be curious to 
&gt; see what it says.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
