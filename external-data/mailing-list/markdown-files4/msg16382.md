Hi Hao,


Looks like you might be running into an EMFILE error:

What’s the open files limit on your nodes?


Thanks,
Alex

I am running it on a single node.

Using Erlang riak client. I added a map bucket type, create a new index, set 
the index on a bucket, saved a few map data into the bucket. Then I did some 
search. All good. Then I can remember I tried a invalid search query like 
"title\_s\_register:[New movie one]" which shuts down Riak. But it may or may not 
be the first time Riak starts to shut down. I can't remember.

Now Riak itself shut down after running a few minutes. I must have done 
something really wrong. Any idea what I can do? I have tired to restore bitcask 
data folder from a backup from days ago. It didn't help. It still crashes.

The console.log is here : http://www.pastebin.ca/3092510 
The error begins at Line 172

Anyone can help? Much appreciated.
