Dmitri,

yes, I have AAE turned on and this discussion seems relevant to my case.
As far as I have understood I have to wait for every tree to expire
after changing expiry\_secs setting (which should be less than a week).
But according to 'riak-admin aee-status' entropy tree built time is
less than 3 days for every partition while setting change had been
made earlier. And only one node actually dropped its memory
consumption by now. Am I missing something?

May be turning AEE off (at least for some time) will help me to reduce
memory consumption since no trees with expired keys at all would be
built?

&gt; Alexander, quick question - do you have Active Anti-Entropy turned on? If
&gt; yes, check out this discussion:
&gt; http://riak-users.197444.n3.nabble.com/Active-Anti-Entropy-with-Bitcask-Key-Expiry-td4027688.html
&gt; (might shed more light on the matter).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; is there a cheap way to figure out the number of keys stored in a bucket?
&gt; No. You can do a streaming list keys, which is less expensive than listing
&gt; keys used to be, but I'm not sure that counts as cheap.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; how long does it take to purge old keys from the storage?
&gt; This depends on how often Bitcask merges are performed. The expired keys are
&gt; actually removed from disk when merging/compaction occurs (though until
&gt; then, they will return as not found to client requests).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; is it possible to see how many keys were expired for the last
&gt;&gt; minute/hour/day?
&gt; I don't think so - Bitcask doesn't send any notification to Riak when it
&gt; expires the keys, and I don't think it keeps any records of its own.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; we're using Riak 1.3.1 with a Bitcask storage engine on a 4 node cluster.
&gt;&gt; Properties of the bucket used:
&gt;&gt; {"props":{"allow\_mult":false,"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; basic\_quorum":false,"big\_vclock":50,"chash\_keyfun":{"mod":"riak\_core\_util","fun":"chash\_std\_keyfun"},"dw":"quorum","last\_write\_wins":false,"linkfun":{"mod":"riak\_kv\_wm\_link\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\_linkfun"},"n\_val":2,"name":"c","notfound\_ok":true,"old\_vclock":86400,"postcommit":[],"pr":0,"precommit":[],"pw":0,"r":"one","rw":"quorum","small\_vclock":50,"w":"one","young\_vclock":20}}
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3 nodes crashed today morning almost simultaneously, fourth node had
&gt;&gt; crashed earlier this nignt. It's hard to figure out the reason of the crash
&gt;&gt; looking into the logs, but I suppose this is due to insufficient RAM
&gt;&gt; available on the servers (this maillist doesn't like big attachments but I
&gt;&gt; can send logs if it will help).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Actually, I'm dealing with Riak memory usage for some time already. Some
&gt;&gt; time ago I figured out that memory usage is much more than it is promised in
&gt;&gt; the documentation
&gt;&gt; (http://riak-users.197444.n3.nabble.com/memory-consumption-td4028674.html).
&gt;&gt; After that I tried to reduce number of keys stored, changing the expiry\_secs
&gt;&gt; setting from 2 months to 1 month. I expected the memory usage to drop in
&gt;&gt; half because new keys are put into Riak at a approximately same rate for
&gt;&gt; last two months and Bitcask stores all keys in memory. But that didn't
&gt;&gt; happen. Memory usage have dropped a little but grew again in a few days.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So the questions are:
&gt;&gt; \* is there a cheap way to figure out the number of keys stored in a
&gt;&gt; bucket?
&gt;&gt; \* how long does it take to purge old keys from the storage?
&gt;&gt; \* is it possible to see how many keys were expired for the last
&gt;&gt; minute/hour/day?
&gt;&gt; \* are there some other ways to reduce memory usage I'm missing except for
&gt;&gt; adding new servers?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance.
