Hey Francisco,

I for one would be interested in learning some more specifics on how
you're using it. I suspect others might be, too...

&gt; Hey all,

&gt; Just wondering... is anyone using, or have tried out riak-ql?
&gt; https://github.com/frank06/riak-ql
&gt;
&gt; Not because I developed it -- but I'm regularly making use of it and I
&gt; think it kicks ass. Especially in the repl in combo with riak-js.
&gt;
&gt; What do you guys think?

&gt;
&gt; ps: really curious/excited about the upcoming Secondary Indices functionality
