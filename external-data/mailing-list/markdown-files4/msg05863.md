&gt; Many thanks to the Basho team (Dan Reverri and Mark Phillips in
&gt; particular) for helping to solve this. The ring was corrupted and there
&gt; was an interesting bug around legacy gossip and forced removal (see
&gt; Bug 1298: Legacy gossip / force-remove troubles ---&gt;
&gt; https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1298 )
&gt;
&gt; After some erlang console work, our ring no longer had the ghost hosts
&gt; in it, was able to settle into the new gossip mode and we were able to
&gt; shrink it.

Do you mind to post any details on this? :-) (i.e. raw console session
dump would work ;-))

I've been experiencing similar issues before, my solution was abit
more brutal and labour intensive -&gt; backup the data, clear the data
folder, bring the data back, rejoin the cluster ;-)
