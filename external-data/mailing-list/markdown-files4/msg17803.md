The size of the bucket has no real impact on the cost of a list keys operation 
because each key on the cluster must be examined to determined whether it 
resides in the relevant bucket.

&gt; Hello Riak Users
&gt; 
&gt; I have a use case where I would really like to list all keys of a bucket 
&gt; despite all the warnings about performance. The number of keys is relatively 
&gt; small - in the few thousands at the very most, Usually its no more than 100
&gt; 
&gt; I also have other buckets in the same cluster that have millions of keys and 
&gt; tens of tera bytes of data
&gt; 
&gt; Question: Will listing all keys on the small bucket adversely impact 
&gt; performance of the other larger buckets?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
