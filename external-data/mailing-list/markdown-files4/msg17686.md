Greetings Team Riak,

For your perusing this weekend we’ve got a few blog posts to distract you
from CNN’s round-the-clock Matthew coverage along with the presumably
informative mailing list recap. Stay dry out there...

Are you working on something Riak related? Sharing is caring ;) Let me know
what you’re working on and I’ll get your talk, project or blog post in the
next Riak Recap.

## Announcements


 -

 Craig Vitter writes in opensource.com, “Riak TS for time series analysis
 at scale” [0], describing his upcoming talk at All Things Open [1].
 -

 watch out for when considering a microservices based architecture [2].

 by step instruction on how to get up and running in a number of
 circumstances [3]. For those of you who have expressed interest in Riak on
 Docker, I encourage you to start with this post.
 -

 Viktoria Fordos and Csaba Hoch take us on a harrowing tale of what can
 go wrong when you’re all deployed and in production and how they reigned it
 in by using WombatOAM [4] in "Operational nightmare fun: dealing with
 misconfigured Riak Clusters" [5].
 -

 Tom Sigler & Co. put together the “Riak KV: Operations Intro” course on
 Basho Academy [6].

 The Ripple project, a modeling layer for Riak in Ruby, has been
 transferred to its own repo. Those looking to contribute are encouraged to
 do so there [8].
