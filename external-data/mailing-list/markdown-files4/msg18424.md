&gt;&gt; Hi
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have been asked to forward the below message from Martin Davies, the
&gt;&gt; CEO of Technology for bet365.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Kind Regards
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; Subject: Riak and the demise of Basho
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; I have been wanting to make you aware for a few weeks now that we have
&gt;&gt; reached an agreement, in principle, to buy all of Basho's remaining assets
&gt;&gt; (except support contracts) from the receiver. Up until this afternoon, I
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt; constrained by some confidentiality needs of the receiver and was unable
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; speak.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We have agreed a price for the assets and are almost at the end of
&gt;&gt; sorting out the legal agreement. Once this is complete, this will then
&gt;&gt; need
&gt;&gt; to be processed through the courts which, I am advised, should take a week
&gt;&gt; or so.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is our intention to open source all of Basho's products and all of
&gt;&gt; the source code that they have been working on. We'll do this as quickly
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt; we are able to organise it, and we would appreciate some input from the
&gt;&gt; community on how you would like this done.
