Riak Recap for February 17 - 22
=======================

1) Riak 1.1 was released yesterday. Jared already sent an email to the list
with details, but here a few more things worth highlighting:

\* Hacker News Comments from the release for anyone who is interested ---&gt;
http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3616808
\* Glen Hinkle put together a short screencast on getting control up and
running. http://www.screenr.com/4MIs (One small error to point out: he sets
the HTTPS and Handoff ports to the same number. You'll not want to do this.)
\* We also added some docs to the wiki for Control ---&gt;
http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Control.html

2) An overview of Riak popped up on addconf.ru that might be of interest
our Russian readers (or anyone who can use Chrome's "Translate" button).

\* Read here ---&gt; http://www.addconf.ru/event.sdf/ru/add\_3/authors/661/662

3) There is a question up on Stack Overflow about storing images in Riak
with the PHP client that needs some love for anyone who is feeling
inspired.

\* Check it out here ---&gt;
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9394706/storing-images-with-riak-using-php-client

4) I just wanted to take a second to say congrats to the team at Kiip.me
who put Riak into production today. They've been doing some great work on
the Python client so it's the least I could.

\* 140 characters worth of details here ---&gt;

# Contributions

1) Marc Campbell made a small fix to the Erlang HTTP Client. (They all
count!)
