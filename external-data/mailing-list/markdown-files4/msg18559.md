There are some changes to the format of AAE tree data, if you have AAE enabled. 
 IIRC, AAE tree upgrades will not kick in until all nodes in the cluster are 
upgraded to 2.2 or later, but they will kick in automatically, once full 
upgrade is detected. You can disable the new AAE format, but this is not 
recommended.

&gt; Can I perform a rolling upgrade as described in the docs
&gt; 
&gt; - Stop riak
&gt; - Backup /etc /data /basho-patches
&gt; - Remove /basho-patches
&gt; - Upgrade from 2.14 -&gt; 2.2.3
&gt; - Start riak
&gt; - Verify the version 
&gt; - Wait for the service to start and complete hinted handoffs
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
