I'm pretty sure that Baho would recommend that all nodes in a cluster should be 
running the same version. An upgrade would probably require doing a full 
database backup and a full database restore on a \*new\* cluster.

&gt; Hey folks,
&gt; 
&gt; What is the proper way to upgrade a cluster from 0.12 to 0.13? Our 4 node 
&gt; cluster was originally created by installing the 0.12 rpms. Is the process 
&gt; as simple as stopping riak on a node, installing the new rpm and 
&gt; re-starting? Is it possible to roll through each node one at a time while 
&gt; the others are still available, or do all nodes need to be halted and 
&gt; upgraded at the same time? I have backed up the /etc/riak directory to save 
&gt; the initial config data. Are the 0.12 config files fully compatible with 
&gt; 0.13?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Scott
