Hi Daniel,

Sorry for the delay here.

It looks like it's going to take a more investigation to nail down the
cause. Engel just opened an issue you can keep an eye on:

https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/305

Thanks for reporting. Feel free to add any relevant information to the
issue.

Mark

&gt;&gt; Just to add to that.
&gt;&gt; Further test shows that 2i searches aso suffer form the problem of not
&gt;&gt; showing all results durring active vnode transfer.
&gt;&gt; Is this a known issue with Riak 1.2.1? Has it been solved in 1.3?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyone else experienced that? I guess attaching a node would trigger that
&gt;&gt; as well, maybe in less severe way.
&gt;&gt; Also I've read somewhere that you should attach one node at a time to
&gt;&gt; Riak cluster, and wait until vnode transfer completes.
&gt;&gt; I think it's no longer true in 1.2 since you have a plan that you commit,
&gt;&gt; but attaching a node and shuffling vnodes will cause problem described
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What is the solution here? Waiting until vnode transfer finishes is not
&gt;&gt; acceptable (availability) and recent findings show it may take a while on
&gt;&gt; big clusters.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Regards

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm aware that listing keys is not for production.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm using it mainly during testing, which started to be unreliable after
&gt;&gt;&gt; changes described above.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; What I was not expecting at all was that some of the keys won't be
&gt;&gt;&gt; listed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if that is stated in documentation to tell the truth.
&gt;&gt;&gt; To me it looks like it should be called 'listSomeKeys'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; About alternatives.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Some time ago I did comparison of listing and 2i and MapReduce and
&gt;&gt;&gt; surprisingly listing was quickest.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure why it was happening. I did similar tests today and what I
&gt;&gt;&gt; got is:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000 keys, grouped with 2i into 10 equal groups, each value &lt; 1kB
&gt;&gt;&gt; Listing:
&gt;&gt;&gt; - via listkeys 276ms
&gt;&gt;&gt; - via keyindex $key: 255ms
&gt;&gt;&gt; - via 2i (10 calls), total 2480ms
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; So for that simple case 2i is 10 times slower.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Further test shows that 100k keys (100 groups, 1000 each) gives query
&gt;&gt;&gt; response between 250-5500ms.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not good. It's almost silly NOT to use listing keys.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I may need to do that test on different hardware to compare. At the
&gt;&gt;&gt; moment I'm using just one 7200rpm HDD for Riak db.
