Hi Mark,
Riak admin reports 6 (out of 15 nodes) with 25-30% free memory, 3 nodes
with 8-10% and 6 nodes with 18-20%.
This unequal distribution forces us to add new nodes relatively fast.

Cheers
Nitish

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We have Riak cluster running 1.1.2. All the nodes own 6.6% of partitions,
&gt;&gt; still memory usage of "beam" process on some nodes is less than the others
&gt;&gt; (significantly). The number of keys on the nodes consuming less memory is
&gt;&gt; also fewer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Can you add some more color to "significantly"? That would help us
&gt; diagnose things.
