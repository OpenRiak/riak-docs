Sure, as long as your working set fits in ram or you set up a sharing system in 
front of your redis cache.

&gt; What about caching with redis? That seems to be a popular option as well.

&gt; Honestly, I wouldn't use stock Riak for this; the MR times will become 
&gt; prohibitive over billions of records. However, jrecursive has been solving a 
&gt; very similar set of problems at Showyou, and wrote Mecha, a solr/leveldb 
&gt; backend for Riak. Mecha provides fast, distributed querying on top of Riak's 
&gt; redundancy/distribution. There's a talk at the next Riak Meetup on the 23rd, 
&gt; and we should be releasing then as well.
