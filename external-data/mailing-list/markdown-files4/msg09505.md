If you are looking install and /etc/init.d support, you should really just
be installing the packages.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/riak/CURRENT/rhel/6/riak-1.2.1-1.el6.x86\_64.rpmis
the package for Centos 6 found here
http://basho.com/resources/downloads/. Building from source is there for
those who need a feature not currently in a release, want to make additions
to Riak, or are on an unsupported platform.

&gt; Cluster-Setup/which

&gt; performed all of the steps outlined in setting up a cluster how do I make
&gt; sure that this configuration is restored when the machine reboots. I am
&gt; assuming that it will involve something with /etc/init.d. Is there
&gt; something like 'make install' that would shorten the process? How is the
&gt; cluster information persisted so that each node will join the cluster when
&gt; the respective machine comes up after a reboot? Thank you.
