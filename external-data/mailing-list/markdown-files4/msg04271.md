Riak Recap for August 5 - 7
====================

1) Joe Lambert (@cyborgpirates) wrote a short piece for his blog
about using streaming list keys.

\* Read here ---&gt;

Thanks, Joe!

2) Brett Hoerer has a new project up on GitHub called "timak," a
Python library for storing activity streams in Riak. It's "very alpha
and rough around the edges" but you're probably going to want to keep
an eye on it.

\* Code here ---&gt; https://github.com/bretthoerner/timak

Thanks, Brett!

3) We posted the video from the "Riak at Formspring" talk that was
delivered a few weeks back at the San Francisco Riak Meetup. This one
is well worth the 28 minutes.

\* Read and watch here ---&gt;

4) Perhaps a bit off-topic for the Recap but I figured I would pass
this along: Basho is hiring a UX Designer.

\* If this is you or someone you know, get in touch with us ---&gt;

5) Q --- Are riak keys/buckets case sensitive, or in other words, is
the key "MyKey" and "mykey" the same? (from oal via #riak)

 A --- Yes. They are case-sensitive; just treated as binaries (byte buffers).

6) One job to pass along:

 \* Comcast is hiring a Sr. Systems Admin with Riak experience ---&gt;
