Hi,

I am experimenting with riak cluster. I set it up with a three nodes with 
default config values. But would like to change some of the values. I read riak 
doc, which mentions that configs should be set up before cluster is running. So 
I tried to 'undo' the cluster. Riak-admin cluster leave only worked up to 2 
nodes. Essentially the cluster is still running. How do I start a new cluster 
from scratch?

Thanks,

Kathleen Zhang
