Jens,

That's great to hear! Also, if you still want to use HTTP, setting the 
"disable\_http\_nagle" option to true in app.config should improve request 
latency. See http://wiki.basho.com/Configuration-Files.html#disable\_http\_nagle

&gt; The problem seems to have been HTTP overhead, even though I was running 11 
&gt; processes. Using procotol buffers yielded a much better (and realistic) 
&gt; performance around ~2900 inserts/second. Please see my previous response in 
&gt; this same thread for more info.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,

&gt; Jens,
&gt; 
&gt; Based on the numbers you shared for latencies (http://pastebin.com/L1mwThPA), 
&gt; it seems you are not maxing out the cluster. I'd suggest running your inserts 
&gt; in multiple client processes or on multiple machines to get greater 
&gt; throughput.
