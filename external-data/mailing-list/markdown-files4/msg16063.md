Hi Alex,

Riak allocates data to nodes evenly - it doesn't take into account free
space. You should just be able to upgrade all nodes to 1Tb and Riak will
use the space, without needing to take any additional actions.

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; I have the following question about scaling up vertically upgrading HDs to
&gt; get more space. I have the understanding that if HDs are of different sizes
&gt; on ring creation, they get the smallest size of them all and make all nodes
&gt; even, for example:
&gt;
&gt; Node 1: 500GB
&gt; Node 2: 500GB
&gt; Node 3: 750GB
&gt; Node 4: 500GB
&gt; Node 5: 750GB
&gt;
&gt; In this case riak would make a parity of 500GB per node... so... how could
&gt; we scale up the HDs? Imagine I want to turn them into the following:
&gt;
&gt; Node 1: 1TB
&gt; Node 2: 1TB
&gt; Node 3: 1TB
&gt; Node 4: 1TB
&gt; Node 5: 1TB
&gt;
&gt; How can you rebalance the cluster in the way their partitions grow to fit
&gt; this new setup? (using Riak 2.1)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Alex
