Has anyone had any (recent) experience with changing from a single backend 
cluster (eLevelDB for us) to multi-backend?

We'd like to add a bucket backed by the memory backend to our existing cluster 
with as minimal impact as possible.

Can we set:
 storage\_backend =&gt; riak\_kv\_multi\_backend
and:
 multi\_backend\_default =&gt; eleveldb backend

and then restart each node without impacting the current bucket(s) on eLevelDB, 
and then subsequently create/switch a new bucket to the memory backend?

If not, is this a tried and true process for an offline cluster?

Thanks,
Tom
