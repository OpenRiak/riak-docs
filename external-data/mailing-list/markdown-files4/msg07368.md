&gt;&gt; Trade offs. I dislike rewriting stuff that doesn't scale. I love the
&gt;&gt; idea of just throwing another box into a cluster and having it "just
&gt;&gt; work" without rebalancing issues, etc. I'm tired of dealing with shards,
&gt;&gt; complex replication setups, etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I will also be using heavily for logging, URL shortening, social share
&gt;&gt; registering, etc., and I'd rather stick to one datastore.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I agree it's a bit of a round peg in a ovoid hole when it comes to
&gt;&gt; geospatial + mapreduce queries, but I imagine it won't be long until
&gt;&gt; geospatial indexes arrive at Riak as well, and then I can switch to
&gt;&gt; those. :-)

&gt; Mecha. Coming soon. Talk to jrecursive.

Very interesting... but how soon? I could really use this.
