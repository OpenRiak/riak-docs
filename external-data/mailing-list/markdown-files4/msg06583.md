Riak Recap for February 8 - 9
======================

1) Sean Cribbs made a short screencast to demonstrate the custom
serializers feature in the latest Ruby client release.

\* Watch here ---&gt;

2) For anyone in/around France - the CFP for Devoxx France closes in four
days. If you're in the area and want to tell the tech community how much
you love (or hate) Riak, now is your chance. (And if you end up submitting
a talk, let me know so that I can say thanks.)

\* Details here ---&gt; https://cfp.devoxx.fr/

3) We added an Events page to the Community section of basho.com that might
be of interest to some of you.
