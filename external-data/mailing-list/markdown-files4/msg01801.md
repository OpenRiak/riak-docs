2) I stumbled onto a short but worthwhile post on a blog called
"Venalis" that talked a bit about Riak and riak-js (riakjs.org).

Post here ---&gt; http://blog.venalis.net/2010/12/duck-tape.html

4) @lusis (John E. Vincent) wrote a post called "Chef and encrypted
data bags" that examined using Riak (and a few other solutions) for a
data encryption problem.

5) Basho hacker Jon Meredith gave a tech talk at the Pivotal Labs
Office in Boulder, CO a few weeks ago.

His slides are here ---&gt; http://www.slideshare.net/jonmeredith/riak-intro

6) aphyr, seancribbs, and Tv had a convo about incrementing counters
using Riak.

7) Sean Cribbs pushed some code to support nascent key filters in Ripple.

8) Last but certainly not least, Daniel Lindsley contributed a huge
and truly-excellent chunk of documentation for the Python client that
we just merged into the Basho repo.
