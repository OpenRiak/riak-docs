Hi Norman,

It's still the case. Riak KV was designed to be highly available, and
highly scalable key/value store with predictable low latency. This lets
you scale to a few or as many machines as needed, while removing any single
failure points that a single-machine database or cache might impose.

We unfortunately don't have connectors for every language / platform /
framework combination, the explosive exponential swath of support would be
exhausting. We do keep well maintained client libraries
, and
community libraries and plugins are always growing in number. I think
Luke's suggestion would provide a good way forward, and we'd be happy to
help with any questions you have along the way.

Thanks,
Alex

&gt; hi luke, thanks for the reply, in the riak document "Riak KV is uniquely
&gt; architected to handle user and session data..." or is this no longer the
&gt; case?

&gt; &gt; Hi Norman,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A quick search turns up this Node.js module:
&gt; &gt; https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is currently not a session store for Riak
&gt; &gt; (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session#compatible-session-stores
&gt; )
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Since memcached operates as a key/value store, forking the connector
&gt; &gt; for that session store as a starting point would be your best bet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; https://github.com/balor/connect-memcached
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You would then use the Riak Node.js client to fetch and store data:

&gt; &gt; &gt; store the logged in users' sessions as detailed

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; i have setup the dev cluster on my machine and everything is running
&gt; fine.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; what is the correct way to set this up?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; any advise much appreciated.
