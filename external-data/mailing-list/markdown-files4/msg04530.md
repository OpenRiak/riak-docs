No, you can't control SST rollover (that I've seen), but you can
control how many file descriptors are in use, per-vnode. In the
section for eleveldb in app.config add the directive:

{max\_open\_files, N}

Note that this will restrict number of open handles \_per vnode\_, so
you'll still need to ensure that your ulimit -n is set higher than #
of vnodes \* max\_open\_files. Also note that this may affect performance
if set too low, since it will require the system to open/close files
rapidly.

Ultimately, the reason innostore was slow was likely due to the fact
that if you were not inserting in sorted order, it was a worst case
scenario for updating the b-tree. LevelDB gets around this by
discarding the b-tree idea altogether in exchange for slightly higher
whole-tree traversal and less cache-locality in that scenario. Seems
like a reasonable tradeoff in all the testing I've done. :)
