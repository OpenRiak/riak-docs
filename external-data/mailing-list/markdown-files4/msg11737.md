Code never sleeps. And it mostly comes at night. Mostly.

Now that v1.4.0 of the RJC is released we're back to working on v2.0.
It's a major overhaul of the client.

The one large change we're looking at is no longer using HTTP and
instead exclusively using Protocol Buffers to communicate with Riak.

I've posted an RFC here:
https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client/issues/268 and encourage
everyone to participate.

Thanks!
Brian Roach
