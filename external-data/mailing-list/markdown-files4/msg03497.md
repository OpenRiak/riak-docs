Hey,

So I thought I had a working haproxy configuration with protobuffers (It worked 
once upon a time, but no longer) so I was wondering if anyone had any working 
examples?


irb(main):001:0&gt; client = Riak::Client.new(:protocol =&gt; "pbc")
=&gt; #
irb(main):002:0&gt; client.ping
Riak::ProtobuffsFailedRequest: Expected success from Riak but received 
server\_error. Unexpected EOF on PBC socket


irb(main):008:0&gt; client2=Riak::Client.new(:protocol =&gt; "pbc", :host =&gt; 
"10.170.121.116")
=&gt; #
irb(main):009:0&gt; client2.ping
=&gt; true


If I remove all the servers except for 1 connects but still doesn't really 
work, below is my haproxy configuration I hope it helps.

 listen riak\_pbc :8087
 mode tcp
 server app-0 ip-10-170-121-116.us-west-1.compute.internal:8087 check inter 
5000 fastinter 1000 fall 1 weight 50
 server app-1 ip-10-171-43-226.us-west-1.compute.internal:8087 check inter 
5000 fastinter 1000 fall 1 weight 50
 server app-2 ip-10-170-142-202.us-west-1.compute.internal:8087 check inter 
5000 fastinter 1000 fall 1 weight 50

Actual full haproxy erb chef template can be found here 
https://github.com/damm/ey-riak/blob/master/templates/default/haproxy.cfg.erb 
(if you see anything I should turn off for http please let me know and be 
gentle)

Thanks!
