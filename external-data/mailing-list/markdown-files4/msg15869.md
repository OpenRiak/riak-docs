All,

I've been working on a Riak setup with Search (version 2.0.0), 2 custom
schemas for 3 datatypes (maps of sets, wanted to query against values of
these sets, one of the schemas stores one of these sets, but there's max 2
values in that particular one per record).

Everything seemed to be running smoothly up to one day, when all of a
sudden Solr started throwing OutOfMemoryErrors. I have increased the max
allocated memory from the default 1g to 2g, then 3g, but that did not help.

Is there a routine to be done in such cases?

Kind regards,
Cezary
