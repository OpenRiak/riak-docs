Thanks Brian, I suspected it was a constraint applied in the client tools
(although in my case the Python ones).

&gt; This has never been a restriction in Riak itself AFAIK. I fixed the
&gt; same issue in the Java client over a year ago - it was using a hashmap
&gt; for links so duplicates were discarded;

&gt; &gt; Basho guys, can I get a confirmation on the uniqueness of links between
&gt; two
&gt; &gt; objects please? (Before I go an modify the code in my app to suit)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello list,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Once upon a time, a link from one object to another was unique - you
&gt; &gt;&gt; couldn't add two links from object A onto object B. I know this as I
&gt; had to
&gt; &gt;&gt; code around it in our app.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; At some stage that limitation has been removed - in either the Python
&gt; &gt;&gt; bindings or Riak itself.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Can anyone else confirm this? Basho peeps, are non-unique links the
&gt; &gt;&gt; intended behaviour?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt;&gt; Matt Black
