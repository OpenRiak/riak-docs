Hi,

we want to save plenty of mails in riak which are in average 14k big. Our 
cluster will become between 10 to 20 nodes so the question is: what is better, 
having more partitions but each has less cache or is it the other way around so 
having less partitions with more cache size?

Also with an n\_val of 3 it is always said, that there is no guarantee for 
having this on 3 physical nodes but also that it should be distributed evenly. 
What does it mean? Is there any calculation I can do to get a feeling how often 
3 replicas are only on 2 nodes? Or can you say: with 6 nodes and an n\_val of 3 
it should be the case that almost 99.9 percent is distributed over different 
physical nodes?

Cheers,
Simon
