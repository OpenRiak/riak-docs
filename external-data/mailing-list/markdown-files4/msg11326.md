&gt; By default AWS machines use NAT, they provide a temporary external IP

&gt; You can also permanantly assign an 'elastic IP address' if you want a
&gt; particular instance to always be reachable on a specific IP.

&gt; When you put that public IP in the riak config file, it makes no sense
&gt; to Riak because that IP isn't applied to any interface it knows about.
&gt; When you put the private IP in, it works, but you can't access it. This
&gt; is probably because AWS is dropping inbound traffic by default:

&gt;
&gt; This is not a Riak problem, it is an issue with configuring AWS.
