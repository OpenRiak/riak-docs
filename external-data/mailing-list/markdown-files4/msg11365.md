You got it. After pushing 1.4 out the door in a few days, we're considering
adding in support for switching out Riak Search for Yokozuna.

Your use of cURL (the most full featured Riak client EVARâ„¢) made me curious
whether or not there was support for PBC yet within your yokozuna code.
I'll hit you up directly should I run into any weirdness.

&gt; Yokozuna supports protobuff already. It uses the same protocol as current
&gt; Riak Search so it is currently limited to that feature set. It should
&gt; "just work". However, currently, if both Riak Search and Yokozuna are
&gt; enabled then Riak Search will handle all queries.

&gt; Are you asking in regards to CorrugatedIron by chance?

&gt;&gt; What level of PBC integration can we expect from Yokozuna? Is that
&gt;&gt; developed but not documented or is that a TBA feature?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Riak Users,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Today I'm excited to bring you the 0.7.0 release of Yokozuna. It
&gt;&gt;&gt; includes some new features such as an upgrade to Solr 4.3.0, isolation of
&gt;&gt;&gt; index failures, one-to-many index-to-buckets relationship, and map-reduce
&gt;&gt;&gt; support. There is also a performance improvement in index throughput.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Along with several bug fixes. See the release notes for more detail.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/master/docs/RELEASE\_NOTES.md#070
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Once again I have forgone the EC2 AMI. Only a source package is
&gt;&gt;&gt; available. You can find instructions for installing on the INSTALL page.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; For those that have been using Yokozuna. The one-to-many change is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; breaking change. Creating an index no longer implicitly indexes the bucket
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the same name. Two steps must be performed. FIrst you create the
&gt;&gt;&gt; index as before. Second you add a bucket property 'yz\_index' whose value
&gt;&gt;&gt; is the name of the index you wish to index that bucket under. There is an
&gt;&gt;&gt; example in the README.
