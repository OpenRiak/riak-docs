Fellow Riak Core enthusiasts,

Here's my first post on Riak Core, another one soon to follow. This mainly
goes over my fork of J. Newland's rebar\_riak\_core template which I've added
to and named "multinode." Basically, the multinode template allows you to
get a Riak Core based cluster up-and-running quickly. Those with a keen eye
might notice that it looks suspiciously like the structure found in Riak :)

Please, especially Basho guys, offer comments and criticism. The last thing
I want is to confuse matters with bad info.

P.S. +1 on a Riak Core webcast that touches on some of the finer details.

&gt; The topic I'd really like coverage is, what can riak-core do that other
&gt; stack including erlang+otp can't do.
&gt;
&gt; Basically, what awesome unique sauce does it bring to the table that you
&gt; would want to ditch your favorite stack?
