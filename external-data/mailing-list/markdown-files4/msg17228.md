Hi there,

Can somebody give some answers to this? I really want to know if Riak TS is
something for me to use or i'm better with Riak KV.

Thanks,
Alex

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; I had been building a project for a while (i got stuck with work and kinda
&gt; got delayed for a year until now that i could resume it) and I was planning
&gt; to use the following setup (the project is a social network... so imagine
&gt; something like Facebook)
&gt;
&gt; - Riak CS: Video storage and streaming
&gt; - Riak KV: Everything else... Users, Profiles, Photos, Statuses, Likes,
&gt; Counters, etc...
&gt;
&gt; For what I've seen now, Riak CS is gone; I guess it was replaced by Riak
&gt; S2... and now there is the new Riak TS. Now I wonder if Riak TS could be
&gt; good for my project and what use case I could really give it (maybe user's
&gt; status updates?)
&gt;
&gt; However, in this situation I could think of:
&gt;
&gt; - Riak S2: Video storage and streaming (photo storage too)
&gt; - Riak TS: Statuses, Updates, News, etc...
&gt; - Riak KV: Users, Profiles, Settings
&gt;
&gt; Is this something to think of going forward? Also... would I require a
&gt; cluster of at least 5 servers for each Riak variant?? That would require a
&gt; minimum of 15 servers just to start!... a bit too much.
&gt;
&gt; Can somebody enlighten me a little on this new Riak TS? Also, is not yet
&gt; available to download/test?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Alex
