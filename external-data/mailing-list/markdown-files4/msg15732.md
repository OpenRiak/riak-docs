Hi all,

I seem to have trouble with aae on riak 2.0.4. Specifically the search aae.
When I run the command 'riak-admin aae-status' everything seems fine but if
I run the same command for search (riak-admin search aae-status) it seem
like the search entropy trees have never been built and never do. All I get
on every field is --.

Any command I can run to force the trees to be built so I get consistent
search results?

Steve
