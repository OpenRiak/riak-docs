Are you saying sending the write to two clusters in the client
wouldn't end up with the same data in both? I assume that's because it
wouldn't guarantee the same conflict resolution on both?

&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Given replication is a built-in feature only in the EnterpriseDS
&gt;&gt; product, how are folks using only the open source version of Riak
&gt;&gt; handling replication? Writing to two clusters simultaneously or
&gt;&gt; something else perhaps?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thank you in advance.
