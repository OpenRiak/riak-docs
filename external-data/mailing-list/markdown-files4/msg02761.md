I was going to make this part of today's Recap, but upon further
thinking I concluded that it might deserve its own thread...

@wmacgyver, @russelldb, and some others exchanged a few messages on
Twitter yesterday about what dev setup they are using for their
respective Riak work.

wmacgyver's response was: "3 macmini server 2.66ghz with 8gb, raid 1
500gb=your own ec2 7.5gb node with 500gb ebs. Every dev has a set."

Anyone else care to share their setup? Or have any questions about
what your dev setup should look like?

Mark
