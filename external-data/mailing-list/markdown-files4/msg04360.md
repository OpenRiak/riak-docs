Hi Dimitry. Looks like you are correct. Key listing works with eleveldb, but 
bucket listing does not seem to be working. The master branch is under a lot of 
development at the moment and there is already a fix for this under review. So 
it should be resolved soon.

&gt; Hello.

&gt; I've failed with leveldb backend in riak. I'm able to put values to storage, 
&gt; but I cannot take buckets' list. Rekon also show nothing in buckets' list.
&gt; Is that expected behavior (eleveldb backend is unstable as far as I can see) 
&gt; or did I something wrong?
