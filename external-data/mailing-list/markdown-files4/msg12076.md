Thanks Hector for the clarification, what I needed to know.

&gt; Hi James,
&gt; 
&gt; Although it is possible to interact with Riak and Riak CS on same
&gt; cluster, we'll generally recommend that you use one Riak cluster to
&gt; back CS and another for standard Riak usage.
&gt; 
&gt; You can store any application data in Riak CS. Just be aware that
&gt; you'll lose some of the query mechanisms Riak provides like secondary
&gt; indexes, search, and Map/Reduce.

&gt;&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I was wonder firstly if you could run Riak for application data and Riak CS 
&gt;&gt; on the same production cluster or would you need two independent clusters?
&gt;&gt; Also could you use Riak CS for your application data?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think that I would need to run Riak and Riak CS on independent clusters 
&gt;&gt; and that I can't use Riak CS for my application data. Just looking for 
&gt;&gt; clarification.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Cheers,
