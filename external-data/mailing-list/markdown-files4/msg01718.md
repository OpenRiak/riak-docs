We've looked at these recently and they're not exactly prime time.
They don't even compile on Mac OS X without a lot of prodding, at
least with our configuration. I think they also require some
development version of 0mq. That said, would be more than happy if
someone fixes these problems and builds something cool with it.

I don't think there's really any communication in the Riak model that
would benefit from better multicast. Maybe some ring stuff, but not
the reads or writes.

&gt;&gt; A quick follow up - it seems RabbitMQ now supports 0MQ [1][2] which might
&gt;&gt; be a good fit with Riak
&gt;&gt; From the blog post [1]:
&gt;&gt; "0MQ is bundled with OpenPGM library which implements a reliable mutlicast
&gt;&gt; protocol called PGM. The r0mq bridge thus allows to multicast messages from
&gt;&gt; RabbitMQ broker to the clients (0MQ clients to be precise — AMQP has no
&gt;&gt; multicast support). This kind of functionality is extremely useful in
&gt;&gt; scenarios where a lot of identical data is passed to many boxes on the LAN.
&gt;&gt; If a separate copy of each datum is sent to each subscriber, you can easily
&gt;&gt; exceed capacity of your network. With multicast, data is sent once only to
&gt;&gt; all the subscribers thus keeping the bandwidth usage constant even when the
&gt;&gt; number of subscribers grows."

&gt;&gt;&gt; Does/can Riak use PGM [1] for replicating writes ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems PGM would be more efficient when the number of physical nodes
&gt;&gt;&gt; starts to get high.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Just curious!
