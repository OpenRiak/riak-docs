It's worth noting that you can use an objects primary key as the source for
a 2i query. This is helpful if you want a known range of keys in a bucket.

&gt; Seriously though, keylists are at least non-blocking in 1.0, so the
&gt; vnodes aren't prevented from doing any reads/writes while the keylist is
&gt; running. However, remember that a keylist of any kind that isn't on a
&gt; single vnode (the way riak does keylists internally is all per vnode)
&gt; requires a traversal of ALL the keyspace, even if your bucket only has
&gt; 10 things in it.
