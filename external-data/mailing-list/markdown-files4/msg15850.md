I not have stable reproduce but peaks happens several times in day and
takes 10-50 sec.
some times it happens on very low traffic, so I think it not related on
traffic.
Looks like query is locked somehow.
What can I do for troubleshoot peaks? Enable addition logs or Monitoring ?
There is no errors in logs at time of the peaks
