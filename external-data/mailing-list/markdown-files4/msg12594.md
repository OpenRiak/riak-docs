Hi Daniel,

You mentioned this was running on three servers simultaneously. Is it
possible that two of the bucket property updates were truly concurrent? If
so, an implementation detail of bucket properties: they are last-write-wins
(and unfortunately the resolution is in milliseconds)\*. So its feasible
that in some cases the allow\_mult=false would win.

Cheers,
Jordan

\*this is something we plan to address in future releases.

&gt; I found a place in my code where allow\_mult is switched to false (during
&gt; boot) and then back to true. After removing that I could not reproduce the
&gt; problem (so far). Looks like it may be related to problems Jeremiah
&gt; reported, and allow\_mult getting stuck in false. Thanks for that hint.
