Hi,

I am setting up a new cluster. I followed all the setup instructions (I
think). I created admin user as doc says, then updated riak-cs.conf and
stanchion.conf with generated keys. I get the following when starting:

2016-05-05 01:15:01.167 [error]
&gt; &lt;0.149.0&gt;@riak\_cs\_app:fetch\_and\_cache\_admin\_creds:96 Couldn't get admin
&gt; user (LMTLWU8QZ\_UZZJ4Y541) record: {error,notfound}
&gt; 2016-05-05 01:15:01.199 [error] &lt;0.149.0&gt;@riak\_cs\_app:sanity\_check:129
&gt; Admin credentials are not properly set: notfound.


If I revert back to default ('admin.key = admin-key'), then it starts OK.
If I try to create the user again, it says the email already exists. So
it's there.

I looked at the logs and didn't find anything that seems relevant other
these entries I just posted. Can someone please help me dig into this issue?
