HI John,

Thank you! Then which backend I should choose to store images?

You certainly can with some careful tuning.
However, if Riak is being used for heavy traffic loads, youâ€™ll likely see poor 
performance as a consequence. Those large objects effectively clog the pipes 
temporarily.
Hopefully someone can chime in with tuning recommendations, but make certain 
allow\_mult is set to false; if those images end up with siblings, things can 
get very ugly.
We generally recommend Riak CS to manage the chunking of data into Riak to 
store large objects.

-John

Can I directly store images as big as 2~6MB into riak as an object?

Thank you!
