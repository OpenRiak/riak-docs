Trevor,

I don't have a FC 17 VM handy, so I can't test it, but have you tried the FC 15 
package from http://basho.com/resources/downloads/? The only problem I could 
see you having is a wrong dependency on openssl, but you should be able to 
install the matching one along side the one that installs with FC 17.

The proper erlang is bundled in the Riak packages, so you won't need Erlang 
installed otherwise. Let me know either way if it works.

&gt; I'm having troubles getting riak installed on Fedora 17. First, I tried with

&gt; It didn't work to changing the version regex everywhere I could find, though 
&gt; it's possible I missed some. Then, I built R14B03, and I get an "Uncaught

&gt; I'm not sure what to try next and could use any suggestion.
