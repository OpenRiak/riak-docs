It is not currently possible. The JavaScript VM is "sandboxed", so to speak, 
with no callbacks into Erlang with the exception of the ejsLog function (which 
I believe is actually implemented in C). If you want to delete objects from 
MapReduce, use an Erlang reduce phase like the one on contrib.basho.com.
