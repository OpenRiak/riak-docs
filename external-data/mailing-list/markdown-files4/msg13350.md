A few things that you should check:
Try Riak ping
Check ./log/console.log for problem
ps aux ( is there a beam.smp running )

try change the listening ip to 127.0.0.1 and curl to 127.0.0.1

Subject: 404 Error: Object Not Found

I've installed a single node Riak cluster using the 5 minute install 
guide and 
modified the app.config riak\_core to include {target\_n\_val, 1} and 
{default\_bucket\_props, [{n\_val, 1}]}. I've also set an IP address of 
192.168.2.25, and set the HTTP port to 10018 respectively.
With this setup, no matter what HTTP request I execute, I receive the error 
below.

Does anyone know what I've done wrong?

\* About to connect() to 192.168.2.25 port 10018 (#0)
