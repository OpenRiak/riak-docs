Why do you need such a way?

If you have some certain list of operations to perform on each object,
you can just combine them inside a body of a single map function.

If this list is dynamic and may vary depending on a situation – you
can pass the list of functions to execute as the second parameter to
the map function.

On the contrary, reduce functions cannot be combined like that – you
generally need to gather all the results of a previous reduce to get a
consistent result of the next one. So, multiple reduce functions are
not just allowed, but sometimes even necessary.

&gt; Hi all!
&gt; I want to execute a mapreduce query, in erlang, that contains two map phases
&gt; such that the Map2 function takes the result of the Map1 function as input.
&gt; Is it possible and if, what must be the return value of each map phase
&gt; Thank you!
