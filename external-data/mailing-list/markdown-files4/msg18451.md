Hi Luke,

It’s for bet365 to make that decision.

For the good of the general population the following would be nice:

a) Upgrade to rebar3 
b) Upgrade Erlang version support so it compiles under Erlang 20 (if it doesn’t 
already)
c) Package uploaded to hex.pm

&gt; Hello Riak users -
&gt; 
&gt; The next RabbitMQ release (3.7.0) will use cuttlefish for its
&gt; configuration. I'm writing to express interest on behalf of the
&gt; RabbitMQ team in taking over maintenance of the project. At the
&gt; moment, we forked cuttlefish to the RabbitMQ organization [0] to fix a
&gt; couple pressing issues. After that, it would be great if the
&gt; repository could be transferred to either its own, new organization or
&gt; to the RabbitMQ organization entirely. Basho transferred both
&gt; Webmachine and Lager to their own independent organizations, for
&gt; instance (github.com/webmachine, github.com/erlang-lager)
&gt; 
&gt; Once transferred, GitHub will take care of all the necessary
&gt; redirections from the Basho organization to cuttlefish's new home.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Luke Bakken
