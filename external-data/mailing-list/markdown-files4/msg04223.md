This isn't really about scenarios in general, just the example you gave:

&gt; One such scenario that I'd be interested in seeing, is a setup where you
&gt; have a Riak cluster with a specific node that is used for all reads/writes
&gt; of an application.
&gt; The idea is to ensure that the data is always online (via cluster), but
&gt; also ensure that you always have the latest version of your data (specific
&gt; single node read/write).
&gt; If this primary node goes down, then just switch the application to a new
&gt; primary node. That could occur via application logic or other solution that
&gt; exists between application and riak cluster.
&gt;

 Riak has no real notion of "primary" node(s), and you don't want to change
that. (Though I guess the first node in the preference list for a given hash
could be considered the "most primary"... but that's a bit different.)
Anyway, you should be able to achieve strong consistency (read your last
write) by keeping R + W &gt; N. You shouldn't think of Riak in "master slave"
terms you may be used to from your relational database of choice.
