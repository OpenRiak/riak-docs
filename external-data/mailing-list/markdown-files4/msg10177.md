For those who used the ubuntu repository, when will be able to get
it via "aptitude/apt-get"? 

Merci,

&gt; Grats team Basho! Looks great.

&gt; How
far off is a Yokozuna merge, or to put another way, how divergent is
Yokozuna 0.3 from master?

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The Basho Engineering team is thrilled to announced that Riak
1.3 is official and ready for your production systems. Without further
adieu: 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; \* Complete release notes:
https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.3/RELEASE-NOTES.md [1]
&gt;&gt; \* 1.3
downloads and documentation: http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.3.0/downloads/
[2]
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If you've been following the commits or have read the release
notes for the first four RCs, you know this release is well worth the
wait. Big ticket features and fixes include Active Anti Entropy (AAE),
MapReduce stability and speed improvements, a refacing for Riak Control,
LevelDB saw another round of significant improvements, and much more.
All told, we fixed/resolved/merged more than 170 issues and PRs. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
In addition to the release notes, we've got a blog post up on the Basho
Blog [1] with more details about 1.3. We're also doing a Riak 1.3
Webcast on March 7th [2] for anyone who is interested in getting a more
in-depth look at the release. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1.3 took a a little longer to get
out the door than was planned, but it's the most-advanced, battle-tested
Riak we've ever released and we're proud to ship it to you. Thanks for
being a supportive and active community. Your production usage,
suggestions, comments, criticisms, code contributions, and bug fixes
made this possible. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Lastly, if you want to hear all about the
future of Riak and hack alongside fellow Riak Community members for a
few days, come to RICON | EAST this May in NYC [3]. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Let us know
if you have any questions about the release and thanks for being a part
of Riak. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Now, onto 1.4...
