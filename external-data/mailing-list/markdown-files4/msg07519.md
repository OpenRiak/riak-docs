Riak is eventually consistent. Deleting it doesn't show up immediately.
There is an option like delete\_immediate

&gt; I'm seeing this pretty consistently and have no explanation for it. I
&gt; delete a large number of keys (20k to 100k), but when I then search on the
&gt; keys ($key/0/g) anywhere from 0-200 or so of the deleted keys show up in
&gt; the results. It doesn't matter how long I wait after completing the
&gt; deletion step, the keys stay in the list until I try to access the object
&gt; and then it goes away. I'm using 1.1.2 and the riak-java client, and
&gt; getting no errors on the deletion step.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for the reply. My observation does not quite match up with this
&gt;&gt; though so I'm still a bit confused. The deleted keys appeared to stay long
&gt;&gt; past the 3 seconds described in the post you referenced. In fact, I don't
&gt;&gt; know if they ever "went away". I'll run some more tests to see if I can
&gt;&gt; narrow down the exact behavior, for example not all key deletions exhibited
&gt;&gt; this behavior (the test I ran resulted in 118 residual keys out of around
&gt;&gt; 20K deletes). If I directly queried any of the keys it would respond with
&gt;&gt; "not found" and immediately stop showing up in the key list or $key index
&gt;&gt; query.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm still running a bunch of tests just to learn the behavior of the
&gt;&gt; system so I'll keep plugging away at it. For example, I'm observing that
&gt;&gt; $key index queries halt inserts into the same bucket while the query is
&gt;&gt; running, I don't know yet if this halts all server activity or just the
&gt;&gt; inserts for that bucket though.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Steve. There is no caching of key lists in riak. What you are seeing
&gt;&gt;&gt; is likely the fact that listing of keys or index queries can pick up
&gt;&gt;&gt; deleted keys due to the fact that riak keeps tombstone markers around for
&gt;&gt;&gt; deleted objects for some period. For a really good explanation of riak's
&gt;&gt;&gt; delete behavior check out this writeup by Jon Meredith:
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2011-October/006048.html.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You can set delete\_mode to immediate as described in that post and you will
&gt;&gt;&gt; most likely not see any deleted keys when you do an index query or key
&gt;&gt;&gt; list. The tradeoff is that you may get the unexpected behavior when doing
&gt;&gt;&gt; concurrent updates to the same set of keys that the delete\_mode changes
&gt;&gt;&gt; were designed to address as Jon also indicates in that post. We are
&gt;&gt;&gt; considering different options on this front, but at this time no actual
&gt;&gt;&gt; changes have been made to address this.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The last message I saw on this (from a year ago) says the caching of key
&gt;&gt;&gt; lists will be removed. I just ran into it while running a $key index range
&gt;&gt;&gt; search. I then ran a ?key=stream search on the bucket and the same stale
&gt;&gt;&gt; key list appeared (I had created a bunch of data and then deleted it as a
&gt;&gt;&gt; test). Did the caching removal not happen? I'm running 1.1.2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The query:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; curl 'localhost:8098/buckets/testbucket/index/$key/0/g'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; As others have noted, this behavior is quite disconcerting and I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; want to pepper the application with otherwise unnecessary checks for stale
&gt;&gt;&gt; keys even on 2i range queries. Or is that unavoidable?
