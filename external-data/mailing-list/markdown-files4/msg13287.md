Sorry to burst your bubble Shane, but the way we encode Riak keys in
LevelDB is going to be mostly useless in levelweb.

Nicholas: It's not ideal (list-buckets and list-keys caveats apply), but
for development purposes, you can use rekon: https://github.com/basho/rekon

&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm a riak newbie and I'm planning to use it for my next project.
&gt;&gt; It would be very useful to have a way to see inside buckets graphically
&gt;&gt; (like phpmyadmin), a project similar to riak-control but for data.
&gt;&gt; Does anybody know of something like this? Something basic is ok, I don't
&gt;&gt; need anything fancy.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If you're using LevelDB as your backend you could try Levelweb:
