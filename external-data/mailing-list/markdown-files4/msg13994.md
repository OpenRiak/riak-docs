&gt; I realize I am somewhat re-inventing the wheel. However I do not need an
"S3 interface"

Then you could just do what you are wanting in Riak. No need for low-level
access to Riak-CS, etc. You could look to CS for inspiration, I suppose.

Also, Stanchion is only needed when doing user related modifications
(someone from Basho correct me if I'm wrong).

As I said earlier, I know of a project that delivers lots (and lots and
lots and lots) of video using Riak-CS. Hopefully some details on that will
be released soon. For your use case, a custom "chunking proxy" seems fine,
however.
