HI Ryan,

Thanks! Unfortunately I can't do this on my live application. Is this going
to be fixed? Should I submit an issue to Yokozuna project at github?

&gt; &gt; I don't see anything wrong with the first record, but the second record
&gt; &gt; mentions the key '/.Trash/MT03' which is not correct, the correct key
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; exists in that bucket is
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; '/.Trash/MT03 348 plat frames'
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; You have found a bug in Yokozuna.

&gt;
&gt; It foolishly assumes there is no space character used in the type,
&gt; bucket, or key names. As a workaround I think you'll have to make sure
&gt; your application converts all spaces to some other character (like
&gt; underscore) before storing in Riak.
