My interpretation is:

- you upgraded to 1.3.x on April 3 (interesting, but not important)

- your data arrival rate since then has not been sufficient to cause any 
compactions at level-5 in almost a year

- only you can decide whether or not the age of the files implies that the data 
is no longer retrieved for use

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; You can continue to wait for the compactions to purge old data. If you are 
&gt;&gt; running Riak 1.3 or more recent, you can look at the creation date of files 
&gt;&gt; in each vnode's sst\_5 subdirectory. Those dates will give you a feel for 
&gt;&gt; how often your highest numbered levels receive compactions.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again Matthew. Just FYI: I don't think a lot of compactions are 
&gt; happening at level 5. See this for one vnode:
&gt; 
&gt; $ ls -l 0/sst\_5 | cut -c 32-35,39-43 | uniq
&gt; 
&gt; Feb 2012
&gt; Mar 2012
&gt; Apr 2012
&gt; May 2012
&gt; Jun 2012
&gt; Jul 2012
&gt; Aug 2012
&gt; Sep 2012
&gt; Oct 2012
&gt; 
&gt; And there is not a single file in a sst\_5 subdir with a 2013 date ($ ls -l 
&gt; \*/sst\_5 | grep " 2013 "). As a side note: the sst\_5 subdirectories themselves 
&gt; have a Apr 3 2013 date.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Timo
