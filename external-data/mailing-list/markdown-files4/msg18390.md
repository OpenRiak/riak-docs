Hi Stefan
On the one hand, even before the demise of Basho, they’d stopped supporting 
Riak CS. On the other, there is an organisation based in Japan, but with an 
international remote team, that supports other CS customers, so may well be a 
choice of support.

The CS code base has not had a huge amount of recent attention, but there are 
plenty of people running at, in industry, at reasonable scale.

There’s a genuine market of providers of ex-Basho products, and a community of 
CS users. However there are alternatives under active development.

Regards

Russell

&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm new to Riak-CS and just joined the group.
&gt; 
&gt; We've been exploring Riak-CS now for a couple of days and consider it as a 
&gt; potential inhouse-alternative to external S3-based storage providers.
&gt; 
&gt; Given the last commit was in January 2016, the question rose as to how well 
&gt; the project is supported and how mature the solution is.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be very thankful for any comments from the community on this.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards
&gt; Stefan
