Shazam!

There's also a StreamingListKeys operation that is somewhat less blocking that 
a straight up ListKeys.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I would like to get a list of all the keys in a particular bucket. I would

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; This is well-documented in our docs [0]. Please note that this is
&gt;&gt; \*not\* recommended for production use (as the page states). I took a
&gt;&gt; quick look at the CorrugatedIron docs [1] and didn't find any details
&gt;&gt; on how to do this which means that either a) I missed it or b) OJ and
&gt;&gt; Jeremiah saved you a lot of production pain by not implementing it. :)
