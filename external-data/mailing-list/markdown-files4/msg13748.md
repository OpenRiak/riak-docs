Hello,

I'm playing with the Bitcask storage backend and realized it will be nice
if there is a cache functionality realized with the Memory backend. If I
install both Bitcask and Memory storage backends as Mult Is there any easy
way, a simple script that could do the caching by simply installing it with
pre-commit hook?

Thanks in advance,
Ivaylo Panitchkov
