&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Newbie question. I am trying to find documentation about Riak security.
&gt; I have seen
&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/Network-Security-and-Firewall-Configurations.html,
&gt; but I could not find much on access control.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible to secure access to Riak nodes? Does it offer something
&gt; similar to http://srp.stanford.edu/ (i.e. remote login)?
&gt; 
&gt; I read somewhere that Riak does not use encryption for exchange between
&gt; nodes. Is this (still) correct? What about communication with users
&gt; applications?
&gt; 
&gt; If the answer to the above question is no, then how can one secure a
&gt; Riak system properly?
&gt; 

Put an apache (or whatever) server in front and proxy the requests accordingly 
and setup the security through the underlying web service. 


You -&gt; [ apache -&gt; riak ] (where [] is the box).

Or

You -&gt; apache -&gt; riak (where riak only allows requests from the apache server 
via the firewall on the riak server -- such as iptables)

The same problem exists in technologies like memcached.
