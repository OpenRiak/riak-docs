Hi Mark,
Itâ€™s an error that means there is no function clause in 
riak\_object:merge\_contents that matches the given arguments. It is hard to tell 
from the snippet of log you posted what the issue is here since the arguments 
are truncated. Is this related to you cluster restore from a backup? It looks 
like it is related to your periodic read timeouts. 

What version of Riak are you running, and what are the bucket properties for 
this object? Is there more information in the error log, any messages about 
hd([]) for example?

Can you grab the actual object in questions from each of the primary vnodes and 
in some console manually run the merge function and see what the results are? 
If you need help with how to do this let me know.

Cheers

Russell

&gt; Hello

&gt; I'm seeing the following error message for a number of objects:
&gt; 
&gt; console.log:2017-06-26 02:06:00.351 [error] &lt;0.12343.73&gt; gen\_fsm &lt;0.12343.73&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; {r\_object,{&lt;&lt;"commercial"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"precalculatedchar"&gt;&gt;},&lt;&lt;"00002065"&gt;&gt;,[{r\_content,{dict,7,16,16,8,...},...}],...},
&gt; &lt;&lt;"false"&gt;&gt;) line 306
&gt; 
&gt; What does "no function clause matching riak\_object:merge\_contents" mean?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
