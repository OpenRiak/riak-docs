Yes, we ended up doing that in the end. Was just a usecase where \_sometimes\_ 
the map was required as a whole, while \_other times\_ only a specific entry. I 
believe search would help with some of this, but we are still looking into that.

Thanks everyone for your help

Cheers

&gt; Hi Cosmin,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the dumb question, but if you are interested in a specific entry 
&gt; why not to store it as a separate key? It would be easier for updates, too.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I couldnâ€™t find this anywhere in the docs: is there a mechanism in Riak to 
&gt; fetch only one Register (or a specific entry) from a map?
&gt; We have a use case where we have a map and need to only get the value for a 
&gt; key in the map, rather than the whole map, and I would rather not transfer 
&gt; the entire thing on the client.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
