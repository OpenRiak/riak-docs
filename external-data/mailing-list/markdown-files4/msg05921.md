Mat,

Are you sure you're using milliseconds[1] to specify the timeout?

&gt; I'm running a map/reduce operation with fairly complex map and reduce

&gt; node. I've started consistently seeing this error during the reduce
&gt; phase:
&gt;
&gt; error:{case\_clause,{error,timeout}} reducing:
&gt; (then a dump of a bunch of the data for the phase)
&gt;
&gt; The map/reduce itself has a timeout of 10 minutes, but this is
&gt; happening after about 30 seconds. Any idea what could be causing this?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
