Hi Humberto,

Excuse the delay here - this question slipped through. Can you walk
through what you're trying to do?

When it comes to hook examples, the best examples are kept up-to-date
on this page [1]. I found one example from this blog post [2] which
you can jump to by searching the page for "% pre- and post-commit hook
functions."

&gt; Hello everyone!
&gt;
&gt; I am new using Riak 2.0. I am trying to put some hooks to my buckets but
&gt; every time that I add the path to my advanced.config file, and restart, it
&gt; doesn't work :(
&gt;
&gt; Any help? I am following the documentation of Basho but nothing.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone can send an example of the right configuration?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Humberto
