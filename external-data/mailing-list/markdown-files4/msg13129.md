A small portion of the data will be moved to the new node. Specifically
virtual nodes will be shuffled to assure even data distribution in the
cluster. This is in the docs at [1]

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I have read through many articles about riak but I am little confused how
&gt; does riak scale when adding a node. Assume I am having 5nodes having n\_val
&gt; of 3 with 8gb Ram and 100gb ebs for each node and they have reached the
&gt; capacity of ram and harddisk now I am planning to add one more node to the
&gt; cluster to scale but since the n\_val is 3 it will keep adding to old nodes
&gt; as well. My question is how does it scale does it move data from old nodes
&gt; to the new node rebalance and free up space from old node?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
