&gt;&gt; I just checked out the link (provided below) and did not find a
&gt;&gt; \*source\* distribution. Could you work that into the distribution?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, there should be one of those -- will ping Jared.

Thanks!

&gt;&gt; In my particular situation, I'm working on Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) and
&gt;&gt; Ubuntu 9.x. I can manage building if given a source distro, but would
&gt;&gt; certainly prefer pre-built packages (32-bit on both platforms).
&gt;
&gt; There is a i386 .deb which may work on ubuntu9; would be curious to
&gt; know if it does. :)

I'm away [on vacation] from my ubuntu systems right now, but will try
it late next week and provide feedback.

&gt;...
&gt;&gt; I had a one-line change for one of those pages last week, and sent
&gt;&gt; that to this mailing list (and it was promptly fixed; yay!). What is
&gt;&gt; the recommended "best" process for feedback? Should we all fork the
&gt;&gt; website, make changes, and send pull requests? Send mail here? File
&gt;
&gt; Pull requests are easiest from a procedural standpoint.

Will do.

Cheers,
