Ugh, sent it too fast, sorry. I also meant to add:

&gt;&gt; AFAIK, there are still quite a few remaining issues in Riak's code base that 
&gt;&gt; need to be resolved before the database itself can be compiled and run on 
&gt;&gt; OTP-19+

Is there a list of them somewhere so that the community can pitch in and help?

&gt;&gt; Any timeline for upgrading Riak to OTP 19? OTP 20 is expected in few weeks. 
&gt;&gt; It is holding us back niceties like improved maps etc. from the upgrade.

&gt;&gt; Hi Senthil,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; AFAIK, there are still quite a few remaining issues in Riak's code base that 
&gt;&gt; need to be resolved before the database itself can be compiled and run on 
&gt;&gt; OTP-19+.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a timeline for when they might be resolved? An idea as to when an 
&gt; OTP19 Riak might be released?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; However, IIRC the Riak Erlang Client can be compiled on OTP-19, and some 
&gt;&gt; preliminary testing I did last year suggests that it works OK. If you go 
&gt;&gt; down that route, please test your own build of the Riak Erlang Client 
&gt;&gt; carefully.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Magnus
