I've posted about this earlier, see 
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2013-September/013270.html

I would like to provide some more background information as I still see no 
decrease in storage space used at all so far. I currently have a 6 node cluster 
where I am using the multi-backend, the relevant part of app.config is below. 
Smaller K/V items are stored in the default backend on a small but fast disk 
(also leveldb), larger items ranging 1-6Mb per value are stored in a separate 
LevelDB backend that is mounted on a 2TB SATA drive (side note: I used the 
"filesystem" backend during development in the early Riak versions, hence the 
&lt;&lt;"fs"&gt;&gt; name). Using the bucket properties the backend is chosen and also for 
the large items the n\_val is set to 2. See the curl output below.

 %% Riak KV config
 {riak\_kv, [
 %% Storage\_backend specifies the Erlang module defining the storage
 %% mechanism that will be used on this node.

 {storage\_backend, riak\_kv\_multi\_backend},
 {multi\_backend\_default, &lt;&lt;"eleveldb"&gt;&gt;},
 {multi\_backend, [
 {&lt;&lt;"eleveldb"&gt;&gt;, riak\_kv\_eleveldb\_backend, [
 {data\_root, "/data/riak/leveldb"}
 ]},
 {&lt;&lt;"fs"&gt;&gt;, riak\_kv\_eleveldb\_backend, [
 {data\_root, "/bigdata/riak/bigleveldb"}
 ]}, 
 {&lt;&lt;"cache"&gt;&gt;, riak\_kv\_memory\_backend, [
 {max\_memory, 16}, %% 16Mb
 {ttl, 86400} %% 1 Day in seconds
 ]}
 ]},

# curl http://localhost:8098/riak/avis
{"props":{"allow\_mult":false,"backend":"fs","big\_vclock":50,"chash\_keyfun":{"mod":"riak\_core\_util","fun":"chash\_std\_keyfun"},"dw":"quorum","last\_write\_wins":false,"linkfun":{"mod":"riak\_kv\_wm\_link\_walker","fun":"mapreduce\_linkfun"},"n\_val":2,"name":"avis","old\_vclock":86400,"postcommit":[],"precommit":[],"r":1,"rw":"quorum","small\_vclock":10,"w":"quorum","young\_vclock":20}}

In the last two weeks I have deleted over 400,000 of large values (stored in 
/bigdata/riak/bigleveldb), placing only small meta-information in there (in 
Ruby: robject.raw\_data = '', robject.meta['info']='info'). So far I have seen 
absolutely no decrease in data usage at all. Since it is a production system 
new data is also coming in every day and I've deleted many months of older (&gt;1 
year) data in the last two weeks. I do see a few "Compacting" lines in the 
LevelDB log files (see logging below) but the storage usage is only going up.

I got some pointers from Matthew (from Basho) and Jens, however I'm still 
stuck. Maybe I should wait even longer but my disks are filling up so I'll have 
to expand the cluster or install larger 4TB drives in all the nodes (one by 
one, copying the data of course).

Can anyone, maybe especially Matthew, tell me if I need to be more patient or 
that there is something I can actively do about this situation?

Thanks,
Timo
