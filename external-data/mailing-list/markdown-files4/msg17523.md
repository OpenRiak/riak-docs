&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Are there any plans on releasing a Riak Java client with Netty-4.1.x?
&gt;
&gt; The reasoning for this is that some projects like Vert.x 3.3.0 for example
&gt; are already on Netty-4.1.x and AFAIK Netty's 4.1.x isn't just a drop in
&gt; replacement for 4.0.x
&gt;
&gt; Would it make sense to support another Riak Java client, say version 2.1.x
&gt; with Netty-4.1.x as a way to move forward?
&gt;
&gt; Or maybe Riak 2.0.x works with Netty 4.1.x? but I doubt it.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
&gt;
&gt; Guido.
