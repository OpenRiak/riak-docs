I've been carrying this evented datastore torch for a while now and been making 
pretty good progress in that direction. This evening I pushed a Riak postcommit 
hook to my github that sends updated entries to RabbitMQ using the Erlang AMQP 
client.

This is the other half of the equation for the custom exchange type I wrote to 
push RabbitMQ messages into Riak.

This gets me one step closer to that evented datastore Nirvana I doubt is 
actually possible--but you gotta have a dream, right? :)

Thanks!
