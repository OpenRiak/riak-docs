It seems to move between 4 keys in particular, these keys are actually
empty at the moment (i.e. an empty JSON document).

CPU utilization is close to zero.

Can't see anything in particular, bar the error message I just posted
before.

&gt; Hi Jason,
&gt;
&gt; Are these random timeouts happening for only one key, or is common for
&gt; more?
&gt;
&gt; What is the CPU utilisation in the cluster when you're experience these
&gt; timeouts?
&gt;
&gt; Can you spot anything peculiar in your server's $ dmesg outputs? Any I/O
&gt; errors there?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Ciprian

&gt;&gt; Several things:
&gt;&gt; 1) I recommend you have a 5-node cluster:
&gt;&gt; http://basho.com/why-your-riak-cluster-should-have-at-least-five-nodes/
&gt;&gt; 2) What version of Riak are you using?
&gt;&gt; 3) What backend(s) are you using?
&gt;&gt; 4) What's the size of your keyspace?
&gt;&gt; 5) Are you actively rewriting keys, or writing keys to the cluster?
&gt;&gt; 6) Do you know how much I/O the cluster is currently doing?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; We are getting random timeouts from our application (&gt;60seconds) when
&gt;&gt; we try
&gt;&gt; &gt; to retrieve a key from our Riak cluster (4 nodes with a load balancer in
&gt;&gt; &gt; front of them). Our application just uses the standard REST API to query
&gt;&gt; &gt; Riak.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; We are pretty new to Riak - so would like to understand how best to
&gt;&gt; debug
&gt;&gt; &gt; this issue? Is there any good pointers on what to start with? This is
&gt;&gt; our
&gt;&gt; &gt; production cluster.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; &gt; Jason
