Mikhail,

that certainly sounds possible, but would extend the run time of your test 
suite quite considerably, e.g. when you start a fresh set of virtualized 
instances on every run.

An alternative would be to always leave a Riak cluster running for testing 
purposes and reset it after or before every complete test run, i.e. stop the 
Riak processes, wipe the data, and start them up again.

Ripple (Ruby client for Riak) and riak-js (Node.js client) both include a test 
server that runs a Riak instance with an in-memory backend, maybe that would be 
an alternative to go with?

&gt; Could anyone [please! :)] comment on feasibility/possibility of such a
