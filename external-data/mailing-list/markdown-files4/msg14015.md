&gt; We have a Riak/Riak CS cluster and want to calculate S3 storage statistics

That's correct.

&gt; We distribute configs to our nodes from a common template. Would it be ok to 
&gt; add same {storage\_schedule, [...]} on all nodes or only one node should 
&gt; initiate storage recalculation at a tim

You should only add this to one node. There may be different ways to do this, 
depending on what configuration management tool you're using.
