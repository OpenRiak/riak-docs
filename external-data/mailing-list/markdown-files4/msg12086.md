Created buckets in Riak or Riak CS? For what it's worth, we don't recommend 
using the same cluster for both Riak and Riak CS.

&gt; The list buckets command returns
&gt; three of them, and I've manually set allow\_mult on all of them and confirmed
&gt; that the change stuck, but riak-cs still displays the same error. 

Can you gist/pastebin your Riak app.config? Make sure you're adding the default 
bucket properties to the `riak\_core` section of the app.config. As well as the 
result of:

curl localhost:8098/riak/random-bucket

For me, it looks like [1] (note the "allow\_mult": true line).
