Riak 1.4 upgrade reorganizes levels one and two upon upgrade. This likely 
pushed data up into your level 5. 

No, there currently is no control on compaction I/O.

&gt; I have upgraded two nodes in my cluster from 1.3.2 to 1.4.2. After the 
&gt; upgrade it appears both started a compaction, as mentioned here: 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.4/RELEASE-NOTES.md#leveldb-13-to-14-conversion.
&gt; In my case I think this may have also triggered compactions at level 5 
&gt; (finally) - see this earlier thread about stale data not getting removed: 
&gt; http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2013-September/013392.html.
&gt; Which is good as the 2TB drive dedicated for this data was almost filled 
&gt; completely. After the compaction finished, some 12-16 hours later, about 
&gt; 200Gb of data was removed.
&gt; 
&gt; Two questions remain:
&gt; 1) can someone please confirm that indeed the upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4 
&gt; triggered the compactions, all the way to the level 5 compactions?
&gt; 2) is there some way to limit the I/O for the compactions?
&gt; 
&gt; The problem was that during the compaction the node was really slow to 
&gt; respond (I took it out of the HAProxy config), the CPU load was no problem, 
&gt; around 30% on a single core only, however the iowait was high. Using iostat I 
&gt; noticed the disk continuously reading AND writing around 30Mb/s (normal, 
&gt; spinning disk, SATA).
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt; Timo
