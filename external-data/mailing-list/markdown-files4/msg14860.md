Or could it be that the timeout is also used inside the automatic 2i
AAE? Now I try to repair all partitions.. but this will take some time
(2-4hours per partition with 256 partitions overall and probably only
3-4 partitions in parallel.. so ~10 days minimum).

But still the question, why was it not self healing?

Cheers
Simon
