Hi,

My initial understanding of the riak\_host variable in the Stanchion config
was that it needed to point at a proxy that load balances to the different
riak nodes. I think now I'm under the impression that it just needs to
point to a node in the riak cluster and that should be sufficient.

The docs here didn't clarify it for me:
http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/configuration/Configuring-Stanchion/

Thanks again for your help,
Ben
