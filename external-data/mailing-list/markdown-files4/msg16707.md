Hey,

I need a secondary index with my counter, but I found an information that
​"​
Counters have no support for Secondary Indexes (2i), Links or Custom HTTP
Metadata
​" (http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/references/http/counters/).

​What if I treat a counter as an object, and use riakc\_pb\_socket:get/3 and
riakc\_pb\_socket:put/2 to set a secondary index? Example:
https://gist.github.com/loucash/8ffe463833052ca779b1

What are the implications of a hack like that?
Will i get away with that?

Kind Regards,
Lukasz Biedrycki
