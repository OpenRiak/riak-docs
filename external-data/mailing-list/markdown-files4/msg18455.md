Martin,
I fully agree. We started the Kyorai org log before it was public knowledge 
that bet365 (or anyone) would buy the IP of basho and done under the assumption 
that the basho repository would either be deleted or end up rotting there. The 
goal was/is to prevent fragmentation and give the community still using the 
repos a home where they can come together.

That said I think it’ll take some time getting everything back together. The 
repos there are currently the mirrors of what is on hex, and due to how hard it 
was to get changes merged to the basho repositories have all diverged to some 
degree or another. So there is work to be done to get it all back in sync. I 
can’t speak for the other people who maintain repos on Kyorai (so I suspect 
they feel the same) but I’d be eager to get it all back together and kill of 
forks.

Cheers,
Heinz

&gt; Hello
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst bet365 did buy the Basho IP, they have emphasised that the entire 
&gt; catalogue of repositories is to be handed over to the community and that they 
&gt; are not intending to be an overarching authority on decision making, but will 
&gt; steer the project just as much as any other involved parties would. So, from 
&gt; my perspective, it is not a decision for bet365 to take, but for the 
&gt; community as a whole.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I don't see a lot of merit in moving the repo away from its 
&gt; current home at this point in time. Once the legal processes have concluded 
&gt; and people have the facility to manage the repository configurations, anyone 
&gt; interested in contributing and maintaining can be added - enabling the 
&gt; RabbitMQ team to work on Cuttlefish without the upheaval of moving 
&gt; repositories around. When the dust has settled, then revisit the question of 
&gt; spinning the project out into its own org.
&gt; 
&gt; What's everyone else's thoughts on this?

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Luke,
&gt; The Kyorai org is a collection of (ex)basho projects that have been forked 
&gt; and maintained outside of basho for a while now. While it was a bit of a 
&gt; scattered effort in the beginning the demise of basho ended up causing us to 
&gt; collect them in a central place.
&gt; 
&gt; How things go forward really depends a bit on how things go forward with riak 
&gt; and the basho PI, and the community around it.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Heinz

&gt;&gt; Hi again everyone -
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Apologies for not setting a subject in my first email.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Of course this is Bet365's decision. The purpose of this message
&gt;&gt; thread is to let people know that the RabbitMQ team is willing to
&gt;&gt; maintain cuttlefish. I also found the following more-up-to-date fork
&gt;&gt; and will be looking at the changes there -

&gt;&gt; Thanks again!

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s for bet365 to make that decision.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; For the good of the general population the following would be nice:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; a) Upgrade to rebar3
&gt;&gt;&gt; b) Upgrade Erlang version support so it compiles under Erlang 20 (if it 
&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn’t already)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c) Package uploaded to hex.pm
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Riak users -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The next RabbitMQ release (3.7.0) will use cuttlefish for its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; configuration. I'm writing to express interest on behalf of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RabbitMQ team in taking over maintenance of the project. At the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; moment, we forked cuttlefish to the RabbitMQ organization [0] to fix a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; couple pressing issues. After that, it would be great if the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; repository could be transferred to either its own, new organization or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the RabbitMQ organization entirely. Basho transferred both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Webmachine and Lager to their own independent organizations, for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; instance (github.com/webmachine, github.com/erlang-lager)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once transferred, GitHub will take care of all the necessary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; redirections from the Basho organization to cuttlefish's new home.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Luke Bakken
