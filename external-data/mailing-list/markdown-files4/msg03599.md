Gordon,

Thanks for the test case. I've queued it up for review by a dev, as
time permits.

&gt; Guys I have put together a simple test to reproduce the error that we are
&gt; seeing.
&gt; It is on github here:
&gt; https://github.com/gordyt/riaksearch-test
&gt; This is a multi-threaded test that connects to Riak using the protocol
&gt; buffers interface.  Each iteration of the run loop issues one simple search
&gt; and uploads one small json object.
&gt; Thanks very much for any input you might have.

&gt; Good Morning Gilbert,
&gt; I have posted this gist:
&gt; https://gist.github.com/1010384
&gt; It is a minor update we made to it\_op\_collector\_loop/3 in
&gt; riak\_search\_op\_utils.  This update was done to alleviate the situation that
&gt; we observe here:
&gt; https://gist.github.com/1000735
&gt; But it was made with the understanding that this is treating a symptom and
&gt; not fixing the cause of the problem.
&gt; A little bit of followup information: The problem seems to be exacerbated
&gt; when Riak is hit with a series of operations that are all generating the
&gt; same search/map/reduce operation (albeit with differing search input
&gt; parameters).
&gt; We installed 0.14.2 and tested this weekend (without our update applied) and
&gt; observed the same issues.
&gt; If I found out anything else I will let you know.

&gt; Hey we are testing a fix now.  If this works I will send you a copy of the

&gt; Hi Gordon,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for sharing the information.  We are seeing the same exact
&gt;
&gt; type of behavior from our search cluster.  I have tracked the
&gt;
&gt; problem(s) though the query system.  It looks like the mailboxes we
&gt;
&gt; are both seeing are "abandoned" and / or the messages are never
&gt;
&gt; matched within the Erlang code (it\_op\_collector\_loop,
&gt;
&gt; riak\_search\_op\_utils.erl); the messages are then never processed,
&gt;
&gt; therefore the resources they utilize never released.  This is a major
&gt;
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; I have been debugging this for some time and I wish I could say it was
&gt;
&gt; going well.  The implementation is convoluted -- have you gotten
&gt;
&gt; through it?  Can you verify the same cause?
&gt;
&gt; We have been internally discussing the possibility of removing this
&gt;
&gt; query processing implementation completely and replacing it with
&gt;
&gt; something built in-house because the problems we have uncovered trying
&gt;
&gt; to debug the "abandoned mailbox" problem are related and systemic:  1)
&gt;
&gt; indeterminate and possibly very large data structures created and
&gt;
&gt; manipulated for intermediate and final sets of results, 2) very poor
&gt;
&gt; or non-existent ability to gain any insight into what is executing
&gt;
&gt; within the "plumbing" of the current query execution system without
&gt;
&gt; "herculean" effort (in my opinion), and 3) unacceptable performance
&gt;
&gt; (predictably or subjectively) from the merge\_index riak\_search
&gt;
&gt; backend.
&gt;
&gt; Are there any other backends available for riak\_search with the
&gt;
&gt; Enterprise Riak offering?  I really like the design of riak\_search but
&gt;
&gt; the performance seems to be only a very small fraction of our
&gt;
&gt; equivalent SOLR installation, even with several times the amount of
&gt;
&gt; resources "thrown at it" -- it does not seem to use resources we
&gt;
&gt; "throw at it" well, either, or in the mailboxes case, responsibly.
&gt;
&gt; I will quickly admit I may be doing something wrong.  Is there a
&gt;
&gt; user-error situation in which mailboxes should be abandoned taking up
&gt;
&gt; memory?
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone else have experiences with equivalent riak\_search vs. SOLR
&gt;
&gt; installations?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again for sharing Gordon.  Your results make me feel like this
&gt;
&gt; may not be entirely stupidity on my part.

&gt; Howdy Gilbert,
&gt;
&gt; I reproduced the issue this morning and then ran the command that you
&gt;
&gt; specified on two of the non-empty mailboxes.
&gt;
&gt; The output from that is posted here:
&gt;
&gt; https://gist.github.com/1000735
&gt;
&gt; Please let me know if this corresponds to the issue that you are seeing.

&gt; Could you try:
&gt;
&gt; erlang:process\_info(list\_to\_pid("&lt;0.16614.32&gt;"), [messages,
&gt;
&gt; current\_function, initial\_call, links, memory, status]).
&gt;
&gt; in a riak search console for one/some of those mailboxes and share the
&gt;
&gt; results? I am curious to see if you are having the same systemic
&gt;
&gt; memory consumption I am experiencing.

&gt; Howdy Gang,
&gt;
&gt; We are having a bit of an issue with our 3-node riaksearch cluster.  What is
&gt;
&gt; happing is this:
&gt;
&gt; Cluster is up and running.  We start testing our application against it.  As
&gt;
&gt; the application runs the erlang process consumes more and more memory
&gt;
&gt; without ever releasing it.
&gt;
&gt; In trying to investigate the issue we ran the riaksearch-admin cluster\_info
&gt;
&gt; command.  It appears that the bulk of this memory is being consumed by a
&gt;
&gt; bunch of mailboxes.
&gt;
&gt; I have posted both the output of the cluster\_info command and the app.config
&gt;
&gt; from one of the nodes here:
&gt;
&gt; https://gist.github.com/996419
&gt;
&gt; I would be very grateful if someone from Basho would take a look at the
&gt;
&gt; cluster\_info and see if they can spot anything obvious.
&gt;
&gt; Each machine in the cluster has an 8-core Xeon and 16GB RAM.  I believe all
&gt;
&gt; of the platform details, etc., are in the cluster\_info dump.
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks,
&gt;
