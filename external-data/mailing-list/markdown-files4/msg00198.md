Hi Dave and wde,

Thanks for ur explanation, it helps me to decide which storage backend
should I use. Appreciate that.

Regards,
Abe

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Data example : [{field, "value"}, {field, "value"}, {field, "value"}]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; First observation -- that's only ~61 bytes of data when encoded into
&gt; binary -- which is pretty small. If you start storing larger chunks of data
&gt; (say 10k), you'll find that dets starts running into significant iowait
&gt; issues as it tries to flush the data to disk.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I found out that storing 200k of data sequentially into dets is a lot more
&gt;&gt; faster than storing into innodb and dets only use around 350MB space while
&gt;&gt; innodb use around 1.1GB.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, inno does introduce expansion, particularly when you are using very
&gt; small piece of data. I believe this has something to do with the way that
&gt; Inno allocates a 8 KB page per BLOB.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, in my other test which store 1 million data into dets, it only use
&gt;&gt; around 700MB++ of space (same data structure above).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is recommended to use innostore for production right?What should I do
&gt;&gt; to make it better.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Whether or not you should use innostore vs. dets in production depends
&gt; heavily on what your access pattern is and how much data you plan to store.
&gt; If you've going to be storing many gigabytes of data, innostore will do much
&gt; better than dets as the dataset grows large. Innostore has better durability
&gt; mechanisms that dets as well, so that's something to consider too.
&gt;
&gt; Dets is very fast in situations where you have a small-ish amount of data
&gt; and reads predominate your access pattern.
&gt;
&gt; Hope that helps.
&gt;
&gt; D.
