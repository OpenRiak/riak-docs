Alin,

Lager is flexible like that. If you notice the error counts incrementing
then you can do something like the following at the Riak console.

{ok, Trace} = lager:trace\_file("/failing-postcommits", [{module,
riak\_kv\_put\_fsm}, {function, decode\_postcommit}], debug).

That should send any debug msgs originating from that module + function to
the /failing-postcommits file. To stop the trace run the following:

lager:stop\_trace(Trace).

&gt; Ok, that makes sense; but, what if another approach is picked up, like
&gt; being able to tune this specific logging separately ? Or have the lager
&gt; being able to log messages on different files per module/function - that
&gt; way the logging flood would be isolated only to this...
&gt; Sorry for being so insistent regarding this matter, but it seems that post
&gt; commits are a pretty neat feature which we're not able to use because of
&gt; this exception/error handling inconvenient.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt;&gt; I would say that having those informations into the log files,
&gt; especially
&gt; &gt;&gt; the reason why it failed, is very useful, so, would you say it would be
&gt; &gt;&gt; helpful if I'm going to open a pull request which will increase the log
&gt; &gt;&gt; level usage from debug to error for pre/post commit hooks execution
&gt; errors
&gt; &gt;&gt; (as it seems to be pretty straight forward) ?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; The reason we put it at the debug level is to avoid logging flood when
&gt; &gt; you break a postcommit hook in production and all your postcommits start
&gt; &gt; to fail. If you're doing thousands of writes per second, that would
&gt; &gt; obviously be bad.
