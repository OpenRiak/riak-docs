Hi Paul,

Deleting a key in Riak will result it being removed from the Yokozuna/Solr
index.

Call the delete method against a bucket object and pass in the name of the
key as an argument, such as:

pauls\_bucket = client.bucket('foo')
pauls\_bucket.delete('bar')

You can also call delete against a riak object if you've previously fetched
it.

Tom

&gt; Can anyone advise?
