Thanks Russell, that’s good to know

As for search - we haven’t investigated that avenue as we’re not using the 
search capabilities yet, but it might be in the future.

Cheers

&gt; Not yet. I think that would be cool too.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now, a map is just a riak object.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess with Riak Search indexing though, you could get something similar, 
&gt; maybe?

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I couldn’t find this anywhere in the docs: is there a mechanism in Riak to 
&gt;&gt; fetch only one Register (or a specific entry) from a map?
&gt;&gt; We have a use case where we have a map and need to only get the value for a 
&gt;&gt; key in the map, rather than the whole map, and I would rather not transfer 
&gt;&gt; the entire thing on the client.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Cheers
