Are you rewriting keys? What client library are you using to upload them?

Just as an aside, you should probably use Riak-CS, Vanilla Riak isn't
really meant to handle object storage.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I've read several threads about this question but I haven't found a clear
&gt; answer yet, so here it is :
&gt;
&gt; I'm working on a POC to store images in riak. In my test I've uploaded ~50K
&gt; images so far. In NTFS they take ~1GB of disk space but riak goes up to
&gt; 70GB!
&gt;
&gt; If I use the standard disk space calculation, storage space in riak should
&gt; be 1GB x 3 (n\_val) = 3GB so there is a 25 factor I can't understand.
&gt;
&gt; My riak is a vanilla v2.0.0 on a Debian 3.2.51 with the default dev conf (1
&gt; cluster, 5 nodes on a single box, n\_val=3) and bitcask storage.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Simon
