Hello Jason,

I initially was thinking that you’re issues were similar to what we’ve found 
here, https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/issues/442#issuecomment-77233636 
, but 
seeing {error, retry\_later} and the 500s seem to place the problems more on the 
Solr end. Just to make sure, are you seeing `yz\_events` crashes in your logs?

Can you tell me how much RAM each node has and have you adjusted/increased the 
search.sol.jmv\_options max heap size at all (more info on issues/factors w/ 
Solr performance here -&gt; 
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/configs/search/#Solr-for-Operators
 
)?
 

What kind of issues are you getting in your solr logs? Anything related to 
bad/corrupted data (which will index into \_yz\_err fields when dealing with 
failed extractions) or possible sibling explosion (duplicates of the same 
object with different \_yz\_vtag fields)? 

Thanks.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; We're having real trouble with Riak Search.
&gt; We are seeing an awful lot of errors, which leads to alot of logging for solr 
&gt; and the disk IO reaching 95% + which is causing lots of issues.
&gt; 
&gt; - We consistently see errors around Riak trying to create indexes which 
&gt; already exist - only a restart of each Riak node stops this for a period of 
&gt; time - indexes are only ever created manually, not by software.
&gt; 
&gt; - We see lots of errors around failing to index objects - details of what 
&gt; appears in the log are:
&gt; 
&gt; 2015-03-07 10:30:26.871 [error] &lt;0.2538.0&gt;@yz\_kv:index:215 failed to index 
&gt; object 
&gt; {{&lt;&lt;"Production"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;"Grains.Domain.Case"&gt;&gt;},&lt;&lt;"455203890918dfc6fd3c7da49dd6adb00300000043a46a51"&gt;&gt;}
&gt; with error {"Failed to index docs",{error,retry\_later}} because 
&gt; [{yz\_solr,index,3,[{file,"src/yz\_solr.erl"},{line,192}]},{yz\_kv,index,7,[{file,"src/yz\_kv.erl"},{line,267}]},{yz\_kv,index,3,[{file,"src/yz\_kv.erl"},{line,202}]},{riak\_kv\_vnode,actual\_put,6,[{file,"src/riak\_kv\_vnode.erl"},{line,1418}]},{riak\_kv\_vnode,perform\_put,3,[{file,"src/riak\_kv\_vnode.erl"},{line,1406}]},{riak\_kv\_vnode,do\_put,7,[{file,"src/riak\_kv\_vnode.erl"},{line,1201}]},{riak\_kv\_vnode,handle\_command,3,[{file,"src/riak\_kv\_vnode.erl"},{line,486}]},{riak\_core\_vnode,vnode\_command,3,[{file,"src/riak\_core\_vnode.erl"},{line,345}]}]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - We are also starting to see 500's being returned for search queries - the 
&gt; response looks like this:
