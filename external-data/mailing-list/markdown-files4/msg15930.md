Hi John,

I believe I saw this conversation over IRC. Sean responded saying "those
measure at different layers, seems reasonable to me. I mean, your 100% is
bad... but those numbers seem to make sense to me."

Did you end up finding the clarity you need here? It'd be helpful to hear
the details.

&gt; Quick question...
&gt;
&gt; Is it safe to assume these two metrics endpoint are expected to display
&gt; the same stats.
&gt;
&gt; watch -n 1 riak-admin stat show \*\*get\_fsm\_time\*\*
&gt;
&gt; shows 0's for node\_get\_fsm\_time\_99/95 (occasionally will see stats build
&gt; up for them, but then vanish back to 0).
&gt;
&gt; The stats interface via :8098/stats seems to be more reliable, in that I
&gt; never see 0 entries..
&gt;
&gt; This running riak 2.0.5, although I'm pretty sure I recall seeing this on
&gt; previous deployments.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
