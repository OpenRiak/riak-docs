Ah - thanks - I hadn't realised that I could pass :type to the robject delete 
method.

I'm finding the ruby client (latest sources cloned from Github) to be quite 
reliable - I have an app which is using most if not all the features, although 
not under any kind of load (I'm actually interested in Riak for its flexibility 
rather than for its resilience, which I realise may be a bit perverse). So far, 
I'm really liking 2.0 :-)

Thanks,

Paul

&gt; However, the only available delete method I can find is via the bucket. This 
&gt; method does not take a bucket-type parameter, so a call to the bucket to 
&gt; delete a given key is actually operating in the wrong namespace - the default 
&gt; one, rather than the bucket-typed one.
&gt; 
&gt; CRDT deletion is handled through the RObject:
&gt; 
&gt; bucket = client.bucket 'maps'
&gt; robject = bucket.get 'my\_crdt\_name'
&gt; robject.delete type: 'maps'
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that the Ruby client interface for bucket types needs some work: it's 
&gt; functional right now, but not great. Once the push for 2.0 is done, I'd like 
&gt; to make it a bit more monadic \*dodges thrown burrito\*.
