&gt; Hello,

&gt; I'm running a cluster of 4 nodes (1,8 TB on each) and I have a problem of
&gt; balancing. Current data repartition is 18%, 19%, 30%, 34%. The node with 34%
&gt; of cluster data is completely full and doesn't want to start anymoe.
&gt; I don't know what to do. Do you have a solution for such a problem?

It looks like you need to increase storage capacity for the entire
cluster so you can move some data off of the full node. Do you have
the ability to another machine (or two) to the cluster?

The issue, of course, is that you'll need to get that Riak node
running before it can hand off a subset of its data to a new member. I
assume the disk being full is the primary reason its failing to start?

&gt; Thank you in advance!
