I am new working with Riak, so it might be a simple oversight, but working
with Riak 2.0.5 I had no problems with Riak starting, when "search = on",
when Riak was fully installed. But recently attempting to work with Riak
2.1.1, following all the same instructions as 2.0.5, when I attempt to start
a node with "search = on" in the riak.conf the node times out and fails to
start. My crash.log reports

I am wondering if there is something I have configured wrong. If someone
knows what is wrong or thinks they could solve it but requires more
information I would love help.
