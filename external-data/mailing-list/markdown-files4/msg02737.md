&gt; I understand the desire to have a better name for what you're storing in Riak 
&gt; (I went down that road myself in the Ruby client for a while), but for 
&gt; consistency's sake it makes most sense to use "object" over "entry" or "doc". 
&gt; Using something else just invites confusion when someone reads the wiki and 
&gt; other documentation and then tries to apply what they learned to a specific 
&gt; language driver.

Oh yeah. I had not even considered that. A strong enough reason to settle it 
(for me at least.)

&gt; That said, there's no reason you can't build abstractions over the top of the 
&gt; object that are documents, entries, blobs, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; "RObject" is the class name the Ruby client uses, for what it's worth.
