Hi Jeremiah,

Yes. I very much want the ability to update the schema in 2.0. More
fundamental things have leap frogged it. Technically you can modify a
schema today but it has to be done by hand and is error prone.

&gt; I notice that YZ issue 130 (support for schema updates) was created 5
&gt; months ago and doesn't have any commits against it right now. Is this still
&gt; on track to get pushed into the product as part of Riak 2.0 or has no work
&gt; begun?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
