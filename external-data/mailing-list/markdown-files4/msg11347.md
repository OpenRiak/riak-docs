Riak 1.4 is targeted against the R15 series. We have a few branches that
make it work with R16, but had some performance issues we didn't have time
to investigate and resolve before the release.

We are planning to investigate moving to R16 for our next major release.

&gt; I'm just a bit curiosity about new riak1.4, after get rid of several
&gt; crypto-3.0 compatible problems, it failed when build riak\_kv, so it looks
&gt; like that 1.4 still can not build on R16B01, will it work with R16 in the
&gt; future? any clue about it?
