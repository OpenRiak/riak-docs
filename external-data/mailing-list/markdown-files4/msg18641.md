Hey Bryan,

Something similar in the RabbitMQ code base made me go "huh" the other
day. Calls to rabbit\_log\_ldap module functions when no such module
exists. Turns out there's a parse transform defined that turns these
calls into lager function calls to an extra sink:

https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common/blob/master/mk/rabbitmq-build.mk#L46

I couldn't find any instance of object\_lager\_event:info (debug,
warning, etc) function calls in the Riak code I have lying around,
though, so /shrug

Good luck -
Luke

&gt; I see this code all over the place (including snippets I provided in the

&gt;
&gt; However, a search on github (basho org/erlang-lager/lager) don’t throw up any

&gt;
&gt; (GitHub indexing doesn’t work well as GitHub only index master and basho 
&gt; stuff is a mess branch wise).
&gt;
&gt; Anyone got any idea ?

&gt; {formatter\_config, [date, " ", time," [",severity,"] 
&gt; ",message, "\n"]}
&gt; ]
&gt; }]
&gt; },
&gt; {async\_threshold, 500},
&gt; {async\_threshold\_window, 50}]
&gt; }
