You asked what difference the tm made. The tm invokes clause 6. So yes it
means moving forward means a new name. That's one of the things to be
considered.

&gt; &gt; No, but I can read.
&gt;
&gt; I read it too. I’m not sure what your point is. A day may come when the
&gt; name has to change?

&gt; &gt; &gt; So At minimum I read that as there would need to be a new product
&gt; name, and the docs for that product could say formerly known as Riak.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You are lawyer?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Looks like Basho has the trademark on Riak.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; They sure do. And if you look at the Apache2 license you’ll see that
&gt; it grants use of the name to identify the source.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Look, I’m not a lawyer, and I’m guessing you’re not a lawyer. What
&gt; difference does the name or trademark make? There are a bunch of active
&gt; users of Riak, some of whom have made it clear they plan to continue using
&gt; it. Dance on Basho’s grave all you want, but Riak isn’t dead yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean “encumbered”? Riak is the name of an Apache2
&gt; licensed open source database, so it can continue to be used to describe
&gt; that apache 2 licensed database, please don’t spread FUD.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You willing to invest time in a project that could be legally
&gt; encumbered at some point in the future because lawyers? You willing to put
&gt; that beyond the clown fiesta that is Basho? I don't think so.
