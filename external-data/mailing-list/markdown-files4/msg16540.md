Hi Muntasir,

I would probably submit a detailed pull request to Riak KV with the
changes, and a proper way to verify they work correctly.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt; Hi Chris,
&gt;
&gt; We made changes to Riak KV repository to add a control knob. The adaptive 
&gt; control mechanism is a separate middleware layer which uses the control knob 
&gt; we added to Riak KV. In addition to that we wrote a Riak YCSB connector, 
&gt; which is also not part of the Riak code base.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Muntasir.

&gt; Hi Muntasir,
&gt;
&gt; What repositories did you modify to provide this functionality? Does it 
&gt; exist purely as a middleware layer, or was any work done on Riak Core or KV?

&gt;&gt; Hi,

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am a PhD student working on distributed key-value storage systems
&gt;&gt; like Riak. Recently we have built an adaptive middleware framework
&gt;&gt; which can continuously tune kv store configurations (e.g., via
&gt;&gt; existing tuning knobs, and newly added/proposed knobs) to meet
&gt;&gt; consistency/availability service level agreements under changing
&gt;&gt; network conditions. We have deployed our system on top of Riak via a
&gt;&gt; small amount of code change in Riak (which could be submitted as a
&gt;&gt; patch), so that kv store developers can automatically tune the system
&gt;&gt; to meet SLAs. Now we are interested to contribute to the Riak community by 
&gt;&gt; adding our code to the Riak code base via a patch.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can anyone kindly suggest how to go about this? Any suggestions would
&gt;&gt; be highly appreciated.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Muntasir.
