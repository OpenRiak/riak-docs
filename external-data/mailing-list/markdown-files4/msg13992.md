&gt; Before you go down the path of changing proxies, could you provide logs from
&gt; one instance of your proxy server? They may provide more insight into what's
&gt; going on here. In addition, the config and logs from one Riak CS node would
&gt; be helpful - the command I gave earlier didn't have the final arguments:
&gt;
&gt; tar -czf /tmp/riak-cs-$(hostname).tgz /etc/riak-cs /var/log/riak-cs
