Demetri,

Thanks, I added a Github issue for this change, and one of us will take a look 
at all the app.config files to make sure there is parity across all packages.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I attended the Riak Workgroup yesterday in San Francisco. First off, thanks 
&gt; to Basho for hosting the discussion. My colleague and I both found it 
&gt; immensely useful.
&gt; 
&gt; Part of the discussion around partition size was about chosing a good 
&gt; ring\_creation\_size. We learned that 64 is the default, and also that the 
&gt; default setting is "probably too small for production." I quickly logged 
&gt; into my riak nodes to check our setting and was disappointed to see that the 
&gt; default setting is a "silent" default meaning the variable ring\_creation\_size 
&gt; does not appear in the app.config file at all. We've installed the 
&gt; riak-1.1.2-1.el6.x86\_64 RPM under CentOS6.
&gt; 
&gt; Can the maintainers of this RPM please make sure to include the 
&gt; ring\_creation\_size in the config?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
