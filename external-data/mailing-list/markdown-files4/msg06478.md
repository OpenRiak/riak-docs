Hi,
I am working on setting up a riak cluster as a KV storage for ~150Million 
documents with average document size being 4K. We started using 6 nodes (each 
node: 32GB, 8 quad cores) in a cluster with partition size of 256 (planning to 
take it down to 64 as next experiment). While the lookup is fast enough, 
\*\*bulk\*\* updating/loading the documents in this cluster with 6 clients and 100 
connections each is quite slow (takes hours to update ~30Million docs). Is 
there a better cluster configuration that we should try to speed up the process?

Thanks,
~Sarang
