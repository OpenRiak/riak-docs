&gt;
&gt; If you use Nginx to loadbalance to Riak CS, be sure that you set this in
&gt; your site configuration:
&gt;
&gt; proxy\_set\_header Host $http\_host;
&gt;
&gt; This ensures that the HTTP Host: header is passed through as it is
&gt; received, rather than replaced by the IP address or hostname of the
&gt; back-end server that nginx proxied the request to.
&gt;
&gt; Also ensure that the domain name fully matches the one in
&gt; /etc/riak-cs/app.config, and that you have wildcard DNS records configured
&gt; against it.
