Sorry if it wasn't clear, all the changes are in the transport branch:

https://github.com/gaiaops/riak-php-client/tree/transport

It can be merged into master once we are sure it is production ready.

Subject: php 5.3 protocol buffer client

Past few days I have been experimenting with a protocol buffers client for riak 
in php 5.3. 

https://github.com/gaiaops/riak-php-client
https://github.com/basho/riak-php-client/pull/20


It is a port of the existing php client and should be backward compatible with 
the existing code. Everything seems to work as expected and passes the unit 
tests.

Anyone willing to play with it in their test environments to help me find bugs? 
Also, interested in getting help finishing it, as maintaining the code is a lot 
of work.


~ John
