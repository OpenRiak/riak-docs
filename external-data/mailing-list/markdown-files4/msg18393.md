I never had the time to implement CS but my idea was using it as a
photo/video storage for the social network I was building on Raik-KV. But
seeing Basho's situation is better to look for a CS alternative.

LeoFS looks good, and seems Rakuten is one of its sponsors... might well
test it.

Thanks,
Alex

&gt;
&gt; There must be others.
&gt;
&gt; Or stay on CS. What do you need to stay on it? Basho were certainly not
&gt; doing anything.

&gt; please list them? I'm also interested on a CS alternative.

&gt; &gt; Hi Stefan
&gt; &gt; On the one hand, even before the demise of Basho, they’d stopped
&gt; supporting Riak CS. On the other, there is an organisation based in Japan,
&gt; but with an international remote team, that supports other CS customers, so
&gt; may well be a choice of support.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The CS code base has not had a huge amount of recent attention, but
&gt; there are plenty of people running at, in industry, at reasonable scale.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There’s a genuine market of providers of ex-Basho products, and a
&gt; community of CS users. However there are alternatives under active
&gt; development.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everybody,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm new to Riak-CS and just joined the group.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; We've been exploring Riak-CS now for a couple of days and consider it
&gt; as a potential inhouse-alternative to external S3-based storage providers.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Given the last commit was in January 2016, the question rose as to how
&gt; well the project is supported and how mature the solution is.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd be very thankful for any comments from the community on this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stefan
