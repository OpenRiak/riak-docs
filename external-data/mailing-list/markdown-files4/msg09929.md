Looks great! I'm excited!

Does AAE also apply to search? Or is it only KV that benefits from this? The 
reason I'm asking is of cause that this list has seen some cases of bit rot in 
merge index files.

Given that AAE necessarily add extra I/O, should we expect that I/O to 
noticeably effect throughput of K/V?

Thanks,

Kresten

Riak Users,

I am extremely excited to let you all know we have reached RC1 status on Riak 
1.3.0. We all know this has been a long release cycle, but the investment we 
put into testing and automation (see: https://github.com/basho/riak\_test and 
https://github.com/basho/giddyup) will pay off tremendously down the road with 
stability and more timely releases. If you are new to Riak, we name a build 
"release candidate" when we believe it could become the final released version. 
 Given that, we hope you all give it a try and let us know what you think.

So what is new?

https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/1.3/RELEASE-NOTES.md

Enough talk, where is it?

http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.3.0rc1/downloads/

One note about our amazing new docs page, it has not been completely updated 
for 1.3.0, but will be soon.

For commercial users of Riak Enterprise, the 1.3 release includes a technical 
preview of advanced multi-datacenter replication capabilities. For more 
information, see Riak Enterprise docs at http://docs.basho.com/riakee/latest/


Thanks as always to the best community out there!
- Everyone at Basho
