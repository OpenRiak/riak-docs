The "Latency" values are the amount of time it takes an operation to be sent to 
riak and the response be received by Basho Bench. All values are from the view 
point of Basho Bench as a client. 

Yes, the 99% curve means that 99% of the request/receive operation cycles have 
been below this value.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; at the moment i evaluate a graphics (summary.png) generated with Basho Bench 
&gt; and R.
&gt; I wonder what the meaning of this 99th, 99.9th and 95th Percentile curves are.
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is that for e.g. 99th curve means: 99% of all measured latencies 
&gt; (one measured value for each node at a definite time) have been lower than 
&gt; the shown value at one point in time.
&gt; 
&gt; I only have three nodes in this cluster, so i guess the 99.9th, 99th and 95th 
&gt; curves are showing the latency for one of the nodes in this particular case. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone explain it to me please.
&gt; 
&gt; I added one summary picture.
&gt; 
&gt; greetings christian
