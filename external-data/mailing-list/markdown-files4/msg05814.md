I'm setting up a new cluster with an iptables firewall, and I'm trying 
to figure out which ports to open. It looks like I need 4369, 8099, 8098 
(http), and a configurable range. Can I configure the range to be a 
single port, or is there a minimum number of required ports? What 
determines how many ports I need?


Thanks,
Paul Gross
