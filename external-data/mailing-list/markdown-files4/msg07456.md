Hi All,

Although everything seems to be operating fine, all 3 nodes in a development 
environment are continuously logging:

[error] &lt;0.106.0&gt;@riak\_core\_ring:check\_tainted:216 Error: 
riak\_core\_ring/ring\_ready called on tainted ring

with occasional:

[error] &lt;0.101.0&gt;@riak\_core\_ring:check\_tainted:216 Error: 
riak\_core\_ring/reconcile :: reconciling tainted external ring

[error] &lt;0.101.0&gt;@riak\_core\_ring:check\_tainted:216 Error: 
riak\_core\_ring/reconcile :: reconciling tainted internal ring

[error] &lt;0.107.0&gt;@riak\_core\_ring:check\_tainted:216 Error: 
riak\_core\_gossip/send\_ring\_to :: Sending tainted ring over gossip

This seems to have started sometime yesterday, but at this point, because the 
logs have rolled over so many times, I cannot pinpoint a particular event when 
these started.

I did stop and start all nodes, but I haven't tried to remove or add a node.

Any recommendations appreciated!

Thanks,
Todd
