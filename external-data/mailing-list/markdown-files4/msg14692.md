Alex -

Let's take a step back and try out the "famous" index and "animals"
bucket type, which you have confirmed are set up correctly. This
(untested) code should create an object ("cat-1") in the "cats" bucket
(within the "animals" bucket type), which will then be indexed by the
"famous" index:

bucket = client.bucket\_type('animals').bucket('cats')
obj = RiakObject(client, bucket, 'cat-1')
obj.content\_type = 'application/json'
obj.data = { 'name': 'Felix', 'species': 'Felis catus' }
obj.store()

&gt; Hi Luke,
&gt;
&gt; I also tried with a normal bucket "cats" using the type "animals" as the
&gt; documentation seemed to suggest and gave me the same error but this time
&gt; saying that "cats" was not found as an index... so... still no clue how to
&gt; do it.
&gt;
&gt; This is an alternate code I did looking at the Python client API
&gt; documentation, etc...
&gt;
&gt; client.create\_search\_index('men')
&gt; bucket = client.bucket('accounts')
&gt; bucket.enable\_search()
&gt; bucket.set\_property('search\_index', 'men')
&gt; key = bucket.new('alex', data={"username":"Alex","age":25,"sex":"male"},
&gt; content\_type='application/json')
&gt; key.store()
&gt; print bucket.search('sex=male')
&gt;
&gt; Again, it says "accounts" is not an index... in this code no bucket types
&gt; are used, just a plain bucket "accounts"... what is wrong? what is missing
&gt; for it to work??
&gt;
&gt; This is really frustrating.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Alex

&gt;&gt; Hi Alex -
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You correctly created the "famous" index, as well as correctly
&gt;&gt; associated it with the bucket \*type\* "animals". Note that a bucket
&gt;&gt; type is not the same thing as a bucket in previous versions of Riak. A
&gt;&gt; bucket type is a way to give 1 or more buckets within that type the
&gt;&gt; same properties. You'll have to use different code in your Riak client
&gt;&gt; to use bucket types:
