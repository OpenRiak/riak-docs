&gt; How should we set up a development environment so that Riak and all other

Hi, Mathieu. I think a good place to start might be reading another
recent thread on this list about "Integrating Riak":
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2011-November/006615.html

Specifically, Sean Cribb's suggestion near the end of the thread,
about using -pz and -s options in Riak's vm.args configuration, will
likely give you the best flexibility in developing so closely to Riak.
