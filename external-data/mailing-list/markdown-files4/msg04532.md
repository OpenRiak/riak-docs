&gt; My colleague checked Bitcask implementation and found that it uses "fcntl

&gt; O\_SYNC being set by this way will be ignored by kernel and has no effect. To 
&gt; make it work, Betcask should call "open" system call with O\_SYNC option.

Tatsuya, thanks for the pointer on this. I will take a look into this
more carefully tomorrow.
