The X there indicates that it does not support connection pooling out of
the box in contrast to the check. I'd look at poolboy (to use in
conjunction with riakc\_pb\_socket) and riakpool (which pulls in
riak-erlang-client as a dependency).

&gt; Looking at http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/Client-Libraries/ I

&gt; looking at Erlang riak client source code I would say that it doesn't
&gt; support Cluster connections/pools out of box. And I have to develop my own
&gt; code to have load balancing/connection pool. Is it right and the
&gt; documentation is incorrect and needs to be updated?
