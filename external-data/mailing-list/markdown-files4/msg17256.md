David:

riak\_kv is actually a (semi)independent library we incorporate (along with many 
others) into Riak, the product. There are times where riak\_kv, the library, is 
actually not versioned when we release a new Riak, so those two version numbers 
are not necessarily going to always be the same.

I'm pondering upgrading riak from 2.1.3 to 2.1.4 and got myself confused 
confirming that I really am running 2.1.3 at the moment.

I installed riak from here: 
https://packagecloud.io/basho/riak/packages/ubuntu/trusty/riak\_2.1.3-1\_amd64.deb.

and all of this looks promising:

$ riak version
2.1.3

$ ls /usr/lib/riak/releases/
2.1.3 RELEASES start\_erl.data

$ dpkg -l | grep riak
ii riak 2.1.3-1 amd64 Riak is a distributed data store

but then there's also this:

$ sudo riak-admin status | grep riak\_kv\_version
riak\_kv\_version : &lt;&lt;"2.1.2-0-gf969bba"&gt;&gt;

I really wanted riak\_kv\_version to say 2.1.3-.

I'm clearly paranoid, but can someone help me feel better about this?

Thanks much.
