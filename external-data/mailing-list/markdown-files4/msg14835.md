If you upgrade to 2.0, then there is a ring-resize feature built right in.
That might be a better approach to take.

&gt; Hello All,
&gt;
&gt; What would be the best tool for moving data from one riak cluster to
&gt; another?
&gt;
&gt; To give some context, we needed to change the ring\_creation\_size and
&gt; build out a new cluster.
&gt; Once the cluster was built I initially tried riak-data-migrator
&gt; (https://github.com/basho-labs/riak-data-migrator) but that caused the
&gt; load across the old cluster to skyrocket and the tool would time out
&gt; before it could actually receive any data.
&gt;
&gt; I then attempted riak-admin backup/restore. The backup took ~ 2 days.
&gt; The restore seemed much slower going ~ 10 megabytes/hour. Needing to
&gt; fill 26gb/node this seemed impractical.
&gt;
&gt; Are there any other recommended ways to migrate data? We're using
&gt; leveldb as the only back-end. Appreciate any help.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mark
