Hi, Mark.

You've already received a little advice generally so I won't pile on that part, 
but one thing stood out to me:

&gt; My client has sent me a backup from one of their cluster nodes. bitcask 
&gt; data,. rings and config.

Unless I'm misunderstanding what you're doing, what you're working on will not 
get you the data from the whole cluster, but the fraction of the data that was 
stored on the one node that you have a backup from. Just a warning, in case you 
hadn't realized this.

-Justin
