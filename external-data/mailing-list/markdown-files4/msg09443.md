Ya, I would probably say more vm's mean less vnodes per vm. I would most likely 
go in that direction...

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; We're seeing enough thrashing and low-memory on our production ring that 
&gt; we've decided to upgrade our hardware. The real question is should we scale 
&gt; up or out.
&gt; 
&gt; Currently our ring is 512 partitions. We know that it's a sub-optimal size 
&gt; but we can't easily solve that now. We're currently running a search-heavy 
&gt; app on 5 8GB VMs. I'm debating between moving the VMs up to 16GB, or adding a 
&gt; few more 8GB VMs.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of the talk in #riak has pushed me towards adding more machines (thus 
&gt; lowering the per node number of partitions) but I wanted to do a quick sanity 
&gt; check here with folks that it's better than scaling up my current machines.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
