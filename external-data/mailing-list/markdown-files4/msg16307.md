Hi,

I need to do a ring-resizing on a live cluster. The documentation (
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/ring-resizing/ ) is not
very detailed, and I'm missing one important information: how much free
space do I need on the nodes to perform the ring resizing properly ?
Having enough space seems critical as per the documentation, but there
is no way to compute the free space required.

Any information on that and also feedback on ring resizing on live
cluster would be much apreciated.

Thanks,
dams
