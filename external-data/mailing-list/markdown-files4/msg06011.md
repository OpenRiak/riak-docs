Adam,

Because Protocol Buffers (or gzipped-JSON for that matter) is a binary
format, it's unlikely that it will conform with the UTF-8 charset, which is
currently required to send the data over into the Javascript VM. Our
version of Spidermonkey doesn't yet have support for Buffer or any other
means of working directly with binary data, so it must be UTF-8 (since we
convert the riak\_object record into a JSON form before invoking).

&gt; I want to make sure i do my due dilligence, though... If we were to store
&gt; as protobuf (or any binary format) but are the possibilities for analyzing
&gt; the data with Riak Map Reduce? Would we need to include all of the
&gt; functions needed to deserialize the PB in our javascript code we send to
&gt; the server?
