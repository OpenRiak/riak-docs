Riak Rubyists,

Since Rails 3 final was released yesterday, I cut new beta gems of ripple and 
riak-client last night. The only additions are:

\* Fixed a translation bug (thanks Adam Hunter)
\* Net::HTTP will break up headers larger than 8KB (curb is still broken)
\* Fixed problem in Riak::CacheStore
\* Ripple is pegged to ActiveModel 3.0.0

Ripple/riak-client 0.8.0 final is only days away, I think.
