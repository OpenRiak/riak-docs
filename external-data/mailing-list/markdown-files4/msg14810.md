Hi Guido,

This could be a solution; although I would try to do it in an homogeneous
system where only one NoSQL DB would be around if possible :)

Thanks!
Alex

&gt; Maybe what you are looking for is a combination of both, say, your KV
&gt; data in Riak with a combination of background processes able to build the
&gt; necessary searching graphs in Neo4J, in such way your data is secure in a
&gt; Riak cluster and searchable on several Neo4J servers.
&gt;
&gt; That's just an idea which might be not do-able, hope it helps,

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; For some time already I have in mind building a kind of social network
&gt; myself. Is pretty ambitious project although it doesn't have in mind to be
&gt; a new facebook; but still data will be quite big and complex.
&gt;
&gt; I like Riak and I had been following since version 0.14, and new
&gt; additions in Riak 2.0 seem to help a lot in how to model the data; although
&gt; relationships will be unavoidable.
&gt;
&gt; Some friends suggested me to use Graph Databases instead. How would Riak
&gt; compare to Graph Databases for this use case? Is it doable to create a
&gt; social network entirely from Riak? Or may not be recommended?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Alex
