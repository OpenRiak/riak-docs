Hi all,

I just added another node to my cluster (moving from 1 to 2) and was
surprised by some behavior.

As I understand replication, with an n\_val of 3 (default), all nodes will
have all data until I add my 4th node. First, is this right?

Second, I watched my disk usage on node 1 go from 1GB to 600MB after adding
the second node. If I still have a full copy of all data on node 1, what
was in that 400MB?

Thanks,

Jimmy
