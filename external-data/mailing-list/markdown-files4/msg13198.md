Try to take a look at this thread from November where I experienced a
similar problem:
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2013-November/014027.html

The following mails in the thread mentions things you try to correct
the problem, and what I ended up doing with the help of Basho
employees.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; Below is the transfers info:

&gt; ~# riak-admin transfers

&gt; Attempting to restart script through sudo -u riak
&gt; 'r...@ccc.ccc.ccc.ccc' waiting to handoff 7 partitions
&gt; 'r...@bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb' waiting to handoff 7 partitions
&gt; 'r...@aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa' waiting to handoff 5 partitions
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; It's stuck with all those handoffs for few days now.
&gt; riak-admin ring\_status gives me the same info like the one I mentioned when
&gt; opened the case.
&gt; I noticed AAA.AAA.AAA.AAA experience more load than other servers as it's
&gt; responsible for almost half of the data.
&gt; Is it safe to add another machine to the cluster in order to relief
&gt; AAA.AAA.AAA.AAA even when the issue with handoffs is not yet resolved?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Ivaylo
