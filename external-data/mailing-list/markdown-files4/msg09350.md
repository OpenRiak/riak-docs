&gt; The way Riak is designed is far from the most efficient way to replicate
&gt; data across a WAN. A lot of that code was/is written with assumptions of
&gt; LAN and fairly predictable latency. This is one of the reasons we have a
&gt; separate piece of software that performs this task.
&gt;

I think I gave the wrong impression by saying our WAN support is a separate
piece of software. It is a separate set of code but is tightly integrated
with our enterprise version of Riak. Just wanted to clarify.
