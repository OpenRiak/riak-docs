Regarding the creation of a 'buildbot' user that shouldn't be the case, so
I'll create a task to look into it. Sorry that the package was
misconfigured for your environment! To be sure I check the correct thing,
you were trying to use the
BASHOriak-0.14.2-1-Solaris10-i386.pkg.gz
package
correct?

I'm glad you got it all sorted out with Dan's help.

Thanks,
-Jared

&gt;
&gt; Sorry, that was after the last act of a desperate man :-)
&gt;
&gt; Installing the package in this environment at least, required a
&gt; 'buildbot' user and that was who owned the dirs after install.
&gt; A riak user was created but didn't have access.
&gt;
&gt; Reinstalling from the package, then chown-ing /opt/riak to riak:staff,
&gt; followed by chmod-ing /opt/riak to 755 and start/ping/PUT/etc all now
&gt; work!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
