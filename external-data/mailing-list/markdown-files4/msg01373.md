Riak Recap for Oct. 22 - 24

1) Alex Payne (@al3x), Chief Product & Technology Officer at Bank
Simple, shared a few details on Quora about what software they are
currently investigating. Riak got a shout out.

Check it out here ---&gt;

2) allen\_ and benblack had a conversation in #riak about things to
look out for when benchmarking Riak.

3) Q --- Is there a limiting factor for the number of buckets in a
cluster? (from \_\_alex via #riak)

 A --- Buckets using the default bucket properties are free. Each
bucket with non-default bucket properties is stored in the gossiped
ring state. As long as you accept the default bucket properties,
buckets consume no resources.

4) Apologies for the last minute notification here but if you're in or
around Minneapolis tonight, Basho Hacker Scott Fritchie (@slfritchie)
is giving at talk on Riak for the Ruby Users of Minnesota. This is
happening at 7PM local time.

Details here ---&gt; http://ruby.mn/
