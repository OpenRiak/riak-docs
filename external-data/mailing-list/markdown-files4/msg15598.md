&gt; Yes. I'm using POJO and annotating one of the field with RiakIndex. When I'm 
&gt; reading the object with the key, as the tag field is not part of the object, 
&gt; while writing I dont have the tag value while writing the object.
&gt; 
&gt; Class Foo {
&gt; 
&gt; private String fooId;
&gt; 
&gt; @RiakIndex(name="barid")
&gt; 
&gt; private String barid;
&gt; 
&gt; .....
&gt; 
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; When I'm storing the object, I set the barid for the object and storing the 
&gt; object. Annotation is taking care of tagging the object with barid.
&gt; 
&gt; When I query the object with barId, I have the barId value so I'm setting 
&gt; barId to object and writing it. But If I lookup the object with fooId, as 
&gt; barId value is not part of the object I cant tag the object with barid. SO 
&gt; when I'm writing the object I'm losing the association .
&gt; 
&gt; So Is there any thing I'm missing to make it part of the object state. That 
&gt; way as you said, When I read-modify-write, the tag value exist all the time.

Hi Santi,

Iâ€™m having trouble following your exact issue. Is it possible for you to share 
the problematic code so we can try to reproduce it here?

Thanks,
Chris
