Bob is right, it's a simple typo. Please send a pull request or open an
issue on the tracker. https://github.com/basho/riak\_wiki/issues

&gt; It sounds like there is a typo, I would assume that it should be "the
&gt; input of later evaluations will include the output of earlier
&gt; evaluations". It's not really a reduction otherwise.

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I see the following on the Basho wiki for Riak [1]:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The important thing to understand is that the function defining the
&gt; &gt; reduce phase may be evaluated multiple times, and the input of later
&gt; &gt; evaluations will include the input of earlier evaluations.
&gt; &gt; For example, a reduce phase may implement the set-union function. In
&gt; &gt; that case, the first set of inputs might be [1,2,2,3], and the output
&gt; &gt; would be [1,2,3]. When the phase receives more inputs, say [3,4,5],
&gt; &gt; the function will be called with the concatentation of the two lists:
&gt; &gt; [1,2,3,4,5].
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This description isn't clear to me as the behavior I'm seeing is that
&gt; &gt; the \_output\_ of earlier evaluations is included as input to later
&gt; &gt; evaluations. Unfortunately, the example yields the same results
&gt; &gt; irrespective of whether it is the input or the output of the first
&gt; &gt; evaluation, so it doesn't clear anything up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Brian
