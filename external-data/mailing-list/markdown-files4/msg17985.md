&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I am confused about the relation between the statistics "node\_puts" and
&gt; "vnode\_puts", yes, I have read the user guide.
&gt; For instance, this is the output from "riak-admin status | grep
&gt; node\_puts", I don't understand why vnode\_puts is much bigger(40 times) than
&gt; node\_puts, my cluster has 3 nodes.

&gt; vnode\_puts Number of PUT operations coordinated by local vnodes on this
&gt; node in the last minute
&gt;
&gt; node\_puts Number of PUTs coordinated by this node, where a PUT is sent to
&gt; a local vnode in the last minute
&gt; Best Regards

Hi Luna,

VNode puts and gets are registered each time a VNode performs an operation.
Any time a Node coordinates a client operation, there will be `n\_val` VNode
operations. However, not all VNode operations occur as a result of
client-side operations. In particular AAE tree rebuilds, AAE repairs and
realtime or fullsync MDC replication are counted at the VNode level, but
don't register at the node level.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
