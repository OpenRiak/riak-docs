Yes, use logical CPU count.

&gt; When you say "CPU" does that mean "logical CPU core"? Or is this actually 
&gt; referring to physical CPU cores?
&gt; 
&gt; E.g. On my laptop with 4 physical cores + HyperThreading, should I set +S to 
&gt; +S 4:4
&gt; 
&gt; You hint that it doesn't matter, but I just wanted to trick you into 
&gt; explicitly saying something.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Summary:
&gt; 
&gt; leveldb has a higher read and write throughput in Riak if the Erlang 
&gt; scheduler count is limited to half the number of CPU cores. Tests have 
&gt; demonstrated improvements of 15% to 80% greater throughput.
&gt; 
&gt; The scheduler limit is set in the vm.args file:
&gt; 
&gt; +S x:x
&gt; 
&gt; where "x" is the number of schedulers Erlang may use. Erlang's default value 
&gt; of "x" is the total number of CPUs in the system. For Riak installations 
&gt; using leveldb, the recommendation is to set "x" to half the number of CPUs. 
&gt; Virtual environments are not yet tested.
&gt; 
&gt; Example: for 24 CPU system
&gt; 
&gt; +S 12:12
&gt; 
&gt; Discussion:
&gt; 
&gt; We have tested a limited number of CPU configurations and customer loads. In 
&gt; all cases, there is a performance increase when the +S option is added to the 
&gt; vm.args file to reduce the number of Erlang schedulers. The working 
&gt; hypothesis is that the Erlang schedulers perform enough "busy wait" work that 
&gt; they always create context switch away from leveldb when leveldb is actually 
&gt; the only system task with real work.
&gt; 
&gt; The tests included 8 CPU (no hyper threading, physical cores only) and 24 CPU 
&gt; (12 physical cores with hyper threading) systems. All were 64bit Intel 
&gt; platforms. Generalized findings:
&gt; 
&gt; • servers running higher number of vnodes (64) had larger performance 
&gt; gains than those with fewer (8)
&gt; • servers running SSD arrays had larger performance gains than those 
&gt; running SATA arrays
&gt; • Get and Write operations showed performance gains, 2i query 
&gt; operations (leveldb iterators) were unchanged
&gt; • Not recommended for servers with less than 8 CPUs (go no lower than 
&gt; +S 4:4)
&gt; 
&gt; Performance improvements were as high as 80% over extended, heavily loaded 
&gt; intervals on servers with SSD arrays and 64 vnodes. No test resulted in worse 
&gt; performance due to the addition of +S x:x.
&gt; 
&gt; The +S x:x configuration change does not have to be implemented 
&gt; simultaneously to an entire Riak cluster. The change may be applied to a 
&gt; single server for verification. Steps: update the vm.args file, then restart 
&gt; the Riak node. Erlang command line changes to schedules were ineffective.
&gt; 
&gt; This configuration change has been running in at least one large, 
&gt; multi-datacenter production environment for several months.
