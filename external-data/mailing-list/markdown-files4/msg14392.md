Luwak is definitely EOL'd and RiakCS is our large object store going
forward. It is a far superior design compared to Luwak and handles very
large file sizes.

&gt; Riak CS is designed to be the same interface as Amazon S3. It can be run

&gt;
&gt; Think of it as a way to run your own S3.
&gt;
&gt; I think the hard limit on Riak objects is 50MB, but the recommended size
&gt; is less than 1MB per object. The main reason for that is latency. It's
&gt; faster to get 100x1MB chunks from the entire cluster than it is to get
&gt; 1x100MB chunk from a single server. It's also easier for disks to pull a
&gt; 1MB object without delaying any other requests than pulling a 100MB object,
&gt; which may end up queuing other requests made after.
&gt;
&gt; There used to be a project called luwak that was built into Riak and
&gt; handled chunking files like this, but it has been EOL'd. Perhaps someone
&gt; can shed some light on this. Is RiakCS the final solution for binary
&gt; storage? Or is there another way to store larger objects in Riak?
&gt;
&gt; RiakCS is wonderful, but it does seem overkill for some uses where you
&gt; don't need to expose an S3 interface, don't need the S3 permission
&gt; structure, and really just want file storage.

&gt; Hi Hector,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your response :) highly appreciated. I have more questions
&gt; though.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Riak CS has to be implemented in Amazon S3? Or can I house it myself with
&gt; own managed servers?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What is the limit for an object in Standard Riak? Large objects should go
&gt; to Riak CS, but what would be a limit for the Standard Riak? I may want to
&gt; save pictures, for example, in binary data... not a RAW version, but like
&gt; processed photo uploads from users... I think Standard Riak can hold that
&gt; with no problem, but it would be good to know the size limit for a key's
&gt; content.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Alex

&gt; &gt; Hi Hector,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I see, I always thought that Riak CS was the same as Riak just that you
&gt; run
&gt; &gt; it in Amazon S3... they are actually different...
&gt;
&gt; Correct, but it is important to note that Riak is still at the core of
&gt; Riak CS.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; So... if I have a social network and one of the features is that they can
&gt; &gt; share video, I would use a normal Riak cluster for the webapp and data
&gt; and a
&gt; &gt; Riak CS cluster for the video storage/streaming... am I right?
&gt;
&gt; That seems like a reasonable conclusion.
&gt;
&gt; Riak is fundamentally a distributed key/value store for low latency
&gt; access to smaller pieces of data. Riak CS is an S3/Swift
&gt; API-compatible object storage platform with a little higher request
&gt; latency, but also the added ability to house very large objects
&gt; (backups, raw images, video).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; By the way, couldn't this "range header" be implemented in standard Riak?
&gt; &gt; might be a good thing to have so you don't need 2 clusters for this
&gt; matter.
&gt;
&gt; It could some day. Right now, separating the clusters is best because
&gt; tuning a single cluster for both use cases would be difficult.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Alex

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Alex,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; For this type of problem, you may want to look into Riak CS. [0] It is
&gt; &gt;&gt; an object storage platform built on top of Riak.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; When you GET an object from Riak CS, you can specify a Range header to
&gt; &gt;&gt; get the object by its byte offset. [1]

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi there,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Imagine that I want to use Riak for a video service like Youtube and I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; save
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the video file in Riak... is there a way to stream the contents of 1
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; key? I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; know we can stream keys... but what about its content?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It would be pretty troublesome to have to wait for the full data to be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; downloaded $bucket-&gt;get('myvideo') to be able to serve it... as they
&gt; can
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pretty big files.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Is there any recommendation to store/get big files like videos? or it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be better to use some other system than Riak for the job?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,
