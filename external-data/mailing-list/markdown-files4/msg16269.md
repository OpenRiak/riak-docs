HI,

Iâ€™ve got a problem in using Riak-CS as file storage cluster.

Now the bitcask folder has 9GB of data in it, and the RAM usage of Riak is &gt;8GB.

Just checked that the bitcask backend will put all the keys into the RAM, but 
how come now I would get this large amount of RAM being used?

Is there any way to change the Riak-CS to use leveldb instead of bitcask? 
Besides, currently I got lots of data in the bitcask, how can I migrate the 
data into leveldb?

Thanks.

Anita
