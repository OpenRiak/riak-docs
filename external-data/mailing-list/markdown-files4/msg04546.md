&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; We have a cluster of two nodes.
&gt; 
&gt; We add keys to a bucket :
&gt; curl -v -X PUT -d '{"prop":"val"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
&gt; http://riak/store/jdTestBucket/key1?w=1
&gt; curl -v -X PUT -d '{"prop":"val"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
&gt; http://riak/store/jdTestBucket/key2?w=1
&gt; curl -v -X PUT -d '{"prop":"val"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
&gt; http://riak/store/jdTestBucket/key3?w=1
&gt; curl -v -X PUT -d '{"prop":"val"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
&gt; http://riak/store/jdTestBucket/key4?w=1
&gt; 
&gt; We shut down one node.
&gt; 
&gt; We delete the keys:
&gt; curl -v -X DELETE http://riak/store/jdTestBucket/key1?w=1
&gt; curl -v -X DELETE http://riak/store/jdTestBucket/key2?w=1
&gt; curl -v -X DELETE http://riak/store/jdTestBucket/key3?w=1
&gt; curl -v -X DELETE http://riak/store/jdTestBucket/key4?w=1
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We list the keys :
&gt; curl -i http://riak/store/jdTestBucket?keys=true\&props=false
&gt; 
&gt; All keys are listed.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it normal?
&gt; 

Yes, keys are only deleted when all the values are tombstones and all
the nodes are up. In theory bringing the other node back up and
re-reading the keys will read-repair the keys on the node that was down
to be tombstones and then hopefully they'll be removed.

However, deletes are flaky on 0.14. Things should be a little better in
1.0.
