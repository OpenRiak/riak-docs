Ah, the second bullet point ("Don't add nodes one at a time if you're
adding multiple nodes") clarifies it perfectly. I would've thought
otherwise since there are possibilities of false not\_found responses during
node addition.

Thanks for pointing me to that page.

&gt; I believe they actually recommend adding all the nodes you want to add in a

&gt;
&gt; If you add nodes one by one, the objects will have to do multiple
&gt; transitions, since each added node will cause a redistribution of which
&gt; nodes will be responsible for which objects, causing a hand-off process
&gt; each
&gt; time, and you will consume more traffic, time and more resources to get the
&gt; same final result.
