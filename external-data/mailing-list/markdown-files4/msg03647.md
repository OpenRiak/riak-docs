Hi all, but mainly directed at Sean Cribbs ...

&gt;From the slides at
http://www.slideshare.net/seancribbs/introducing-riak-and-ripple , slide
number 143 in particular, it seems that Ripple already supports indexes,
because that item is highlighted on the slide. However, I can't see any
mention of it in the documentation, mainly, the list of modules and methods.

Since Ripple currently doesn't support using a property as a key, I am
searching for a way to efficiently work around that. I'm sure this has been
dealt with by somebody already.

Thanks,
Tom
