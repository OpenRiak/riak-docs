Hello.
I've used riak for online processing of incoming data and faced with
problem.
I've used riak-erlang client. It has a function that allows to get all keys
that are in the bucket. But I'd like to receive data continuously as thay
arrive (that is to realize a subscribe)
I asked this question on SO and got the answer that the standart tools to
do it will not work.
I'd like to realize this opportunity. Is it possible to do this by
modifying the riak-erlang-clent?
