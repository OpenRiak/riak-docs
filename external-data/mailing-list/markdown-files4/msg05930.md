Hi Bryan,

That sounds like the problem.

Thanks,
Mat

&gt; Hi, Mat.  Is your reduce phase implemented in Javascript?  If so, it's
&gt; subject to a hardcoded five second timeout in erlang\_js.  Each
&gt; Javascript call a MapReduce query makes must finish in under five
&gt; seconds, regardless of the timeout set for the whole query.  Phases
&gt; implemented in Erlang are not subject to this restriction.
