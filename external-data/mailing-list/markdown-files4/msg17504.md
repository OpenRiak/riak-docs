Hi Magnus,

This is what I found on the conf file

 nodename = riak@127.0.0.1

However, it doesn’t work. I tried with Riak KV and everything is OK. The 
problem is Riak TS on OS X because on Ubuntu works

Kind regards,
Humberto

&gt; Hi, have anyone got this error "vm.args needs to have a -name parameter.” I 
&gt; was trying to test last version (1.3.0) of Riak TS, but every time that I try 
&gt; to start it fails and show me that message
&gt; 
&gt; I am using Mac OS The Captain

&gt; Hi Humberto,
&gt; 
&gt; Please check that your riak.conf file contains a line like
&gt; 
&gt; nodename = r...@ip.addr
&gt; 
&gt; or
&gt; 
&gt; nodename = riak@fqdn
&gt; 
&gt; This line should contain a distributed Erlang node name [0]. You can chose 
&gt; any valid node name.
&gt; 
&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Magnus
