As of 1.1, we have validated that at \_least\_ 100 nodes will work as
expected and haven't seen any signs of distributed Erlang being a
problem at that scale. We have plans to push that (validated) number
up quite a bit this year and quantify the point at which distributed
Erlang will become a problem.

I also happen to know there is at least one person running Riak that
is adding data at a rate in excess of 0.5TB...per day. 16 TB/year is
pretty straightforward in my mind. :)
