Hi Toby,

I am actually working on a rewrite of the Galaxy role that we used to have
up there to be simpler and support all of the 2.x features of Riak. You can
access it here: https://github.com/basho-labs/ansible-riak/tree/dev-2.x

I would greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions as well as any
contributions you may have from your testing on Ubuntu / Debian, since I am
using it with CentOS7 and may not have time to test it with Ubuntu for a
little while still.

Chris

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Searching for riak roles on Ansible Galaxy brings up this one:
&gt; https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles/777
&gt;
&gt; However this is listed as only supporting RHEL 6 and Ubuntu 12.04.
&gt;
&gt; Ubuntu 14.04 is the current long-term-support version, and what we're
&gt; deploying stuff to; it'd be great if the Ansible roles available could
&gt; support it too.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Toby
