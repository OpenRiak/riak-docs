Will there be a release soon that has the fix? If not, what are the
operations that will be blocked?

&gt; &gt; Excellent. When it goes into master does that mean a .deb will be
&gt; available
&gt; &gt; at http://downloads.basho.com/riak/CURRENT/ ?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Non-blocking key \_listing\_
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Am I correct in assuming non-blocking key listings amounts to
&gt; non-blocking
&gt; &gt; when doing a key filter?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Non-blocking key \_listing\_ will land in master sometime before end of
&gt; &gt;&gt; August. There are a number of changes across the system that have to
&gt; &gt;&gt; be made first and it all has to be reviewed/integrated.
