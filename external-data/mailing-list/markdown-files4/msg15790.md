Thanks Magnus

I'm using memtest86 on set of another 3 servers with identical configuration
to see if I can trigger that as well.
I cannot do it on the failing node at the moment since it's a remote site
but I agree it's a strong indication of RAM module problem.
As a test I moved var/lib/riak to RAID6 array on that node and Riak crashed
after few hours with segfault.

Also I had a random Segmentation fault when launched "top".

Thanks
