"The io\_mode setting specifies which code module Bitcask should use for
file access. The available settings are:

erlang (default) — Writes are made via Erlang's built-in file API
nif — Writes are made via direct calls to the POSIX C API"

These sentences mention 'writes' only, does it affect other file IO (reads,
stats)?

&gt; Hi!
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone please explain in more details what kind of negative impact has
&gt; the 'nif' bitcask IO mode and what worst-case scenarios can increase
&gt; latencies or cause IO collapses?
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; "In general, the nif IO mode provies higher throughput for certain
&gt; workloads, but it has the potential to negatively impact the Erlang VM,
&gt; leading to higher worst-case latencies and possible throughput collapse."
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
