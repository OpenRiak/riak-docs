Marcel,
&gt; /usr/lib64/riak/lib/os\_mon-2.2.6/priv/bin/memsup: Erlang has closed.
&gt; Erlang has closed
&gt; 
&gt; 


There isn't anything to help us identify the issue here. This line indicates 
that the Erlang VM hosting Riak has shutdown, but does not indicate the reason.

Are there any other files in your log directory? If there are, what do they 
say? What version of Riak are you running? If it's &lt;=Riak 0.14.2 then you may 
need to use sasl to investigate the underlying cause. Is there a sasl directory 
inside your log directory?

&gt; Erlang has closed
&gt; 
&gt; nothing more 
&gt; 
&gt; Can you explain me what is wrong ? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
