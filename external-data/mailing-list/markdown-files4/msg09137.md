Ah, ok.
Then I highly recommend following Jayson Barley's approach, in the previous
email. Query SQL server, compose a POCO type object, serialize it to JSON,
and store it in Riak either via the C++/C# client, or just use an HTTP
client and PUT/POST it over http.

&gt; My preferred programming language is C++ or more recently C#. I have done
&gt; some Java programming but that was a while back. When I have played with
&gt; JavaScript it was always in the context of Microsoft’s version of
&gt; JavaScript.\*\*\*\*

&gt;
&gt; I would like to migrate about 5 tables. Our database is very unstructured
&gt; so there are few to no relationships so I don’t plan on migrating
&gt; relationships.\*\*\*\*
&gt;
&gt; \*\* \*\*
&gt;
&gt; The migration is really for a demo where I do a query on SQL Server and as
&gt; close as I can (based on the model that I create) retrieve the same type of
&gt; information using Riak and compare the performance. Then once I have a
&gt; basic apples to apples comparison I can show the other salient features of
&gt; Riak.\*\*\*\*

&gt;
&gt; Possibly. Let's step back for a second, however. Node.js might not be a
&gt; good fit for your migration script needs.
&gt;
&gt; A couple of questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1) What's your preferred programming language? Java, python, javascript,
&gt; etc?
&gt;
&gt; 2) What kind of data are you trying to migrate? (one table or many? what
&gt; kind of joins/relationships?)
&gt;
&gt; 3) What sort of use case/application is this migration for? \*\*\*\*

&gt; In this case the “server” is the Microsoft SQL Server. Right? So I need to

&gt;
&gt; Node.js http://nodejs.org/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs is a
&gt; server-side Javascript web application framework.
&gt;
&gt; It is completely unrelated to Java, and will have to be installed
&gt; separately. (It uses its own, javascript-specific package management app
&gt; called 'npm' (it's similar to ruby gems and python's eggs), plus has some
&gt; dependencies that you'll need to install via apt-get).
&gt;
&gt; Take a look here, for example, for installation instructions:

&gt; Sorry for the newbie question but is node.js part of the Java distribution
&gt; for a Ubuntu Linux Server or do I need to get it as a package? How is it
&gt; installed? I am assuming that once node.js is installed then the code will
&gt; be just like any other Java app. Right?\*\*\*\*

&gt; This Microsoft blog post gives a sample how to query the SQL Server\*\*\*\*
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; \*\*\*\*
&gt;
&gt; In the record loop, you use a Riak Node driver like riak-js.\*\*\*\*
&gt;
&gt; \*\*\*\*
&gt;
&gt; I can't share the scripts I wrote due to work but I can answer anything
&gt; you may have outside of providing the code.\*\*\*\*

&gt; Would you mind sharing that app? If you have time since I am not familiar
&gt; with Node.js would you mind showing me how you ran it as well as the
&gt; source. Thank you.\*\*\*\*

&gt;
&gt; There is nothing that I have come across. What I did in the past was run a
&gt; quick Node.js app that pulled data out of SQL Server using one of the
&gt; available drivers and serialize and write to Riak. It is not perfect, and
&gt; may be slow depending on the amount of data but it does work.\*\*\*\*
