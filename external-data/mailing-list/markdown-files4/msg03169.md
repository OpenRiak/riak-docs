You have me curious about the FactoryGirl Q; I don't know how factory girl 
works under the covers, but it should be a simple extension if it doesn't work 
out of the box.

&gt; Subject: Riak, RSpec, and Ripple
&gt; 

&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been working on figuring out how to create tests for my Riak database 
&gt; using RSpec and Ripple. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find 
&gt; documentation or even a tiny tutorial on it. Does anyone have any tips on how 
&gt; to create RSpec tests that use Ripple? I want to use Factory Girl too, but as 
&gt; they say, one step at a time.
&gt; 
&gt; So anyway, say I have a class User like so:
&gt; 
&gt; class User
&gt; include Ripple::Document
&gt; 
&gt; property :name, String, :presence =&gt; true
&gt; property :email, String, :presence =&gt; true
&gt; # and more fields here, whatever is needed
&gt; end
&gt; 
&gt; How would I create a RSpec test for this that can employ a Riak database???
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jesse L. Zamora
