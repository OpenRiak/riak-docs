Hi all,

In our system we have default implementation of querying the data from riak 
using “pagination”.
For some of the queries, with huge number of resulting records (into the tunes 
of 10,000+) , it is becoming an issue and hence we wanted to change it to use 
“cursorMark” as suggested here : 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Pagination+of+Results

While using cursorMark,

- It asks for unique key in the sort field. We didn’t have a unique 
key of our own so wanted to use “\_yz\_rk” but It gives error mentioned below.

- Query is accepted when sort parameter is changed to use “\_yz\_id” 
instead but It gives redundant / duplicate records. It is probably a known 
issue as mentioned 
here ( 
Pagination Warning). Solution recommended is to use { \_yz\_rt asc, \_yz\_rb asc, 
\_yz\_rk asc } instead but for each of them query is returning the following 
error :

 "error":{"msg":"Cursor functionality requires a sort containing 
a uniqueKey field tie breaker","code":400}

Can somebody please share some suggestions on this.

Thanks
Vipin
