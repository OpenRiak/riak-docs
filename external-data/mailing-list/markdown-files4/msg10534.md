Hey Brian,

That fork was put in place temporarily until the
riak\_cs\_kv\_multi\_backend specific bits were merged into
basho/riak-chef-cookbook. As of right now, the changes have been
merged, but the Berkshelf reference (in
hectcastro/vagrant-riak-cs-cluster) hasn't been updated. The primary
Chef cookbooks for Riak and Riak CS are:

\* https://github.com/basho/riak-chef-cookbook
\* https://github.com/basho/riak-cs-chef-cookbook

As soon as the we resolve issues with Vagrant 1.1+ and Berkshelf, the
vagrant-riak-cs-cluster repository references will be updated.

&gt;&gt; We have been maintaining our our chef cookbook for riak because the
&gt;&gt; old basho one didn't fit our needs. As part of testing riak-cs I see
&gt;&gt; there appears to be a fork that is referenced in the fast-track (via
&gt;&gt; the Vagrant instructions)
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/hectcastro/riak-chef-cookbook.git Is this the one
&gt;&gt; people are using now? I'd like to look at using what the community is
&gt;&gt; using, just want to make sure I'm looking at the right one.
&gt;&gt; TIA,
