Hi Sean,
I'm very sorry to say that you've found a featurebug.

There was a fix put in here https://github.com/basho/riak\_core/pull/332

But that means that the default timeout of 60 seconds is now honoured. In the 
past it was not.

As far as I can see the 2i endpoint never accepted a timeout argument, and it 
still does not.

The fix would be to add the timeout to the 2i API endpoints, and I'll do that 
straight away.

In the meantime, I wonder if streaming the results would help, or if you'd 
still hit the overall timeout?

Very sorry that you've run into this. Let me know if streaming helps, I've 
raised an issue here[1] if you want to track this bug

Cheers

Russell

&gt; I should have mentioned that I also tried:

&gt; -i
&gt; but still receive the 500 error below exactly at the 60 second mark. Is this 
&gt; a bug?
&gt; 
&gt; Secondary to getting this working at all, is this documented anywhere? and 
&gt; any way to set this timeout using the ruby riak client?
&gt; 
&gt; Stream may well work, but I'm going to have to make a number of changes on 
&gt; the client side to deal with the results.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The timeout isn't via a header, it's a query param -&gt; &timeout=xxxx
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; You can also use stream=true to stream the results.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We just upgraded to 1.4 and are having a big problem with some of our 
&gt;&gt;&gt; larger 2i queries. We have a few key queries that takes longer than 60 
&gt;&gt;&gt; seconds (usually about 110 seconds) to execute, but after going to 1.4 we 
&gt;&gt;&gt; can't seem to get around a 60 second timeout.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Right at the 60 second mark. What can I set to give my secondary index 
&gt;&gt;&gt; queries more time??
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is causing major problems for us :(
