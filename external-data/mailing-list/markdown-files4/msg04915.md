&gt; If you want to perform some kind of ad hoc querying, your only real option is

&gt; HTTP or Protocol Buffers), but you'll probably end up doing something that

&gt;
&gt; Query objects from Riak Search
&gt; Collect relationship IDs from Riak Search results

Is it possible to use a key to request an object and the things linked
directly (linkname,1) in one operation?
