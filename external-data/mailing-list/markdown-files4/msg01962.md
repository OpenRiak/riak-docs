... And redis and hadoop. More than a few of the newer nosql offerings 
do not bake security right into the cake.

Hi,

Newbie question. I am trying to find documentation about Riak 
security.

I have seen
http://wiki.basho.com/Network-Security-and-Firewall-Configurations.html
,

but I could not find much on access control.

Is it possible to secure access to Riak nodes? Does it offer 
something

similar to http://srp.stanford.edu/ (i.e. remote login)?

I read somewhere that Riak does not use encryption for exchange 
between

nodes. Is this (still) correct? What about communication with users
applications?

If the answer to the above question is no, then how can one secure a
Riak system properly?



Put an apache (or whatever) server in front and proxy the requests 
accordingly and setup the security through the underlying web service.



You -&gt; [ apache -&gt; riak ] (where [] is the box).

Or

You -&gt; apache -&gt; riak (where riak only allows requests from the 
apache server via the firewall on the riak server -- such as iptables)


The same problem exists in technologies like memcached.
