No one seems to have really answered either of my questions in any great
detail other than "don't do that" or "use redis" which to me just adds
another layer of complexity and potential bugginess to my end application or
fails to really describe what the problem is.

So really my questions can be boiled down to..

\* Why is key listing so slow?
\* What do people do in the context of purely using riak to do what I want,
have a big set of keys to iterate over?

&gt; If the key isn't something that you can use to retrieve the items you want,
&gt; what's the point of having it?
