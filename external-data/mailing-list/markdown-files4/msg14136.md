I think the number of characters preceding an asterisk is related to the 
tokenizer. White space or standard. One of them allows a one character search, 
the other three I believe. And this worked in riak 1.x. 

As pointed out elsewhere, the docs you really should be referring to for search 
capabilities in 2.x are the docs for whatever lucene/solr engine 2.x is 
targeting and then the basho docs that indicate caveats.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Currently, the wildcard must come at the end of the term in both cases, and 
&gt; &gt;&gt;must be preceded by a minimum of two characters.
&gt; 
&gt; Does it any way to able to search with one char?
&gt; 
&gt; I use RiakSearch to search contacts, and should show something for users 
&gt; when they type one char only
&gt; Maybe some combination with proximity search or custom tokenizers?
&gt; Also what about riak 2.0? Does it work there?
&gt; 
&gt; I have just one idea, create custom index with field first\_letter and put 
&gt; first char there and when only single char comes to input - I will search 
&gt; exact q=first\_letter:a
