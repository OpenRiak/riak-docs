Riak Recap for April 11 - 12
=====================

1) One last reminder about the Riak + Ops webinar that is happening
tomorrow at 2PM Eastern.

\* Details and registration here ---&gt;

2) Stodge released some Riak/Django Session Store code yesterday.

\* On BitBucket here ---&gt; https://bitbucket.org/stodge/django-riak-session
\* I also added it to the newly-created Django section on the wiki ---&gt;
http://wiki.basho.com/Community-Developed-Libraries-and-Projects.html

3) For any of our Japanese-speaking Riak users...

\* This brief blog post appeared a few days back ---&gt;

4) This tweet from Bradley Taylor is definitely worth passing along
---&gt; http://twitter.com/bradleyktaylor/status/57802592163594240

5) We added an entry to the Knowledge Base about using 3rd party JS
libs for M/R Functions.

\* Check it out here ---&gt;

6) Andy fixed an issue with the Python client that Eric Moritz
reported a few days ago.

\* Details here ---&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/pull/18

Thanks for catching that, Eric.

7) Speaking of Python (and Andy), there will be a Riak presentation at
the SF Python Meetup tonight. Andy and myself will be there. You have
about three hours until it starts if you're in the area and want to
make an appeareance.

\* Details here ---&gt; http://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/16514234/

8) We added some info to the wiki about Streaming MapReduce jobs that
some of you might find useful.

\* Read up on it here ---&gt;

9) Ryan Zezeski is now a member of the Basho Team!

\* Short blog about it here ---&gt;

10) aphry and mjr\_ had a brief chat in #riak that started with "If you
have an object that contains a JSON array of bucket, key pairs, can
you use that as a starting point in mapred?"

\* Gist here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/918603

11) A bit early but still worth mentioning: both Sean Cribbs and
Mathias Meyer will be speaking at Berlin Buzzwords in June.
