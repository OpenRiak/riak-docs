I saw a similar problem with Debian Wheezy a few weeks ago. Also solved by
pointing my host to the Squeeze directories on apt.basho.com. Somebody
should nudge the maintainer of the repo :)

&gt; Thanks Jared. Will try it out and let you know how it works.

&gt; Am new to Riak. I plan to connect from Python and work with it. I noticed
&gt; there was a Python library to interact with Riak and plan to use it. I
&gt; assume it is pretty well supported.
&gt;
&gt; However is there any requirement that Erlang (base or such) needs to be
&gt; installed? I guess the Riak installation will provide any necessary Erlang
&gt; needed. Or should I install Erlang from Ubuntu repo first?
&gt;
&gt; Finally - with installing with dpkg -i - will updates and patches to Riak
&gt; be
&gt; automatically updated as well when I do an apt-get upgrade? Or will be tuck
&gt; at the version I installed. Is there a way to install updates from Riak
&gt; command line or such?
&gt;
&gt; Thank for your help.
