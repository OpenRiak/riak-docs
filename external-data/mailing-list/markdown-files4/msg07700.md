Thinking further on this problem, Heroku provides an add-on system
that could be helpful.

If we could build a suitable distribution system that we can host
remotely to heroku, but that would work (and perhaps not even rely on
IP addresses, instead relying on app/dyno ids), then I think we might
be able to solve this. Assuming we could deploy it to ec2, then the
latency wouldn't be \*so\* awful, and most other problems could be
solved.

That said, I don't know how happy erlang would be with us configuring
its distribution via environment variables, and whether we could build
something so that people can test distribution locally.

I will start taking a look at the possibility of doing this, but don't
hold your breath.

&gt;    As Sam said, you could however solve these issues by:
&gt;    \* providing your own implementation of an `erl\_epmd` solver;
&gt;    \* and your own implementation of an `inet\_tcp\_dist`;
&gt;    \* both using as communication an HTTP module (like `mochiweb` or
&gt; `misultin`) multiplexing between the two;
&gt;
&gt;    But this road is very hard... If interested you could read one of
&gt; my posts to the Erlang list exactly about this topic, but which
&gt; remained unanswered...
&gt;      http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2011-October/062004.html
&gt;
&gt;    (One ideea: use ZeroMQ for communication, but again all this goes
&gt; if the previous assertion is true.)
