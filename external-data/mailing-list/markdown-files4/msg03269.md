The fact that the other node is idle clues makes me think that the
node you're talking to is not reaching the other node. Both nodes
should be participating in the storage of the data.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I've build a cluster with two physical Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit 4GB machines
&gt; (laptop, 2 cores, 2.4GHz and desktop, 4 cores, 3.1GHz) and I am trying to
&gt; "load\_data goog.csv" (around 1500 records) from a Fast Track tutorial. It
&gt; took over 15 minutes.
&gt;
&gt; Riak installation (both from DEB package) is correct and working. Other
&gt; examples worked as shown.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Inserts are very, very slow. Maybe 1 insert in 2 secs??? Memory used
&gt; around 50%. Network is wired.
&gt; 2. All inserts go to the local node that I'm working on, the other node is
&gt; idle.
&gt;
&gt; I attached status for both nodes and bucket properties.
&gt;
&gt; Is it a bug, or have I made a bug? :-)
&gt;
&gt; Thank for any ideas...
