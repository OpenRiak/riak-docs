&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your reply.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that write\_once is going to work for us as we have to
&gt; periodically update the data (although if we remove the data before
&gt; re-inserting it, would that work?)
&gt; 
&gt; Why does read-before-write slow down new writes so much?

Interesting. What version of riak is this, please?

&gt; 
&gt; Some new information we've found - it seems that if we write the data and
&gt; then update it, we get fast speeds too. It's just the initial write of the
&gt; data that is slow.
&gt; 
&gt; So why is writing sequential keys so much slower than updating them or
&gt; writing non-sequential keys?
