Hi Martin,

Thank you for sharing detailed information.

&gt; [snip]

I also tried your URL and found sudden stop at MB boundary.
Could you please add some information:

- Riak version
- Riak CS version
- app.config and vm.args of Riak
- app.config and vm.args of Riak CS
- log of Riak and Riak CS if there is output around download

# If log files are large, please send them to me (sh...@basho.com).

&gt; I have another problem that might or might not be related, and is described 
&gt; much easier:
&gt; s3cmd ls s3://abc
&gt; WARNING: Retrying failed request: /?delimiter=/ ('')

Log might be useful also for this issue.

&gt; One remaining question:
&gt; root@riak3:~# riak-admin diag
&gt; ...
&gt; ["sh: 1: exec: sysctl: not found"],

It may be better to separate this from above ones ;)
Would you file this issue at https://github.com/basho/riak/issues ?

Regards,
Shino
