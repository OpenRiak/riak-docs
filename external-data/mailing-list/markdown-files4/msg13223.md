&gt;
&gt; Can you please try running the following command from within the dev
&gt; directory:
&gt;
&gt; $ ./dev1/bin/riak ping
&gt;
&gt; When I run it locally using your exact configs (downloaded from
&gt; pastebin), I see:
&gt;
&gt; $ ./dev1/bin/riak ping
&gt; Node 'dev1@127.0.0.1\r' not responding to pings.
&gt;
&gt; (Note the \r)
&gt;
&gt; If I start dev2 (using the config populated by Riak's `make devrel
&gt; DEVNODES=2` command), I get:
&gt;
&gt; $ ./dev2/bin/riak ping
&gt; Node 'dev2@127.0.0.1' not responding to pings.
&gt;
&gt; Can you please ensure that all carriage returns are removed from your
&gt; Riak configuration files?
&gt;
&gt;
Hector,

Apologies for the delayed response. I've been traveling internationally
over the last ten days and in my haste thought I had sent the reply, when I
actually had only written the response.

I do not have any carriage returns in my actual config file, I believe that
was added when pasting to pastebin. When I run "./dev1/bin/riak ping" I get
"pong". However, I'm running riak on ubuntu 12.10 on vagrant. And I have to
start riak with "sudo" otherwise while it does start up, it does not bind
to the configured ports.

Thanks.

-Ari
