Hey Justin/Dave,

I know you guys are busy working on various new features, is this going to
make it into the next production release? Is there a date for that? Is there
somewhere to look at your road map so I don't have to spam the list?

Thanks,
Will

&gt; &gt; Can you define what you would consider "huge" regarding # keys?
&gt;
&gt; A bit depends on the details (such as key size) but generally the
&gt; tipping point is somewhere near ten million keys per GB of RAM.
