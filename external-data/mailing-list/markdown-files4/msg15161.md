Thanks Eric - I don't see the \_yz\_vtag returned in the search result set -
so not sure how to tell that?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I have some quick (hopefully!) questions around Riak search.
&gt;
&gt; 1. I'm getting multiple documents returned in the search results for a
&gt; query - which I assume is based on the n\_val of my bucket as I tried to
&gt; change the search index to have a n\_val of 1 but got an error that it
&gt; needed to match the bucket n\_val - is this expected behaviour, i.e. will
&gt; the search return multiples based from the n\_val, and I need to code for
&gt; that?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You should only get multiple results if your values have siblings. You can
&gt; tell if they're siblings because the duplicates will have different
&gt; \_yz\_vtags.
&gt;
&gt; 2. What is best practice if we required to change an index (e.g. adding a
&gt; new indexed field) and wanted to re-generate the index for a particular
&gt; bucket?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Currently, that requires you rewriting your dataset again. However, there
&gt; is a PR in the works to allow incremental schema changes, as well as
&gt; allowing AAE to automatically update indexed documented based on schema
&gt; changes: https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/pull/427
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Jason
