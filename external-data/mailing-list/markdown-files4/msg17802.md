The process is (typically) beam.smp, though you may have multiple on your 
machine, if for example, you are connected to riak via the console, or if you 
are running administrative commands (e.g., riak-admin). For the ports (if that 
is also what you are looking for) see:

Can you tell us more about what you are trying to research?

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Currently, I need to know exactly which process occupies the network
&gt; port (OS level) and performs file IO while Riak is running (For some
&gt; research usage). I have seen tools like Erlang+drace, but it seems a
&gt; little difficult. I'm not very familiar with Erlang world, so would
&gt; you mind giving me some advice about it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you very much
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
