Thank you, that fixed the SSL problem and I was able to install the .deb
correctly, so I can get on with my experiments. There does seem to be a
problem with how configure is doing its "&gt;=" tests though.

But eventually I will want to run multiple instances on one node to play
with failover, etc. And for that I need to build from source (so says
the doc. I am not clear on why building from source gives different
results than the binary install though.)

When building from source I still get the messages about libstdc++ as it
tried to make "skerl".

==&gt; skerl (compile)
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
ERROR: cc c\_src/skein.o c\_src/skein\_api.o c\_src/skein\_block.o
c\_src/skein\_debug.o c\_src/skerl\_nifs.o -lstdc++ -shared 
-L/usr/lib/erlang/lib/erl\_interface-3.7.6/lib -lerl\_interface -lei -o
priv/skerl\_nifs.so failed with error: 1 and output:

I can see the files I think it is looking for. The last one is a link
to the second one:
/usr/lib/ure/lib/libstdc++.so.6
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.16
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
