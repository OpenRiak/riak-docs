Hi Kevin, 

If you've followed the instructions linked from the Riak Control README on 
GitHub, you should be able to just specify the path to the files you've built, 
the extension doesn't matter as long as the files are armored ASCII.

{certfile, "/path/to/crt/file"}, 
{keyfile, "/path/to/key/file"}


Let me know if that doesn't work for you.

- Chris

&gt; Thank you.
