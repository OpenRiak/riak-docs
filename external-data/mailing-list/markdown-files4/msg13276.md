The allowable inputs to an MR map phase include a list of bucket key pairs.
If you know your keys in advance the problem is solved.

Can you describe a bit more about how you're using MR? Is this an ad hoc
query? A predictable report? Time based?

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I have a question concerning map-reduce. I have two buckets with counters
&gt; enabled that have similar keys to track two different metrics. At the
&gt; moment in order to combine these two datasets together I have to make 2
&gt; different map-reduce queries and combine the data within the client. I'm
&gt; wondering if/how it might be possible to combine both of these queries into
&gt; one. I'm thinking that Links are a possibility, but I'm not sure if it
&gt; would or how viable a solution it would be.
&gt;
&gt; Any and all advice is welcomed.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Bryce
