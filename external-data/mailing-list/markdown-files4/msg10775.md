I think an short and explicit discussion of using sequential GETs would be
good to add to the docs in [1]. It'll be helpful to put the alternate
option in the reader's head so they can evaluate as they're going through
the article.

Cheers

&gt; I want to follow up on the recent "Map phase timeout" thread [2]. In part
&gt; out of curiosity and in part as a documentation clean up... Should the
&gt; documentation at [1] be changed? Specifically, the docs say MR should be
&gt; used:
&gt;
&gt; - \*When you know the set of objects you want to MapReduce over (the
&gt; bucket-key pairs) \*(emphasis added)
&gt; - When you want to return actual objects or pieces of the object â€“ not
&gt; just the keys, as do Search & Secondary Indexes
&gt; - When you need utmost flexibility in querying your data. MapReduce
&gt; gives you full access to your object and lets you pick it apart any way you
&gt; want.
&gt;
&gt; It seems to me that a lot of discussions around MR in Riak come down to
&gt; "You're close but this isn't the best use case of MapReduce in Riak." Would
&gt; it be better, for the purposes of a general discussion, to say that
&gt; MapReduce is the appropriate paradigm when you want to:
&gt;
&gt; - manipulate a large amount of data inside the Riak cluster in bulk -
&gt; e.g. read all of my sales orders and where the version is 1, perform the
&gt; changes necessary to update the order format to version 2.
&gt; - burn a lot of I/O and make your admin sad
&gt; - move data from one bucket to another
&gt; - re-write an entire bucket so all data is indexed for 2i, search, etc
&gt; - Anything where the query can be resumed with no knowledge of state
&gt; at the time the last run of the query failed.
&gt;
&gt; Are there other use cases when MR is the better approach?
