&gt; The main point of memcache is that it is distributed and the clients
&gt; automatically handle failover at any reasonably large scale. How do you
&gt; arrange that with redis?
&gt;
&gt; That's the ONE thing that we aren't totally happy about w/redis. We have
experimented w/write to one redis and use the others are read slaves, but i
wish redis had true cluster support. But then again, most of what we need
that for is why we're using riak in the first place.
