Amol,

Although a repair tool exists for eleveldb the simplest solutions is to simply 
delete the corrupted partition and run a repair job. 

1. Stop the node

2. Locate the directory you have configured for eleveldb data storage and 
delete the subdirectory 479555224749202520035584085735030365824602865664

3. Start the node

4. Follow these instructions : 
https://docs.basho.com/riak/kv/2.0.0/using/repair-recovery/repairs/#repairing-partitions

PS - Itâ€™s better to run a cluster with 5 nodes. 

Best Regards,

Bryan Hunt
