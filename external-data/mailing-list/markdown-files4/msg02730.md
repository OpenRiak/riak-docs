&gt; I personally don't like using ambiguous short names. I get that you can

&gt; self-documenting, and semantically correct. "Entry" would, in my mind, 
&gt; represent a very generic interface that defined various kinds of "Entry"s of 
&gt; things.

Likewise, I'd like to suggest RiakDoc

&gt; This feels like a Grails GORM convention. Using finders and calling save 
&gt; directly on the object you're working with. I guess it's more a matter of 
&gt; personal preference, but I'm not sure I like it as a general rule. It's not a 
&gt; very object-oriented approach, either, as it mixes concerns a little too 
&gt; much, in my mind.

I like it actually, though not surprising. Since I am using grails with riak.
All my standalone scripts are written in groovy but make use of riak java 
client.
