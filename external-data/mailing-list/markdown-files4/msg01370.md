&gt; 
&gt; So it is telling someting to me but i am not clear... Is riak search also 
&gt; routing request as load balancer does ? 
&gt; 

Like Riak KV, queries to Riak Search will invoke multiple nodes in the cluster, 
hence your load-balancing really only changes which node coordinates the query.

&gt; Any idea about above situation ? 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I want to make test via wikipedia also with million doc.. By the way is 
&gt; there any parser for wikipedia to submit riaksearch ? 
&gt; 

Riak Search's `search-cmd` tool can slurp directories of text files for insert 
into the index. There's more information on the wiki:
