Hello everybody!

I’ve riak-1.4.7.
I’ve eleveldb storage (because of 2i).
I’ve already enable riak search in all nodes.
I’ve already install the precommit hook into a bucket:
search-cmd install bucket\_name

I know that keys will be indexed after install the precommit hook.

I've already save a bucket through HTTP api:
POST
http://127.0.0.1:10018/riak/index\_bucket
Content-Type: application/json
{"key": "Value"}

dev1/bin/search-cmd search index\_bucket key:Value

And I get a found 1 result (it's ok!), now I would like to know if can I save a 
proplists and search into it?
Could anybody give me an example, please?

Thank you very much!
