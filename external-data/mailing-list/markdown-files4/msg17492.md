Hi,

We have a RIAK cluster with 5 nodes. Since few days we see that 2 of our
clusters are quickly getting high number of items in mailbox, giving
overall low performance of the cluster (even up to tenths of seconds for
processing). But 3 nodes are almost idle... We nailed down that requests
are hitting quite big objects (&gt;200kB) and we think this could be the issue.

Are you have similar experience with such processing schema? What
parameters shall we tweak to allow Riak handle these requests more quickly
and off-load nodes to rest of the cluster?

Thanks in advance,
Marcin
