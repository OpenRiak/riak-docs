Hello my Denormalizeds,

In case you’ve been beaten down by the dog days of summer, fight back by
reading about the Spark Riak Connector and the ever present mailing list
recap!

As always, let us know your thoughts: If you’re working on or speaking
about something Riak related and would like a mention, let me know. I’ll
get your talk, project or blog post in the next Riak Recap. I know a guy.
