&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; Absolutely new (and ignorant) to NoSQL solutions and to Riak (my
&gt; apologies; but extensive experience with SQL RDBMS).

&gt; 
&gt; The application should be able to write several hundreds of new
&gt; records per second, but first check if the unique key already exists.
&gt; Writing is to be done only if it is not there. If it is, the app needs
&gt; to retrieve the whole record and return it to the client and no
&gt; writing is done in this case.

Since Riak is an eventually consistent database, you will not be able to tell
with 100% certainty that a key or does not exist. If this is a \_firm 
requirement\_,
you'll need to either use another db or some external service to provide this
guarantee.
