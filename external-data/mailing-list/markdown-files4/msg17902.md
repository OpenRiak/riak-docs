IF you use leveldb, there is a function in the riak-erlang-client that gets all 
objects in a bucket, I donâ€™t know if it has been implemented in the java client 
as it was written specifically for riak-cs.

&gt; Hi ,
&gt; I am planning to use riak-client 2.2.0 with java technology.
&gt; What I understood is, If I have to fetch all records which are falling under
&gt; one bucket, I need to first fetch all keys then based on those keys I need
&gt; to fetch these values. This is going to be in two steps. And first step
&gt; seems to be very costly operation.
&gt; Just wanted to know is there any efficient way by which I can fetch all
&gt; record from the bucket in a single call ?
&gt; 
&gt; Help would be appreciated.
