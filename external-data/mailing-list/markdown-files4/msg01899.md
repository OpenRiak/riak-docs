Hello, Jérôme.

It looks like Jeremiah has already answered one of your questions, so
I'll get the other.

&gt; My other question/remark is: there does not seem to be a downloadable

There's certainly no operating system religion at work here, simply
the limited resources of a small team. A few different people in the
community have been working on Windows support, which we think is a
great idea -- we just currently don't have anyone spare to make
official windows releases, QA and benchmark those releases on various
windows systems, and so on.
