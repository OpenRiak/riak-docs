Hello,

I need to decide what database we will choose for our project. Certainly, we 
need only 2 physical nodes (active-standby). Riak is good for us, becase it is 
Erlang-based, as our project. But is's known that riak cluster should have at 
least five nodes. I have some problems with my cluster, same as in this E-mail: 
http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2012-March/007988.html
Could you cleraly explain, please, is it possible to tune riak to work 
correctly with only 2 physical nodes, or we need to choose another DBMS?

Dmitry
