Your search/luwak tests are failing, presumably because those options
are not enabled in your Riak installation. You can disable them in the
test suite by doing:

$ SKIP\_SEARCH=1 SKIP\_LUWAK=1 python setup.py test

You also seem to be running into a problem with leftover keys in one
of the test buckets. That problem is fixed by pull request #67, which
has not been merged :-( ... if you grab that fix, then a couple of
your errors will go away.

I see some additional failures based on extra siblings... I don't know
what is happening there.

Cheers,

&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt;
&gt; I cannot get the test suite in the python client to run, I have tried
&gt; on Arch Linux on my notebook and then on an Ubunty Natty system on EC2
&gt; with riak 1.0.0:
&gt;
&gt; wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-1.0.0/riak\_1.0.0-1\_amd64.deb
&gt; sudo dpkg -i riak\_1.0.0-1\_amd64.deb
&gt; sudo /etc/init.d/riak start
&gt;
&gt; sudo apt-get install python-protobuf
&gt; git clone git://github.com/basho/riak-python-client.git
&gt;
&gt; virtualenv riak
&gt; . riak/bin/activate
&gt; cd riak-python-client
&gt; python setup.py install
&gt; python setup.py test
&gt;
&gt; and I get:
&gt; FAILED (failures=6, errors=19)
&gt;
&gt; The full test output can be found at:
&gt; http://www.honzakral.com/riak\_python\_test.out
&gt;
&gt; If anybody can point out what I did wrong or how to make the tests
&gt; work I would be most grateful.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
