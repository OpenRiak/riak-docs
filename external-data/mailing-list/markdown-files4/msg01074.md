&gt; This is a feature we've definitely thought about. We have it on our roadmap 
&gt; of improvements but I can't say when this feature will appear in Riak. We are 
&gt; committed to making MapReduce more useful and usable for everyone and 
&gt; allowing external processes to participate in MapReduce jobs is a great way 
&gt; to achieve both of those goals.

That sounds great. Thanks Kevin.
