Hi, Ali. I have a couple of answers, depending on the intent of your question.

The first answer, is that the code actually handling HTTP connections
has already been broken out: that's what Riak uses webmachine and
mochiweb for.

The second answer is that we don't intend to break out any more of the
HTTP interface code. The things that the riak\_kv\_wm\_\* resources do
are so closely related to how riak\_kv functions, that we don't think
it really makes sense to separate them.
