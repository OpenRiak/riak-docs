Hi Vladimir,

Yes, deleting an object is actually more expensive than just marking it 
deleted. What happens is that Riak will delete it in two steps, first it 
writes a tombstone record for the key, and then some time later it does the 
real delete.

When you do a delete, riak will return success as soon as it has saved the 
tombstone record. It then installs a timer and runs a "real delete" later. 
Thus, if you delete \*a lot\* of objects, then you will have a bunch of pending 
"real deletes".

If you can let them expire that would be the most efficient way to get rid of 
them. Bitcask and HanoiDB supports expiry.

HI all,

Is deleting a key more expensive operation then just marking it as deleted?

I noticed that delete a bunch of keys is quite expensive. All CPUs are fully 
utilized.

I can imagine that I can mark the key first and delete them some time later, 
e.q. not in rush hours.
What is actually the best way from your point of view to delete a key/keys?

Thanks in advance!
Vladimir
