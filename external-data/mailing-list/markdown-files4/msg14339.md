Your error message shows that CI expects a a minimum version of 2.0.0.640 for 
protobuf and you’re using version 2.0.0.602.

The short answer is to update protobuf-net to a version greater than or equal 
to the required one. See here: http://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net/ it’s 
up to version 2.0.0.668. Get latest on this library and it should be fine.

The reason there’s a minimum version number specified is to make sure that CI 
doesn’t break with out of date libs. We’d rather have compiler errors than 
runtime errors or data corruption issues.

Cheers.
OJ

Hello, everyone.

Pay attention, there's lots of version numbers below :-)

Riak: 1.4.8-0-g7545390
Hosting OS:  CentOS 6.5
IDE:  Monodevelop 4.2.3
CorrugatedIron:  1.4.2 (obtained through the Monodevelop Nuget plugin)

I've written a very simple C# console program to test CorrugatedIron -&gt; Riak 
connectivity but when I try to build it I get an error message indicating that 
the version of protobuf-net being referenced by CorrugatedIron (2.0.0.640) is 
higher than the version that was imported with  CorrugatedIron (2.0.0.602).  
Has anyone else come across this problem?  Any ideas how to fix it?

Full error message:  Error CS1705: Assembly `CorrugatedIron, Version=1.4.2.0, 
Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=fb1ec7de601674df' references `protobuf-net, 
Version=2.0.0.640, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=257b51d87d2e4d67' which has 
a higher version number than imported assembly `protobuf-net, 
Version=2.0.0.602, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=257b51d87d2e4d67' (CS1705) 
(CI\_Riak\_test)

Sorry if this is a noob question but I'm still finding my way with a) CentOS, 
b) Riak, c) Monodevelop, d) C# ... so I need all the help I can get!

Cheers,

Dave
