&gt; I'd love to provide you with more information, but don't have much
&gt; time to go digging around. The workaround is, well, a workaround, but
&gt; it let us move on. I'll keep a special eye on this until it happens
&gt; again, and let's definitely keep each other posted.
&gt;
&gt;
Even in 0.14.2 I find it hard to believe the index is dropping 5% of the
data on the floor. It's entirely possible, but just not the first, or
second or third thing I would expect.

Please keep me posted. I'll keep this incident in the back of my head when
looking at Search code.
