s/building FreeBSD on Riak/building Riak on FreeBSD/

Emails need a wiki feature ;-)

If no-one else steps forward, I'll attempt a FreeBSD build this weekend.
FreeBSD used to be my primary server OS (until Ubuntu Server won me over),
so I've got some familiarity there.\*

&gt; Any brave souls who've done this successfully off of the latest
&gt; release want to take a stab at it and update the newly-created Wiki
&gt; issue accordingly [1].
