Hi Kota,
I was installing these on fresh 14.04 VMs, so I don't know how I could have
had stale apt-cache info re Stanchion, but still had up to date riak-cs
package info.
Oh well, if you couldn't reproduce it, never mind. Thanks for trying.

Cheers
Toby

&gt; I tried to reproduce your problem in my clean ubuntu 14.04 which is a
&gt; fresh docker image, but failed. No recommendation was made. Maybe state of
&gt; your apt repository or something is stale?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Kota,
&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm installing Riak CS upon Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty), and was doing this by
&gt;&gt; &gt; following the instructions to add the packagecloud.io Apt repository.
&gt;&gt; &gt; However that repository contains stanchion 1.5 rather than 2.0. (It
&gt;&gt; does,
&gt;&gt; &gt; however, contain Riak CS 2.0.1)
