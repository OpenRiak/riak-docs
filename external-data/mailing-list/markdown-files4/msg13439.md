Any comment on that approach?

http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/01/14/back-that-nosql-up/

Snippet:
HyperDex uses HyperLevelDB as its storage backend, which, in turn,
constructs an LSM-tree on disk. The majority of data stored within
HyperLevelDB is stored within immutable .sst files. Once written, these
files are never overwritten. The backup feature within HyperDex can extract
a snapshot of these files via an instantenous hard link in the filesystem.
This state, once snapshotted so efficiently, can then be transferred
elsewhere at will. At the cluster level, backups pause writes for a short
period of time while the HyperDex daemons take their individual snaphsots.
Because individual snapshots are efficient, the pause generally takes less
than a second.

Regards
Daniel
