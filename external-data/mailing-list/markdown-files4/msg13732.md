Very cool indeed,

unfortunately, I believe the parent/child relationship is an insert time
functionality, which wouldn't be compatible with the way riak keys get
indexed, maybe someone from @basho can chime in on if its possible to use
this feature, it might require a separate extractor in yokozuna.

&gt; Wow; that looks like a great new feature;
&gt; http://blog.griddynamics.com/2013/09/solr-block-join-support.html is
&gt; useful
&gt;
&gt; Also, it's in SOLR since 4.5 (which yokozuna has) :D
