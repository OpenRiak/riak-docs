To add some further ammo to this, from an user / non-Basho perspective...

As someone who makes heavy use of OS packaging (in our case, RPMs on EL-like 
distros), I would like to see the following continue:

 \* Erlang contained within the Riak package to avoid conflicts with 
other Erlang apps[1] and to ensure the versions of Riak &lt;-&gt; Erlang are matched 
as best possible.

 \* A single Riak RPM/package; I see no benefit in maintaining separate 
packages for each component of Riak, only extra effort required for users and 
packagers.

[1] I'm aware it's not recommended to run multiple Erlang apps on the same 
host, but sometimes this is necessary. A shared Erlang package would make this 
even more troublesome than it currently is.


Regards,
Tom
