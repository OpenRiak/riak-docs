Hi,

It looks like I'm running into this bug quite often.

What is the release date schedule for the next Riak release that would
include this fix?

Cheers,

Lexual.

&gt; Hi, David. The clues are here:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; '{"phase":0,"error":"[timeout]","input":"{&lt;&lt;\\"impressions\\"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;\\"0034fad8-8216-4e12-95e9-abcf4af498ca:cid6587015966:agid5748040653:
&gt; 2012112805:SG\\"&gt;&gt;}","type":"forward\_preflist","stack":"[]"}'
&gt;
&gt; The query encountered a timeout error in the first phase. The
&gt; 'forward\_preflist' type is an unfortunate problem with Riak 1.2, where
&gt; a key that was not found (I'm guessing at the meaning of your
&gt; "nokeypy" module name) would attempt to use a forwarding mechanism
&gt; that would fail if the input list was large enough to fill pipe
&gt; processing queues in a preflist:

&gt;
&gt; This issue has been fixed on master, and will be part of the 1.3 release.
