From http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/rolling-upgrades/ it looks 
like you should upgrade to 1.3.2 and then 1.4.1

Depending on how badly you need the extra capacity, it would probably be better 
to start by upgrading all nodes and then adding the new one.

&gt; Hi riak peoples,
&gt; I'm in the process of adding a new node to a aging (1 node) cluster. I would 
&gt; like to know what would be the prefered incrementing upgrade to get all my 
&gt; nodes on the latest riak version. The best scenario would also have the 
&gt; least downtime. The old node is at riak version 1.2.1.
&gt; 
&gt; My actual plan is:
&gt; 
&gt; - install riak 1.4.1 on the new node
&gt; - add the new 1.4.1 node to the old 1.2.1 cluster.
&gt; - bring the 1.2.1 node offline
&gt; - upgrade the 1.2.1 node to 1.4.1
&gt; - put the upgraded node back online
&gt; 
&gt; will this work?
&gt; thanks!
