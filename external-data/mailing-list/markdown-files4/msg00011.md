Because reduce functions can be run multiple times, yes, your best bet is to 
keep track of the total and the count and then do the final average on the 
client side.

&gt; Assuming I have keys in one bucket, if I have a reduce function that 
&gt; calculates an average (of some attribute of each key), and I want to use 
&gt; chunking, does each node return the average of all values reduced on that 
&gt; node independently? If so, I really need the node to emit sum and count so I 
&gt; can do the final average calculation in PHP (or whichever language) once I 
&gt; have the total sum and count of items.
&gt; 
&gt; Or, since I'm calculating a value from a single bucket of keys, will each 
&gt; node that contains the bucket return the same value of the reduce function 
&gt; because each node has the same (complete set) of data?

&gt; Thanks again for your patience with a complete noob.
