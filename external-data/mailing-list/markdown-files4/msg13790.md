Hi Matthew,

I believe 60 seconds is the default timeout in the client, so it is
possible the `busy\_dist\_port` issues have caused a timeout and that the
automatic retry then has succeeded.

A small +zdbbl value will cause the internal buffers to fill up and result
in `busy\_dist\_port` messages, which will cause performance problems. I
would recommend setting +zdbbl to 16384 (16MB) or 32768 (32MB) and verify
that you stop seeing busy\_dist\_post messages in the logs. If problems
persist it may be required to set it even higher.

It is also important to note that `busy\_dist\_port` messages can be caused
by individual large objects even if +zdbbl is set to a reasonably large
value as outlined above. In Riak 1.4.8, logging of large objects has been
introduced, which will allow you to identify large objects that could cause
problems by going through the logs. You can also track large objects by
trending the `node\_get\_fsm\_objsize\_100` statistic.

Best regards,

Christian

&gt; Hi everyone, we are running Riak 1.4.1 on RHEL 6.2 using bitcask. We are
&gt; using protobufs with the Java client, and our binary objects are typically
&gt; a few hundred KB in size. I have noticed a persistent anomaly with riak
&gt; reads and writes. It seems like often, maybe 0.5% of the time, writing to
&gt; Riak takes 60 seconds longer than it should. Here is a prime example I just
&gt; trimmed from a log file (see the last time entry below).
&gt;
&gt; This is not bitcask merge related because it happens before any of the
&gt; bitcask slabs are large enough to merge. I am seeing lots of busy\_dist\_port
&gt; messages in the Riak logs. One unique setting is that we have a small zdbbl
&gt; setting of 128K because this seemed to prevent congestive collapse of
&gt; throughput at high sustained loads. I believe that this 60 second timeout
&gt; persisted across the various zdbbl settings we tried. Also we see this
&gt; occasional 60 second delay on both VMs and real server hardware.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know where this 60 second delay comes from?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
