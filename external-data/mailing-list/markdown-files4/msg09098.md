This is in /usr/local/Cellar/riak/1.1.2-x86\_64/libexec/etc/app.config, which I 
assume is the config for brew Riak.

 %% Riak Search Config
 {riak\_search, [
 %% To enable Search functionality set this 'true'.
 {enabled, true}
 ]},

&gt; I have a question about Riak search. 
&gt; 
&gt; I installed Riak from brew. I enabled search shortly after. And to date, I 
&gt; have been able to search without issues. (Specifically, I am using Ripple, 
&gt; and was previously able to find things in stored keys in individual records.)
&gt; 
&gt; I deleted my database today using rm -rf on the data directory. I stopped 
&gt; Riak before the delete, and restarted after recreating that directory with 
&gt; mkdir. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I cannot search. 
&gt; 
&gt; As an aside, a colleague installed Riak from brew and has not been able to 
&gt; search ever, so we test against my machine, or did, until I broke search.
&gt; 
&gt; What do he and I need to do to enable search again? Configure something? 
&gt; Sacrifice a goat?
&gt; 
&gt; Please help!!!
