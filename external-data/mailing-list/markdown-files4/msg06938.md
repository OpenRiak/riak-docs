This is great Shuhao! 

I've had problems using the python client using multiple threads with protocol 
buffers. The exact same multithreaded code works fine with http protocol. So, 
any attention you can give to the pbc transport would be hugely appreciated.

Good luck! Can't wait to give your new client a test drive.

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been working with riak and python for the past couple of months, and I'm 
&gt; at the point where I'm ready to completely reimplement riak-python-client. 
&gt; So.. I did/started. The project is hosted on github and under the same apache 
&gt; 2 license as the original client.
&gt; 
&gt; https://github.com/ultimatebuster/riak-python-client2
&gt; 
&gt; Couple of key highlights right now:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. 2 layers of API, a very basic layer (Transports), which handles 
&gt; communicating with the server, and a high level API, which consists of 
&gt; Bucket, Object, and so on.
&gt; 2. Eliminated things like `set\_` and `get\_`. Made them just variables where 
&gt; possible
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still taking suggestions for how to reimplement RiakObject (now called 
&gt; RObject). Any feedback will be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Shuhao
