Hi,
Searching for riak roles on Ansible Galaxy brings up this one:
https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles/777

However this is listed as only supporting RHEL 6 and Ubuntu 12.04.

Ubuntu 14.04 is the current long-term-support version, and what we're
deploying stuff to; it'd be great if the Ansible roles available could
support it too.

Cheers,
Toby
