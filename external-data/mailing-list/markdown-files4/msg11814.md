Newbie with Riak, and looking at the java client.

Specifically, I've been digging into the domain mapping apis. Looking into the 
code, it appears to me that, if I'm using links a bunch or even secondary 
indexes, that I could lose some data during the conflict resolution phase. I 
see where links and other relevant user data gets cached during the conversion 
phase from the fetch and then patched back in during the conversion phase for 
the store. However, it doesn't look like you have the opportunity during the 
resolution phase to merge metadata. Should I focus on using the raw client, or 
am I missing something?

Thanks!

Paul
