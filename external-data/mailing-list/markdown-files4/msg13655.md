I strongly recommend sticking with the 1.4 series until 2.0 is formally 
released.

The 2.0 features are great, but making certain that upgrades will go smoothly 
is a top priority for every major release of Riak, and this will be no 
exception. You can upgrade when the time is right for your needs. (And I don’t 
want to speak for the engineering team, but I’d wager that no one is placing a 
great deal of emphasis on testing upgrades from 2.0 pre-releases to 2.0 itself.)

With regard to the Python client: it does not yet support 2.0 features, but 
that should change soon. It’s under active development.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I've a big question... if you have to go in production in the next two
&gt; months (about at the half/end of April) you use Riak 1.4 or 2.0 pre-x
&gt; ???
&gt; How hard will it be to upgrade from 1.4 to 2.0?
&gt; At the moment I don't need new features (crdt) of 2.0 version. Maybe
&gt; only new simpler configuration will be useful.
&gt; More important: I'm using the python client: does it work with 2.0?
&gt; Thanks
