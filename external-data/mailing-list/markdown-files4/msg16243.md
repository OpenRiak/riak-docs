Hey Alex,

The best place to start on troubleshooting behaviors like the one you
saw is to run `riak-debug`, which is in `/bin`. There's a great deal
of data in there which you could upload to a Gist [1] and share with
us.

&gt; Then I deleted the AEE folders within "anti\_entropy" and "yz\_anti\_entropy"
&gt; and is working fine again... I would like to know the reason for that : )
