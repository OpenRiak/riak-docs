Each sibling has it's own last-modified date, which you should be able to use 
to sort them when you get them back. 

However, I'd suggest the following: if they're siblings, they were created from 
concurrent edits. Thus, create a merge function that is entirely deterministic 
without using the timestamp. This should save you from any clock skew issues, 
and also from the fact that an edit may not have been performed with the most 
up-to-date information.

I guess people can't wait for our CRDTs to launch.

&gt; Yes, exactly that's what I'm working on. By knowing which sibling is
&gt; the oldest and which is the newest it seems like I can usually figure
&gt; out how to marge/apply the modifications. Things like Player profiles,
&gt; friends lists, etc.

&gt; &gt; There's no guarantee of return order as far as I know. Since you can't count

&gt; &gt; Are you trying to determine which data modifications to apply from multiple
&gt; &gt; siblings?
