Sorry about the lack of a source package, that was my oversight. I just
uploaded one to downloads.basho.com.

Thanks for the feedback,
-Jared

&gt; &gt;&gt; I just checked out the link (provided below) and did not find a
&gt; &gt;&gt; \*source\* distribution. Could you work that into the distribution?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, there should be one of those -- will ping Jared.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; In my particular situation, I'm working on Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) and
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ubuntu 9.x. I can manage building if given a source distro, but would
&gt; &gt;&gt; certainly prefer pre-built packages (32-bit on both platforms).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is a i386 .deb which may work on ubuntu9; would be curious to
&gt; &gt; know if it does. :)
&gt;
&gt; I'm away [on vacation] from my ubuntu systems right now, but will try
&gt; it late next week and provide feedback.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;...
&gt; &gt;&gt; I had a one-line change for one of those pages last week, and sent
&gt; &gt;&gt; that to this mailing list (and it was promptly fixed; yay!). What is
&gt; &gt;&gt; the recommended "best" process for feedback? Should we all fork the
&gt; &gt;&gt; website, make changes, and send pull requests? Send mail here? File
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Pull requests are easiest from a procedural standpoint.
&gt;
&gt; Will do.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
