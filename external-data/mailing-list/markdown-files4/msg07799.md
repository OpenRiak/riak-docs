Hi Basho,

We have a running cluster of 5 nodes which accidentally was configured with
a default setting
"{ ring\_creation\_size: 64 }".

As suggested in documentation we cannot scale this cluster more than 6
machines,
so the only option is to migrate to a new cluster with a
larger ring\_creation\_size value.

What is the best way to perform the migration?! And btw why 64 is still
the default value?!

Thanks,
 -Matthew
