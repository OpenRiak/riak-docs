Hey Kyle,

&gt; I have an experimental Riak build for Windows... There's still some

&gt; share my Windows binaries (once they are ready for public

&gt;
&gt;

Definitely share those binaries once you think they are ready for the
spotlight. There are numerous parties who are interested in building
Riak on Windows and, as Justin pointed out above, Basho's resources
are a bit constrained at the moment, so any help we (and the
community) could get in this respect would be much appreciated.

Thanks,

Mark
