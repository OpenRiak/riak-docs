Hi Greg,

Two questions:

1. Was this count normally correct \_before\_ upgrading to 14.2?

2. Have you performed a direct delete (e.g. via curl) of any keys under your
\_rsid\_ bucket?

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; we recently upgraded to riak-search 0.14.2 and it seems that the numFound
&gt; value returned from SOLR searches is no longer correct.
&gt;
&gt; In one particular search, there are actually 22 results. If I set start =
&gt; 30 and count = 10, I get 0 results as expected. However, no matter what I
&gt; set those to, numFound comes back as 114.
&gt;
&gt; I thought numFound was supposed to return the number of matched documents,
&gt; disregarding start and count. Am I misunderstanding something or is this a
&gt; bug?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
