Hi, Joel. Thanks for your input!

&gt; [re bitcask and in-memory data]

&gt; I'm sure it's probably already been considered, but just in case...
&gt; bloom filters could be an alternative to the requirement of keeping
&gt; \*all\* the keys in memory. I don't know if this would necessarily fit
&gt; with the usage of this in-memory key/metadata data structure though.

We are exploring ways to keep bitcask's overall performance profile
while relaxing the memory requirement a bit, though we have not yet
determined how to do so.

Bloom filters can be incredibly handy, but wouldn't (alone) solve this
problem as we use the in-memory hash table to tell bitcask the
location of the stored value in terms of file and offset.
