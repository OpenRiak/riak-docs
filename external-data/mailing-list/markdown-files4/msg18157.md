&gt; Normally when you get siblings, it is because you have written a value
&gt; with an out-of-date vclock. But since this is the first write, there
&gt; is no vclock. Could someone shed some light on this for me?
&gt;
&gt; It is worth to mention that the it took 3 seconds for Riak to deliver
&gt; the response, so it is possible there was some kind of network issue
&gt; at the time.
&gt;
&gt; Here are some details about my setup:
&gt; Number of nodes: 8.
&gt; n\_val: 5
&gt; write options: pw: 3 (quorum), return\_body
&gt;

Hi Daniel,

Please let me know if all nodes in this cluster were set up completely
fresh, with empty backend directories, or if any of them had been used
before for a Riak installation. If the latter is the case, it may be that
the key in question had already been used once before. Cluster nodes pick
up data from pre-existing backends.

How do you access the key for read and write operations?

Kind Regards,

Magnus
