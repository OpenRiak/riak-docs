Hey Matt,

Thanks for clarifying the situation. Yes, I’m working on auto-reloading and 
re-syncing data along with changes to schemas; it’ll be in a future release. 
Currently, you can add fields to the schema, for example, for new sets of data, 
and reload the index if you `riak attach` into one of the running nodes and 
reload the index across the cluster (based on 
https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/pull/260 
), e.g. 
https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/issues/130#issuecomment-43802826 
.

&gt; Just discovered this on GitHub https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/issues/130 
&gt; . Looks like auto-reloading is 
&gt; a work in progress.

&gt; Not getting any errors... but I did notice something interesting after 
&gt; deleting the nodes on my system and then reconfiguring them. 
&gt; 
&gt; If the first time I set up a schema I add the multivalued field in question, 
&gt; everything works. If I then change the schema and then update it over HTTP, 
&gt; the changes do not take affect. 
&gt; 
&gt; For example, when I reconfigured the nodes on my system I added kept the 
&gt; multivalued "groups" field I mentioned above. I then added some users and was 
&gt; able to successfully retrieve them using q=groups:\* or something more 
&gt; specific. I then changed the schema from "groups" to "groups.id 
&gt; " and PUT it on the server successfully (a subsequent GET 
&gt; returned the new schema). I also updated the users so that the "groups" array 
&gt; was changed to an array of JSON objects, each with an "id" field that would 
&gt; match the "groups.id " field in the schema. I then tried 
&gt; to query the users using q=groups.id:\*. This failed. 
&gt; 
&gt; Do changed to the schema not cause the solr indexes to update? 
&gt; 
&gt; PS: I dug around in $RIAK/data/yz/user/conf and noticed a user.xml file. The 
&gt; file held the ORIGINAL schema, not the updated one.

&gt; Hello Matt,
&gt; 
&gt; Are you receiving any indexing errors in your logs (check the Solr logs as 
&gt; well)? To be sure, I just wrote a test (using our erlang pb api, 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/pull/474/files#diff-5d0015658ff90b94cb1a00329ffafe00R251
&gt; 
&gt; )
&gt; using a custom schema, and I didn’t run into any troubles; I also checked 
&gt; via the http api. If you have the required \_yz\* fields, you should get those 
&gt; back with the document. If you want the groups items themselves, you’d have 
&gt; to make `stored` true.

&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have a quick question about a search schema that would index an array of 
&gt;&gt; strings in a JSON object. I am storing user data in JSON that looks 
&gt;&gt; something like this:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; {
&gt;&gt; "name" : "John Smith",
&gt;&gt; "email" : "jsm...@gmail.com ",
&gt;&gt; "groups" : [
&gt;&gt; "3304cf79",
&gt;&gt; "abe155cf"
&gt;&gt; ]
&gt;&gt; }
&gt;&gt; The custom schema I use for users includes this field entry: 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; multiValued="true"/&gt;
&gt;&gt; I also have the following field type entry: 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I assumed that these entries would allow me to search for users using a 
&gt;&gt; query like: 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; curl $RIAK/search/query/user?wt=json&q=groups:3304cf79
&gt;&gt; But no docs are returned. I'm almost certain I have an issue with my schema. 
&gt;&gt; How can I query users by string entries in the "groups" array?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thank you, 
&gt;&gt; Matt.
