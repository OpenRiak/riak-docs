&gt; two questions jump out right away
&gt; 
&gt; 1: how do you fetch linked records using the API? and how do you setup
&gt; link for records?

I didn't add the m/r or link walking stuff yet, will do soon and post a link, 
it would be something like it is now, a builder and an execute/submit method to 
run the job. The result would be Java types and not tied to the the Crockford 
JSON lib.

&gt; 
&gt; 2: it's not obvious from reading the code how to set the r and w value
&gt; during read and write. is it
&gt; using the rw() method?

Ah, well I guess it is not clear enough. on a Fetch you'd set the r()[1], on a 
Store you'd set the w()[2] and dw()[3] and on a delete you'd set the dw()[4] 
(much like now). An example usage is here[5]. 

Was using an actual type (like FetchCAP, StoreCAP and DeleteCAP) a better 
option, do you think?

Thanks for the comments, I'll see what I can do to make it clearer.
