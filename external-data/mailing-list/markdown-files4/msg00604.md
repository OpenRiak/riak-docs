Afternoon, Evening, Morning to all -

For today's recap - an updated Java Client, a Riak Video (no, it's
not a Riak Music Video), Riak at the upcoming Velocity Conference, and
a Gist about embedding Riak.

Enjoy,

Mark

Riak Recap for 6/14


1) @kevsmith pushed out the 0.11 version of the Riak Java Client

Get it here ---&gt;
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/com/basho/riak/riak-client/0.11.0/

2) The organizers at Red Dirt Ruby published a video of Sean Cribb's
Riak Workshop from last month. This one is long but well worth it.

Grab some hot cocoa, set aside a few hours, and click here ---&gt;

3) Distributed Systems expert Benjamin Black will be giving a lengthy
Riak Workshop at the upcoming velocity conference in Santa Clara, CA.
If you're in the area and heading to the conference, this is not to be
missed.

4) @dysinger let it leak that he is working on a Clojure/Protocol
Buffers Client for Riak. (Type faster, Tim!)

5) asabil, seancribbs and hermulen had a worthwhile conversation about
embedding Riak into applications.
