Hi All,

Is there any way i can retrieve from a bucket the keys that last
change N minutes ago for example.
If possible cis there a way to do it with riak-python-client?

Or the only way is to add a timestamp index in the bucket and update in
case of changes, so that i will be able to query that index.

Thanks
