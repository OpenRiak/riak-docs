&gt; Hello,
&gt; I am working for a non-profit where members of the organization have a need 
&gt; to store historical data for record purposes. These historical data are video 
&gt; interviews, magazines (pdfs), audio recordings etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; Watching Riak CS Build Your Own Cloud Storage by Pavan Venkatesh on youtube 
&gt; it looks like Riak CS can handle our need. The question now is, what is 
&gt; available opensource apps that use Riak cs as its backend and gives nice ui 
&gt; like dropbox or at least close to it?

We don’t officially support a graphical interface for RIak CS, however, it 
appears that I wrote one back in 2012 in Rails.

I’m not sure if the code even works, but it might provide a starting place to 
build on.
