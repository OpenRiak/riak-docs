Excellent answer; thank you.

I imagine the unavailability I see will depend strongly on the speed of read 
repairs. Since I have quite a lot of data, I imagine that they might be quite 
slow, but I probably can't say more than that without real measurements.

A related question. You say that if my n\_val is 3, some data may reside only on 
2 physical nodes. Ignoring failures, might some of it of reside on just one 
node?

Cheers,
John
