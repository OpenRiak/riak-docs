Toby,

While there is mention of it on the riak-admin page [1], in the upcoming
2.0 release `riak-admin backup` has been deprecated. The documentation you
linked contains the suggested ways for backing up your cluster at this
time. There are many ongoing discussions about providing a first-class
backup solution as part of riak(-admin) again but, right now, I do not have
many more details on how it would work or when it will be available.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; The documentation here, apparently the latest, doesn't appear to
&gt; mention the riak-admin backup command at all, nor is it mentioned on
&gt; the command-line tools page for riak-admin.

&gt;
&gt; Is the command suitable for use yet? It'll simplify backups greatly if so.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
