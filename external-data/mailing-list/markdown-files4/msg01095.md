There looks like there are some strange things happening in the logs with the 
ring as well as timeouts. I would be curious how long the process takes to die 
if you were just to run a stop instead of a restart. Did you at one time 
change the name of this node? 

One thing that might be interesting to try is to stop the server, make a copy 
of your data directory, remove all the data in the data directory, and try to 
start and stop the node and see if it works more reliably.

&gt; Over the last few weeks I've been finding it harder and harder to start

&gt; /etc/init.d/riak restart but it's got to the stage where I have to run
&gt; it four or five times. I should clarify here that when I say "harder to
&gt; start" it does start but as soon as I try to do anything it fails.
