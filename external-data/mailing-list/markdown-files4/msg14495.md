You're very perceptive! That tag is not a typo, but nothing more has been 
published, yet. If I were a betting man, I'd say something is bound to happen 
at some date in the future.

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I've been kind of holding off development for a bit while the Basho team puts 
&gt; the polish on 2.0 - and then I saw a tag - 2.0.0rc1 - in Github from 3 days 
&gt; ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Has riak 2.0 quietly moved in to RC mode? And if so, are we well in to 
&gt; feature freeze now?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it OK that I'm posting this to the mailing list?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
