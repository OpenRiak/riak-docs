Does the name in vm.args provided for a node in the cluster matter from one
run of the service to the next? In other words, could I:

 1. name the node 'x' in vm.args
 2. start the service
 3. stop the service
 4. rename the node 'y' in vm.args
 5. start the service again


I would like to dynamically assign the name prior to starting the service,
but if it must remain the same for the life of the node then this will not
work (obviously).
