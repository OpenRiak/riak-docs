Hi Kathleen, 

Deleting the ring and data directories after running 'riak stop' will wipe the 
node of all state and data. By default, the backend data and ring directories 
are within the riak data directory(noted in app.config). Running and "rm -rf 
/path/to/data/dir" once the node has been stopped will do the trick.

Let me know if you have questions.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am experimenting with riak cluster. I set it up with a three nodes with 
&gt; default config values. But would like to change some of the values. I read 
&gt; riak doc, which mentions that configs should be set up before cluster is 
&gt; running. So I tried to ‘undo’ the cluster. Riak-admin cluster leave only 
&gt; worked up to 2 nodes. Essentially the cluster is still running. How do I 
&gt; start a new cluster from scratch?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
