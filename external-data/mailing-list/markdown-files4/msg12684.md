How many nodes are you running? You should aim for around 8-16 vnodes per 
server (must be a power of 2). So if you're running 5 nodes, you should be fine 
with 4GB since it'll be approx 12 vnodes per. If you're only running on 1 
server, you'll be running 64 vnodes on that single server (which is too many), 
in which case 4GB is RAM is not near enough.

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I installed riak v1.4.2 on ubuntu12.04(64bit, 4G RAM) with apt-get, run it 
&gt; with default app.conf but change the backend to leveldb, and test it with 
&gt; https://github.com/tpjg/goriakpbc . 
&gt; 
&gt; Just keep putting (key, value) to an bucket, the memory always increasing, 
&gt; and in the end it crashed, as it cannot allocate memory. 
&gt; 
&gt; Should i change the configuration or other?
