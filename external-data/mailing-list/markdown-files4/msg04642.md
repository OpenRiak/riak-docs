Riak Recap for September 7 - 8
=======================

1) We added two more production users to the (newly-reorganized!) Riak Wiki.

\* Bump ---&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/Who-is-Using-Riak.html#bump (h/t Will Moss)
\* SEOmoz ---&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/Who-is-Using-Riak.html#seomoz (h/t
Myron Marston)

Who else is missing from the wiki?

2) This is a ways off but still worth mentioning: Andy Gross is
speaking on QCON in San Francisco about Riak Use Cases.

\* Details here ---&gt;
http://qconsf.com/sf2011/presentation/Riak+Use+Cases:+Dissecting+the+Solutions+to+Hard+Problems

3) Ryan Zezeski updated his "try try try" post on riak\_core and the vnode.

\* Linked here ---&gt; http://twitter.com/#!/rzezeski/status/111997743857274882

4) The slides that Sean Cribbs and Dan Reverri used for their
bi-coastal Riak 1.0 Preview talks last night are now online.

\* Check them out here ---&gt; http://riak-onedotoh-preview.heroku.com/#1

5) We merged some great contributions to the Python Client over the
past few days from Greg Stein and Soren Hansen. (h/t to Brett Hoerner
and Reid Draper for helping with the review.)

\* All here ---&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/commits/master

6) I sent out a link to this in a different thread today but it's
worth sharing again: Joe Blomstedt put together a screencast covering
what Riak's Cluster Membership looks like in 1.0.

\* Grab a beer and go watch this ---&gt;

7) Two great jobs to pass your way:

\* Twitch.tv, which is part of the Justin.tv family, has some openings
in San Francisco - and rumor has it that you'll be working with Riak

\* Strobe is looking for a DevPops Engineer ---&gt;
