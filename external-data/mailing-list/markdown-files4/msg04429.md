You will most likely need to build from source. Packages are made for

&gt; Excellent. When it goes into master does that mean a .deb will be
available
&gt; at http://downloads.basho.com/riak/CURRENT/ ?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Non-blocking key \_listing\_
&gt;
&gt; Am I correct in assuming non-blocking key listings amounts to non-blocking
&gt; when doing a key filter?

&gt;&gt; Non-blocking key \_listing\_ will land in master sometime before end of
&gt;&gt; August. There are a number of changes across the system that have to
&gt;&gt; be made first and it all has to be reviewed/integrated.
