&gt; The cluster seems to be running well. All of the riak-admin commands seem

&gt; I wonder if the cause of this is also what caused or is related to why my
&gt; merge\_index(s) were corrupt and I couldn't grow my cluster too?

I'm glad your cluster appears to be doing fine but the tainted ring msg
still worries me. I'm afraid it could cause your troubles in the future if
you decide to do something that involves the ring like adding/removing
nodes, changing bucket properties, etc. It's not too far fetched to think
this might be related to the corrupted merge\_index files, but it's too
early to say for sure and so at this point I'd consider them orthogonal.

If it's not too much of a hassel it would be great if you could tar/gz your
ring dir on all nodes and send them to me.
