Hi Marcel,

What is the configured ring size for this cluster?

You can slow down the transfers by running $ riak-admin transfer-limit 1 in
one of your riak nodes. iowait should decrease as well once transfer-limit
is lowered, unless one of your disks is failing or is about to fail.


Regards,
Ciprian

&gt; Two nodes in this cluster, had to be removed because they are no longer

&gt; So a force remove was done.
&gt;
&gt; After this, the 3 remaining nodes began to transfer all data. So we ended
&gt; up
&gt; with a complete unresponsive system. The iowait is blocking us now.
&gt; So we are hoping that this will settle today, the next transaction was
&gt; actually adding two new nodes.
&gt;
&gt; And yes this is production, Is there any chance we lost data?
