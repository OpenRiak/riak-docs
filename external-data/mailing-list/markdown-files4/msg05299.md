Hi Bryan - I'm now running 1.0.1 but the keys were inserted under 0.14. I
tried your test and it worked fine. So, maybe I'm caught between
inserting under an old version and now reading under another?

Thanks for your help.

Jim

&gt;&gt; Ok, this is a little simpler but I'm not sure how to proceed. When I

&gt;&gt; the keys via ?keys=stream API, I have a key "name-this\nBob".
&gt;&gt;But
&gt;&gt; fetching it gets me a 404 not found error. I've tried %0D%0A (and other
&gt;&gt; variants) in the API call but no luck. Any way to delete this errant

&gt;Hi, Jim. Just %0A seems to work for me:
&gt;
&gt;$ curl -X PUT -H "content-type: text/plain"
&gt;http://localhost:8098/riak/jim/one-two%0Athree --data "hello"
&gt;
&gt;$ curl http://localhost:8098/riak/jim?keys=true
&gt;{ÂŠ"keys":["one-two\nthree"]}
&gt;
&gt;$ curl http://localhost:8098/riak/jim/one-two%0Athree
&gt;hello
&gt;
&gt;$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8098/riak/jim/one-two%0Athree
&gt;$ curl http://localhost:8098/riak/jim/one-two%0Athree
&gt;not found
&gt;
&gt;That was on the tip of riak's master branch. If you're still having
&gt;trouble, could you please reply with the Riak version you're using (I
&gt;know that 0.14 had an odd encoding behavior that was fixed in 1.0[1]),
&gt;as well as your choice of client and a snippet or two of code?
