Hi,

The configured ring size is 64 (default i believe).
Is this something we can change now?
Also still riak is doing transfers, making some of the nodes unresponsive.
We've limited the transfers to 1.
But how do we handle this?

Kind regards,
Marcel

&gt; Hi Marcel,
&gt;
&gt; What is the configured ring size for this cluster?
&gt;
&gt; You can slow down the transfers by running $ riak-admin transfer-limit 1
&gt; in one of your riak nodes. iowait should decrease as well once
&gt; transfer-limit is lowered, unless one of your disks is failing or is about
&gt; to fail.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Ciprian

&gt;&gt; We have a 5 node riak cluster.
&gt;&gt; Two nodes in this cluster, had to be removed because they are no longer
&gt;&gt; available (since a half year).
&gt;&gt; So a force remove was done.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; After this, the 3 remaining nodes began to transfer all data. So we ended
&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt; with a complete unresponsive system. The iowait is blocking us now.
&gt;&gt; So we are hoping that this will settle today, the next transaction was
&gt;&gt; actually adding two new nodes.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And yes this is production, Is there any chance we lost data?
