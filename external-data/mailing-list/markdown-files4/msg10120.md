Hi Jeremiah,

It does indeed not seem to be documented on the main docs site, and I will try 
to correct this. The only place I have found it described is on the wiki for 
the Ruby client 
(https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/wiki/Secondary-Indexes).
 
Below is also an example of a simple mapreduce job that shows how to count the 
number of records in the 'goog' bucket based on the $bucket secondary index:

curl -XPOST http://localhost:8098/mapred 
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
 -d '{"inputs":{
 "bucket":"goof",
 "index":"$bucket",
 "key":"goof"
 },
 "query":[{"reduce":{"language":"erlang",
 "module":"riak\_kv\_mapreduce",
 "function":"reduce\_count\_inputs"}}]}'

I hope this helps.

Best regards,

Christian

&gt; Searching for $bucket produces search results just for "bucket" and Google 
&gt; says "No results found for site:docs.basho.com $bucket."

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to the $key index, there is also a $bucket index available by 
&gt; default. This contains the name of the bucket, and can be used to get all 
&gt; keys in a specific bucket.
&gt;
