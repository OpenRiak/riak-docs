In what order are the sort and rows options of search via the Solr API
applied?

It would appear that rows is applied first, with the cluster waiting just
long enough to receive enough answers to to fulfill the rows requirement,
and only then sorting the result set. Alas, if that is the case, then the
sort and rows parameters are useless for pagination.

I got a query that matching around 420 objects with indexed timestamps. I'd
like to return the latest 10 objects. Thus, I use sort="ts desc" and
rows="10", but the result set I get, while sorted, does not represent the
latest objects. The only way I can get the latest objects is to make rows
as large the the number of results, use sort="ts desc" to get Riak to do the
sort, then perform the slice at the client. This will become wasteful and
slow with queries that match many more objects.

Is this expected behavior?

Looks like I'll have to resort to MR jobs to get the behavior I want.
