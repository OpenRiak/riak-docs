Since 500 is not that big a number, I think you can run that many M/Rs with
each emitting only records having "time" greater than specified. Input
would be {index, &lt;&lt;"bucket"&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;"from\_bin"&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;"from\_field\_value"&gt;&gt;}

If you decide to split the data into separate buckets based on "from"
field, input would be {index, &lt;&lt;"from\_field\_value"&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;"time\_bin"&gt;&gt;,
&lt;&lt;"time\_low"&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;"time\_high"&gt;&gt;}

&gt; Hello, Yousuf.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your reply.
&gt;
&gt; We have several millions of items. It's about 10 000 of unique 'from'
&gt; fields (about 1000 items for each). Usually, we need to get items for about
&gt; 500 'from' identifiers with 'time' limit (about 5% of items is
&gt; corresponding).

&gt;&gt; Hi Andrew,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; First of all, the correct answer to your question is the proverbial "it
&gt;&gt; depends". Having said that, here is what I could do in your case
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. If there are enough data points with the same "from" field, I will
&gt;&gt; make it a bucket and then index on time.
&gt;&gt; 2. If the above is not true, I will index on "from" and "time" field.
&gt;&gt; a. If number of records where "time" is greater than the one your
&gt;&gt; require is small, I will run a map/reduce with the initial input as those
&gt;&gt; records.
&gt;&gt; b. If number of records having a particular "from" is small, I will
&gt;&gt; do the above with the initial input as records having that "from" field.
&gt;&gt; This could be a problem as Riak only supports range and exact queries so if
&gt;&gt; you want to query multiple identifiers, you will have to run multiple
&gt;&gt; queries.
&gt;&gt; In both the above cases, I will use secondary indexes to get the
&gt;&gt; initial records.
&gt;&gt; Note that we are using M/R as Riak does not support querying by
&gt;&gt; multiple indexes.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What I would also suggest is to partition your data into different
&gt;&gt; buckets. You will need to understand the queries that you will be
&gt;&gt; supporting and partition it accordingly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am considering several storage solutions for my project, and now I
&gt;&gt;&gt; look at Riak.
&gt;&gt;&gt; We work with the following pattern of data:
&gt;&gt;&gt; {
&gt;&gt;&gt; time: unixtime
&gt;&gt;&gt; from: int
&gt;&gt;&gt; data: binary
&gt;&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; }
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The amount of data is about several millions items for now, but it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; growing. It is necessary to handle the folloring requests: for a list of
&gt;&gt;&gt; identifiers (about 500 items) return all records where id = from and time
&gt;&gt;&gt; greater than a certain value.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; How to store such data and to effectively handle such requests with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Riak?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks.
