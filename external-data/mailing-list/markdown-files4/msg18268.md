Hi
I have a clustered riak node, when I'm using basho bench to take a
benchmark, performance falls down, (in spite of for example, 1K or 10K
insert rate) after some time, overall insert rate is not smooth at all.
OS status after performance reduction: High memory usage, high user I/O wait
is there any one to explain why riak behaving like this?
thanks in advance
