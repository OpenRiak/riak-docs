Regarding map/reduce emulation, I was thinking more along the lines of using
a single bucket to achieve a similar effect.
So then you can pull an object (column family aka row of columns), or via mr
pull just x columns. Then to update, again use mr (instead of standard
post,post,etc) to update individual columns of the "family" (by updating via
mr, you reduce needless updating of \*all\* columns within the object)

So then a bucket would be a super-column in this scenario, using mr
emulation within that same bucket.

Again, I'm not saying this is a good idea or worthwhile whatsoever, but it
seems it could be possible as long as standard save/retrieve methods are
built in mr.

&gt; Yes, it can be done via MapReduce as i was doing, but seeing the latest
&gt; developments that speed improvement was null was a shock to me, moreover
&gt; when i'm trying to build a social network... haha... I really think it will
&gt; help if buckets could be queried ( MapReduce ) directly without minding how
&gt; many buckets or data is inside Riak.

&gt; I second the motion!
&gt; BTW, as a side discussion, it may be possible to emulate that functionality
&gt; with map/reduce, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as powerful/versatile as
&gt; if the functionality were directly built into Riak... Not sure if emulation
&gt; via map/reduce would even be worth the effort to consider.

&gt;&gt; sorry, my bad, i wanted to say "ColumnFamilies" or
&gt;&gt; "SuperColumnFamilies", here there is some info:

&gt;&gt; Could it be possible to have "SuperColums" as Cassandra has? (
&gt;&gt; "SuperBuckets" would be more ideal name )
&gt;&gt; I think it would be a great improvement if we can query a bucket without
&gt;&gt; having to look at all buckets and keys in memory to search for it... this
&gt;&gt; way it would be easier and faster to modulate data so if you distribute data
&gt;&gt; in small buckets, the MapReduce on them would get faster... not sure if is
&gt;&gt; possible to implement, but is something i really would love to have in Riak
&gt;&gt; and it would help me a lot in my project... knowing that atomizing buckets (
&gt;&gt; "rohman\_messages", "fyodor\_messages" ) has no advantage over a huge
&gt;&gt; "messages" bucket really disappointed me.
&gt;&gt; thanks
