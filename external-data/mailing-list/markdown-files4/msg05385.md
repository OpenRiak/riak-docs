Hi Elias,

In addition to changing the -name setting in vm.args, you must also run the
'riak-admin reip' command. This command renames a node, essentially telling
the cluster that any data associated with the old node name should now be
associated with the new node name. The node in question should be offline
when you run the command.

More information is here:

Best,
Rusty

&gt; but the implication it that restore would fail.
&gt;
&gt; Is that the case?
&gt;
&gt; Can you change the -name value in vm.args of a node that has already
&gt; joined a cluster (e.g. shutdown the node, change the name, and restarted
&gt; it)?
