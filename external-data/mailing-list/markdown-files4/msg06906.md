Hello guys,

We are in production and noticed ALL of the M/R requests failing right
after a bulk delete with the following response returned back:

lineno":466,"message":"SyntaxError: syntax error","source":"()

The problem is now persistent even if the delete operation was done
awhile ago.
I googled to find a solution and realized this is a bug not fixed yet.
We have a cluster of 4 machines with riak (1.0.2 2011-11-17) Debian
x86\_64 installed.
I need a quick fix ASAP if someone could help me out.


For us, that means you need to check 
robject.values[i].metadata['X-Riak-Deleted'] before trying to parse the 
object as JSON.
