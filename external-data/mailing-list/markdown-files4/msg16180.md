Hi,
Riak CS 2 moved to a new Ubuntu/Debian repository, at packagecloud.io.
However attempts to use it as per the documentation result in the message
"Incorrect username or token" and an HTTP status of 401.

This is because the docs give the URL as similar to:
deb https://packagecloud.io/basho/riak\_cs/ubuntu/ precise main

However they are supposed to be?:

deb https://packagecloud.io/basho/riak-cs/ubuntu/ precise main

Note the dash instead of an underscore.

-Toby
