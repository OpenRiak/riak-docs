&gt; Does the riak claimant node have higher load than the other nodes?

Hi Travis,

The role of the claimant node is simply to coordinate certain cluster
related operations that involve changes to the ring, such as nodes joining
or leaving the cluster. Otherwise this node has no special role during
operations that manipulate data stored in the cluster.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
