Honestly, right now we need to work on optimising the Map. We do have a 
smaller/faster map in a branch that we’re working on shipping soon, as well as 
other optimisation planned.

Does your use case have you adding and removing registers, or is this basically 
a set schema of registers per key? If you’re not removing/re-adding registers, 
I would use a CRDT not in Riak, but in your application.

CRDTs in Riak make sense for causal data types: where the actor management is 
onerous for the client. What you’re modelling using the map looks like Last 
Write Wins element Set. This is a pretty simple CRDT to make in your own 
programming language/application, and you can write this data type yourself, 
and simply store the binary representation of it in riak, using riak’s siblings 
(allow\_mult=true.) hen your application gets siblings values, simply run you 
application code’s merge function.

There are details of the last write elements set here 
https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi, but all you need to is store a pair 
(element, TS) for each member in the set. If you’re going to store removing 
registers it gets more complex…are you?

Cheers

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Mark / Dennis,
&gt; 
&gt; Can you provide the snippet of the code that puts a 5k record onto Riak as a 
&gt; map?
&gt; 
&gt; Chris

&gt; Hi folks, sorry for the confusion.
&gt; 
&gt; Our scenario is as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; We have a 6 node development cluster running on its own network segment using 
&gt; HAProxy to facilitate load-balancing across the nodes. A single Riak-dot-NET 
&gt; client service is performing the insert operations from dedicated hardware 
&gt; located within the same network segment. We have basic network throughput 
&gt; capabilities of 100 Mbit with an average speed achievable of 75 Mbit.
&gt; 
&gt; The data we are attempting to insert is composed of phone call record 
&gt; receipts from telephone carriers. These records are batched and written to a 
&gt; flat file for incorporation into our reporting engine. 1) Our Riak client 
&gt; process takes a flat file (In this case, a 40MB collection of records, each 
&gt; record being approximately 5k in size) and parses the entire file so each 
&gt; record can be added to a local .NET queue.
&gt; 2) Once the entire file has been parsed and each record loaded into the local 
&gt; queue, 20 threads are spawned and connections are opened to our Riak nodes 
&gt; via the HAProxy.
&gt; 3) Each thread will pull a 5k record from the queue on a first come first 
&gt; served basis and perform a put to the Riak environment.
&gt; 
&gt; When first testing our client insert process, we were pushing the 5K records 
&gt; as whole strings into the Riak environment. Network throughput topped out at 
&gt; around 80 Mbits with a total load time of 90 seconds for 149k records. When 
&gt; the client process was modified (same queuing and de-queuing methods) so that 
&gt; a map datatype bucket would be created and keys stored as registers, we saw 
&gt; network throughput drop to around 10 Mbit with total upload time increase to 
&gt; around 270 seconds for the 149k records. 
&gt; 
&gt; It appears as though we’ve either encountered a potential bottleneck 
&gt; unrelated to network throughput, or we’re just seeing an expected processing 
&gt; penalty for our use of Riak datatypes. Please note, we’re configuring Zabbix 
&gt; so we can monitor disk IO on each node as processor and memory resources 
&gt; don’t appear to be the culprit either.
&gt; 
&gt; If the reduction in processing speed is a natural consequence to utilizing 
&gt; Riak data types, is the inter-node network the optimum place to increase 
&gt; resources? Our eventual datacenter implementation will support speeds of over 
&gt; 40 Gbit for inter-node communication. We’re just trying to identify which 
&gt; levers from an operational standpoint we can throw to boost performance, or 
&gt; if our client implementation is suspect.
&gt; 
&gt; You bring up some excellent points regarding our use of CRDTs. In our case, 
&gt; the call data records are mutable as they are subject to changes by phone 
&gt; carriers for billing error corrections, incorrect data and a host of other 
&gt; reasons. We may be better served by treating the records as immutable and 
&gt; performing wide scale record removal and “reprocessing” in the event changes 
&gt; to existing records are received/requested.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Let's talk about Riak data types for a moment. Riak data types are 
&gt; collectively implementations of what academia refer to as CRDT's (convergent 
&gt; or conflict free replicated data types.) The key benefit a CRDT offers, over 
&gt; a traditional KV by contrast, is in automatic conflict resolution. The 
&gt; various CRDT's provided in Riak have specific conflict resolution strategies. 
&gt; This does not come for free. There is a computational cost associated with 
&gt; CRDT's. If your use case requires automated conflict resolution strategies 
&gt; than CRDT's are a good fit. Internally CRDT's rely on vector clocks (see 
&gt; DVV's in the documentation) to resolve conflict. 
&gt; 
&gt; Considering your ETL use case I'm going to presume that your data is 
&gt; immutable (I could very well be wrong here.) If your data is immutable I 
&gt; would consider simply using a KV and not paying the CRDT computational 
&gt; penalty (and possibly even the write once bucket.) The CRDT penalty you pay 
&gt; is obviously subjective to your use case, configuration, hw deployment etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hope that helps!

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Dennis,
&gt; 
&gt; It's a bit unclear what you are trying to do here. Are you 1. uploading the 
&gt; entire file and saving it to one key with the value being the file? Or are 
&gt; you 2. parsing the file and storing each row as a register in a map? 
&gt; 
&gt; Either of those approaches are not appropriate in Riak KV. For the first case 
&gt; I would point you to Riak S2 which is designed to manage large binary object 
&gt; storage. You can keep the large file as a single addressable entity and 
&gt; access it via Amazon S3 or Swift protocol. For the second case I would 
&gt; consider maintaining one key (map) per row in the file and have a register 
&gt; per column in the row. Or not use Riak data types (maps, sets, registers, 
&gt; flags and counters) and simply keep each row in the file as a KV in Riak 
&gt; either as a raw string or as a serialized json string. ETL'ing out of 
&gt; relational databases and into Riak is a very common use case and often 
&gt; implemented in the fashion I described. 
&gt; 
&gt; As Chris mentioned, soft upper bound on value size should be 1MB. I say soft 
&gt; because we won't enforce it although there are settings in the config that 
&gt; can be changed to enforce it (default 5MB warning, 50MB reject I believe.) 
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; Alexander

&gt; Hi Dennis,
&gt; 
&gt; I am not the most experienced, but what I do know is that a file that size 
&gt; causes a great deal of network chatter because it has to handoff that data to 
&gt; the other nodes in the network and will cause delays in Riak's ability to 
&gt; send and confirm consistency across the ring. Typically we recommend that you 
&gt; try to structure your objects to around 1mb or less to ensure consistent 
&gt; performance. That max object size can vary of course based on your network / 
&gt; server specs and configuration.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this helps.
