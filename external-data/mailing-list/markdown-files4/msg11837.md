I'm happy to wait, it isn't urgently needed as my project is still in
development.

I'd contribute myself if I was confident at all programming in Erlang but
I'm still just getting into declarative languages at the moment :)

&gt; Hi Lucas,
&gt;
&gt; I'm sorry, as easy as it would have been to add with the latest changes,
&gt; we just ran out of time.
&gt;
&gt; It is something I'd love to add in future. Or maybe something a
&gt; contributor could add? (Happy to advise / review.)
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I've seen that the results of secondary index queries are sorted on
&gt; index values by default.
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if there's something I'm missing that would allow me to
&gt; fetch those keys but reverse sorted.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have indexes based on UNIX timestamps and I'd like to grab the most
&gt; recent keys.
&gt; &gt; I'd like this query to be running on demand so I'd like to avoid
&gt; MapReduce if at all possible.
