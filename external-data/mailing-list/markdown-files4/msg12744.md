Ok, that changes things a lot. You're running with allow\_mult=false, so
Riak will automatically resolve siblings for you if you create them. Are
you doing 'get before put' for your updates? That is, doing the PUT with
the vclock of the old value, or are you doing 'new' puts with a blank
vector clock?
