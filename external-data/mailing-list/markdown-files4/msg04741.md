&gt; &gt; I learnt from the mailing list that there is no direct way to link walk
&gt; on PBClient as we do with HttpClient.
&gt; &gt; Has any one implemented it on their own. If so, kindly share me the
&gt; patch.
&gt;
&gt; You can with the 0-15-SNAPSHOT riak-java-client from master. Though it is
&gt; actually implemented as 2 Map/reduce operations.
