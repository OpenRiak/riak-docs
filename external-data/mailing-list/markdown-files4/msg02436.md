I believe in a three node cluster your replicas are algorithmically guaranteed 
to be on two nodes. I think it is something like p=n-1. Where p is physical 
machines and n are replicas.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, whatever N you set, they might end up on the same hard
&gt; disk, meaning that one hard disk crash can mean you lose data and/or
&gt; make data not readable. Probability is low, but it can happen.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I correct?
