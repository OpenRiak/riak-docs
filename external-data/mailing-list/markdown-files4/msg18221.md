I don't contribute to this list as much as I lurk in #riak (craque), but
it's really great to see this kind of community support somewhere,
especially at a large place that is heavily invested in riak itself.

I have considered posting some of the operational lessons I've learned over
the past five years on riak-based systems. If there will be an organized
effort around these types of things, I'm here to help and would love to be
involved as well.

&gt; Apologies in advance if this doesn't quite submit correctly to the list.
&gt;
&gt; We [bet365] are very much interested in the continued development of Riak
&gt; in its current incarnation, with Core continuing to be underpinned by
&gt; distributed Erlang. We are very keen to help to build / shape / support the
&gt; community around the project. Internally, we have assembled a team to
&gt; continue the development of Riak, along a roadmap, and are also looking to
&gt; bring more expertise into the business to help support this. Whilst the
&gt; Lasp / Partisan project sounds really interesting, and something that could
&gt; probably be of interest to us in the future, our immediate focus is around
&gt; stabilising and securing the project in its current form. We’re looking to
&gt; take Riak forward by contributing to a renewed community effort.
&gt;
&gt; In summary, we're committed to continuing the development of Riak (we've
&gt; already assembled / growing a team to do so) and are happy to engage with,
&gt; and support, the community in order to move the project forward.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
