Hi John,

Yes the Java client is meant to be used exactly as you describe;
create one instance of IRiakClient and share it across threads. The
client itself maintains a connection pool internally so that multiple
operations can occur concurrently in different threads.

Thanks,
- Roach

&gt; Hi -

&gt; I am currently using the PBC implementation of the IRiakClient. Going
&gt; through the code, it appears that it is safe to instantiate statically and
&gt; share among threads.
&gt;
&gt; I just wanted to verify if this is the case, or it would be preferable to
&gt; instantiate a new client each call.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
