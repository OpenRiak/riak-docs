Awesome! Can't wait to try it! What about the python client for Riak 2.0? I
remember testing the actual version and still have many issues and
non-workable new features (like counters, sets, maps, etc.)

Thanks!
Alex

&gt; Riak-Users,
&gt;
&gt; Everyone at Basho is extremely happy to announce the public availability
&gt; of Riak 2.0.0 RC. As a release candidate, we do not recommend using it in
&gt; production, but it should be considered feature and API complete for Riak
&gt; 2.0 final. We reserve the right to make changes for any data-loss or severe
&gt; performance issues found post-RC, but these will not affect the API.
&gt;
&gt; This is our most ambitious release, with major new features throughout the
&gt; product. With that in mind, please take plenty of time to read through the
&gt; Release Notes. There are some important considerations regarding upgrades,
&gt; known issues, and packaging. The Release Notes are still a work-in-progress
&gt; and will be continually updated as we march towards 2.0 final. We have made
&gt; a lot of progress on our docs site  for 2.0, but
&gt; still have work to do before final release. We appreciate your patience.
