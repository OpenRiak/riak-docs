Strange. If you call shutdown of Riak client it shouldn't stop Tomcat
shutdown anymore. This is that I learn from source code. I called the
method in Servlet listener and never had issues after that. Before I had
similar behavior like you have.

Thank you,
Konstantin.

&gt; That's done already, I'm looking at the source now, not sure of the
&gt; following timer needs to be cancelled when Riak client shutdown method is
&gt; called:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; public abstract class RiakStreamClient implements Iterable {
&gt;
&gt; static Timer TIMER = new Timer("riak-stream-timeout-thread", true);
&gt; ...
&gt; ...
&gt; }

&gt; You need to call shutdown method of Riak client when you are stopping your
&gt; application.

&gt; Thank you,

&gt; Sorry, I meant "stopping Tomcat from shutting down properly"...I must
&gt; have been thinking of some FPS night game.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; We are tracing some threads at our webapp which are stopping Tomcat from
&gt; shooting down properly, one of them seems to be related with Riak Java
&gt; client, here is the repeating stack trace once all services have been
&gt; stopped properly:
&gt;
&gt; \*Thread Name:\* riak-stream-timeout-thread
&gt; \*State:\* in Object.wait()
&gt; \*Java Stack trace:\*
&gt; at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)
&gt; - waiting on [0x00000004bb4001a0] (a java.util.TaskQueue)
&gt; at java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:503)
&gt; at java.util.TimerThread.mainLoop(Timer.java:526)
&gt; - locked [0x00000004bb4001a0] (a java.util.TaskQueue)
&gt; at java.util.TimerThread.run(Timer.java:505)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the help,
&gt;
&gt; Guido.
