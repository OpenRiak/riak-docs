&gt; Is written in Erlang ( the core app ) but the MR jobs are written in
&gt; Python... in the same way that Riak is written in Erlang but the MR jobs
&gt; are written in JavaScript ( also can be written in Erlang though )
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; Has anyone tried to use Riak with Disco? [ http://discoproject.org ] I
&gt; was looking for Hadoop alternatives ( as the RIAK-HADOOP connector project
&gt; seems not going anywhere ) and I think Disco is quite interesting, moreover
&gt; is written in Erlang same as Riak. Looks like it would be a good match!
&gt;
&gt; Looks interesting, though it's It's written in Python from what I can see,
&gt; not Erlang ;) Still makes a refreshing change yet-another-java-thing though.
