Hi Alex,

Thanks for your swift response.

I will try to elaborate the use case to you so as to get the context.

Our application is related to Telemetry. We want to build a system which 
actually be able to handle writes without any data loss. We are expecting 100TB 
data per day. Data retention is 90days. In this application, we would be 
reading the records and may show up in portal/use for analytics. Would RIAK TS 
be able to handle this kind of data?

As far as I understand, GLOBAL TTL is something which enables the table level 
expiration policy. Please correct us if wrong.

Thanks & Regards,

Hi Rajaa,

What's your retention policy? At the moment, TS supports a global TTL. What's 
your read pattern? Is this a metrics or logging use case, aka can you 
downsample.

Thanks,
Alexander

Dear Team,


As a process of validation, we would like to know certain aspects w.r.t Riak 
TS. Let's say per day 100TB real time data we get in our application which 
crossed around more than petabytes of data in sometime.

Would RIAK TS be an Ideal Choice for the above application ground. If so, 1. 
How it will handle the data. 2. What is the performance of Reads/Writes that we 
can expect. 3. How fast RIAK TS would be compared to MongoDB, Cassandra & Druid
