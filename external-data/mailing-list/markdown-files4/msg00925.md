Hi, Michael.

This is something that we think is an important idea, and that the
underlying structure of Riak can work fine with. However, simply out
of prioritization thus far we have not yet made it easy to do this and
doing so effectively is not simple from a user point of view. I do
not know of any production clusters at this time that use anything
other than the standard near-equal distribution of vnodes.

I do expect that explicitly configuring different nodes to have
different "weight" will be enabled in a future release, but it is not
currently on anyone's scheduled plans that I know of.
