&gt; Hi Daniel, 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure of the specific regex you can run here. The most detail I found 
&gt; is from this: https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/696

&gt; Adds a regular expression filter for secondary index terms. With this
&gt; you can scan a range for a binary index from, say A through Z, but only
&gt; use items that match terms containing "AA".
&gt; This filter does not work with integer queries, but it does work with
&gt; $key queries.
&gt; 
&gt; Though maybe you can read the source code better than I can: 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/pull/715/files#r7406033

Given Erlang doesn’t guarantee feature parity with Perl Compatible Regular 
Expressions [1], to be safe, I would validate any sufficiently complex regular 
expression in the Erlang shell with ‘re:compile’ and ‘re:run.’
