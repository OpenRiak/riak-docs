&gt; Hello, I have been trying to compile erlang\_js with OTP 18.3, but allways I

&gt; and OSX 10.11.4.

&gt; Here you can find the full log of my error:

&gt; Any suggestion?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance

&gt; Hi Humberto,
&gt; 
&gt; I saw that you also opened a github issue about this 
&gt; (https://github.com/basho/erlang\_js/issues/61 
&gt; ), and that you were pointed to 
&gt; this pull request (https://github.com/basho/erlang\_js/pull/58 
&gt; ) that may fix the issue for you.
&gt; 
&gt; The development engineers are working on a OTP-18 compatible code base and a 
&gt; release planned for later this year should work with OTP-18. According to the 
&gt; program managers this will also then include OTP-18 compatible versions of 
&gt; Erlang based client libraries.
&gt; 
&gt; Please bear with us while the development work is being done.
&gt; 
&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Magnus

Hi Magnus,

Thanks, that pull request fixed my problem, now it works in both Linux and OSX 
:)

Best regards,
Humberto
