Brisa,

You cannot simulate transactions, really (see also
http://aphyr.com/posts/254-burn-the-library). However, if you want to
receive notifications and take action when something happens, you can
add a postcommit hook (see
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/appendices/concepts/Commit-Hooks/).
In the past, developers have added hooks that push updates into a
RabbitMQ broker or ZeroMQ channel.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I want to simulate a transaction.
&gt; I want to know when a riak operation happens.
&gt; I know that riak isn't a relational database, but it is important for me in
&gt; particular cases to undo operations when something goes wrong.
&gt; Any have any suggestion for me about I want to do?
&gt; Thank you very much.
