Hi Kenny,

I would recommend using the Erlang PBC client rather than the native Erlang
client. The performance is comparable and it reduces coupling between your
code and Riak.

The following rebar.config option will pull in the PBC client:
 {riakc, ".\*", {hg, "http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak-erlang-client",
"tip"}},

You can find documentation here:
https://wiki.basho.com/display/RIAK/Erlang+Client+PBC

You can ignore the "./rebar install" part in the Overview section since you
will be including it as a dependency in your application.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Dan

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I had an earlier project using webmachine. I added the riak dependencies,
&gt; which also use webmachine, and now my existing webmachine code is broken.
&gt;
&gt; I found a related blog 
&gt; postabout
&gt; this issue, but things are still not working despite the dispatch\_list
&gt; looking correct at runtime. I can take out the riak apps from my rel file
&gt; to get the original functionality working (but riak not working obviously).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas how I can troubleshoot?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
