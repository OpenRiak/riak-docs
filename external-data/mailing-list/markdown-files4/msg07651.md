Hi,

I use riak a lot (0.14.2), but I dont need the javascript api ever.

Is there any way to disable javascript in riak (and spidermonkey if 
that's part of javascript). Ideally I am thinking about configuration 
in the app.config.


Note: I dont want to set all the settings to zero. I want the js 
application (if there is a js application) to be never loaded.


Thanks

Rory

P.S I havent upgraded to a more recent version due to time pressures. 
If this is possible in a later version that might be a compelling reason
