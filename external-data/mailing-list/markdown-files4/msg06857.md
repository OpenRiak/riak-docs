Phil,
Its a pretty well known issue. If you don't mind an older version of the
riak client there is a folk on github that does support this
https://github.com/bretthoerner/riak-python-client/branches.
Your other option is to manage it in your app or subclass the transport
object.
Some people use haproxy. I'm not a fan of this approach in production,
since the load balancer is now the point of failure.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I've just created my first 3 node riak cluster and must admit that I'm
&gt; stunned! However, it seems like the RiakClient is missing a really
&gt; important functionality for HA software. AFAIK you can only specify a
&gt; single server. I want to host a large riak cluster and a frontend
&gt; cluster separately. Using a single server for connecting would be a
&gt; huge single point of failure.
&gt;
&gt; Am I missing something?
&gt;
&gt; It would be nice if it would be possible to specify multiple servers
&gt; and the clients automatically chooses a random server that's available
&gt; from this list.
&gt;
