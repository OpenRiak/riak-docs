Hi everyone !

I'm looking for a NoSQL solution to get ride of MySQL.
In this particular issue, I think that Riak is one of the top of my choices in 
order to do what I'm looking for.

I would like to store all my users into Riak.
I understand that Riak is document oriented, so that's great for getting every 
information really fast from one user.
One of the feature I'm really interested in, are Links.

Links seems to be a great way for me to create association between usersâ€¦ 

When A adds B, I create a link from A to B.
When B accepts A's invitation, I create a link from B to A.

If links are not both ways, e.g. A to B to A, message can not go through (B who 
didn't accept A should not get its message yet)

My server is coded in Erlang, I have checked the Erlang riak client, and I 
didn't see something as simple as the HTTP use of Links in the demo.

1 - Are Link walking in Erlang fast & easy ?
2 - Is it possible to check fast if A -&gt; B -&gt; A (still in Erlang)? ('-&gt;' 
represents Links)

Thank you for your help !

Morgan.
