Not sure if anyone else is running into this... my bucket size isnt too big,
40000 keys or so. I need to reiterate through all the keys in the bucket. I
can get a response easily and quickly from http-&gt;?keys=stream but when i try
to query it from the python client it just takes minutes and times out....

Anyone else run into this and have a solution for it?
