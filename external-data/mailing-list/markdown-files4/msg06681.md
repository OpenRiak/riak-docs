Rohman,

You'll also need to enable HTTPS (and SSL) in the riak\_core section of the 
app.config file. Also, don't forget to change the port used for HTTPS to 
something different (I personally use 8069).

Note the required changes to the app.config file in the README: 
https://github.com/basho/riak\_control/blob/master/README.org.

If you have any additional problems, let me know; I'll be glad to help.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I just installed the new Riak 1.1 and activated Riak-Control through 
&gt; app.config:
&gt; 
&gt; %% riak\_control config
&gt; {riak\_control, [
&gt; %% Set to false to disable the admin panel.
&gt; {enabled, true},
&gt; 
&gt; However, i'm having trouble seeing the admin UI... I navigate to 
&gt; http://MYIP:8098 and I can see the admin links, but when i click on any of 
&gt; them, it redirects me to https://MYIP/admin ( mind the switch from HTTP to 
&gt; HTTPS and the losing of the port :8098 )... and of course, my browser gives a 
&gt; "can't connect to server" error message... i'm on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and i have 
&gt; an apache2 installed too in this server ( testing environment )
&gt; 
&gt; What am I doing wrong?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Rohman
