Ahmed - 

You can't define erlang functions in the Java client and send them as part of 
the MR like you can with JavaScript, but if you were to write the functions in 
erlang, put them on your RIak nodes (see below), and use them as named funcs in 
your MR jobs you'll find the performance is far better than JavaScript. 

To make your erlang modules and functions available to MR they need to be 
available on all nodes in the cluster. You can add them by adding the path to 
the "add\_paths" setting in the app.config. 

Thanks,
Brian Roach
