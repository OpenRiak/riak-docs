I did some tests and saw that it is correct only for very recent keys.
The DB becomes consistent for specific key very fast (few seconds) at
least for 5 nodes in 1Gbit network (which seems to be enough or almost
enough
for required capacity and throughput with bitcask backend).

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Absolutely new (and ignorant) to NoSQL solutions and to Riak (my
&gt; &gt; apologies; but extensive experience with SQL RDBMS).
&gt;
&gt; --snip--
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The application should be able to write several hundreds of new
&gt; &gt; records per second, but first check if the unique key already exists.
&gt; &gt; Writing is to be done only if it is not there. If it is, the app needs
&gt; &gt; to retrieve the whole record and return it to the client and no
&gt; &gt; writing is done in this case.
&gt;
&gt; Since Riak is an eventually consistent database, you will not be able to
&gt; tell
&gt; with 100% certainty that a key or does not exist. If this is a \_firm
&gt; requirement\_,
&gt; you'll need to either use another db or some external service to provide
&gt; this
&gt; guarantee.
