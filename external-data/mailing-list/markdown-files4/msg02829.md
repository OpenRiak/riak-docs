Yes, use a search query to initiate your MapReduce job, however, the results 
will not be limited to a fixed number (all matches will be returned). If that 
will work for you, initiate your job like so:

{"inputs":{"mod":"riak\_search", "fun":"mapred\_search", "arg":["bucketname", 
"updated:2011-03\*"]},
 "query":[ ... ]}

It might be worthwhile to try the query from the search shell or the solr 
endpoint first, just to be sure you're getting the results you want.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; a noob question really but here we go:
&gt; 
&gt; A have a number of records that have been indexed via riaksearch. Each of the 
&gt; records has an 'updated' field (example: ... 'updated': '2011-03-31T22:26:31' 
&gt; ... ) based on which I would like to sort all the records getting out limited 
&gt; number of those that are most of date (just the tip or the left-hand-side of 
&gt; the long list). Can I do it without traversing the whole bucket in the map 
&gt; phase?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks, Thomas
