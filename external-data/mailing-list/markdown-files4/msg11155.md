This coming Wednesday (5/29) at the Atlanta Tech Village [0], Basho
will be holding its second Atlanta Riak meetup [1]. Tom Santero and
myself will be presenting on how to properly configure and tune Riak
for different use cases. We'll also cover how to monitor and profile
Riak, as well as the underlying operating system.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Also, if you
have any interest in giving a talk about your use of Riak at a meetup,
please drop me a note.

Hope to see you there!
