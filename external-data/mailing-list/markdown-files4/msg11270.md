You need to delete the data/ring directory, then try again.

You need to make the changes \*before\* starting riak, not after. If you make any 
changes to the system, the configurations that the ring first builds will not 
longer be true.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone help me in running riak service. Following are the things did on 
&gt; my linux 6.2 server:
&gt; 
&gt; Installed riak, riak-cs, stanchion services as per the instructions given 
&gt; @http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Building-a-Local-Test-Environment/
&gt; 
&gt; Before making changes in /etc/riak/app.config I could succefully stark the 
&gt; riak service. However after making changes in the file as per the 
&gt; instructions given in Step:3 , failed to strat riak service.
&gt; 
&gt; [root@RIAK-57 ~]# riak start
&gt; Attempting to restart script through sudo -H -u riak
&gt; Riak failed to start within 15 seconds,
&gt; see the output of 'riak console' for more information.
&gt; If you want to wait longer, set the environment variable
&gt; WAIT\_FOR\_ERLANG to the number of seconds to wait.
&gt; 
&gt; Riak version installed: riak-1.3.1-1.el6.x86\_64
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
