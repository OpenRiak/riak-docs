Kelly,

Thank you for the prompt response.

I installed from DEB and it's working just fine now.

&gt; Using the DEB package is probably the best way to start out. It'll be quicker 
&gt; to get started and you won't have to worry about installing all the tools to 
&gt; build from source. Last I checked the erlang version of the package that 
&gt; Ubuntu installs via apt is old and doesn't work with the latest branches of 
&gt; riak anyway so you would also have to build erlang from source. So the path 
&gt; of least resistance is to use the deb.

&gt;&gt; I'm new to Riak so please forgive a newbie question. I searched the email 
&gt;&gt; archives and did not see a discussion about this...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I will setup several VMWare Ubuntu instances to run a Riak ring so I can 
&gt;&gt; perform some testing and then development.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of using the binary DEB 
&gt;&gt; package compared to building from source?
