&gt; I see you are doing a disjunction search across the type field `(type:image
&gt; type:video type:FacebookPost)`. How many documents match that sub-query?
&gt; If it is over 100k then legacy Riak Search will fail to return on the query
&gt; causing it to timeout. In general, legacy Riak Search has issues with
&gt; larger result sets. In 2.0 there is a new version of Riak Search (code name
&gt; Yokozuna) which should have much less issues with larger result sets. You
&gt; can try playing with it via the 2.0.0pre11 download.
