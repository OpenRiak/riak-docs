&gt; Hi Paul and Magnus,
&gt; I have resolve it by using command :
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - riak stop
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - changing nodename into file riak.conf from nodename = riak@127.0.0.1
&gt; to riak@192.168.1.10
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - riak-admin reip riak@127.0.0.1 riak@192.168.1.10
&gt;
&gt; But I have another problem, riak starts with this IP but shut down after
&gt; about 15 seconds.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Can you tell me how can I resolve this?
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Jurgen

Hi Jurgen,

Can post the portion of the console.log since the last restart of Riak,
please? Without further information it's hard to guess what may have gone
wrong.

Kind Regards,

Magnus
