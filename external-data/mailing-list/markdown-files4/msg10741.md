&gt;From past experience, DynamoDB costs are driven primarily by desired
request capacity (per table). If you're interested in a technical
comparison between DynamoDB and Riak, see the comparisons section [0]
on our docs site.

&gt; I can't speak to the costing issues, as that isn't something I am
&gt; terribly familiar with, but at the moment, riak still has some
&gt; overhead issues with very small values. There are upcoming
&gt; optimizations in the next major (1.4) release that should help. What
&gt; issues did you run into?

&gt;&gt; Spent some time with the AWS folks the other day and was getting sold on
&gt;&gt; using DynamoDB for some of our large Key Value store needs. However given
&gt;&gt; the read/write economics of DynamoDB vs. Instance+Storage costs on Riak I
&gt;&gt; was wondering if anybody has done a good thinking around where the cost
&gt;&gt; inflections points are?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also before I go and benchmark things how does Riak perform with 2B entries
&gt;&gt; which are &lt; 1K in size, when I last did the benchmarks - just before 1.0 -
&gt;&gt; there were a few issues.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
