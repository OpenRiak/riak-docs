Hi,

I have done a benchmark in Riak and I find that Insert a new record has the
lowest latency and Get's latecy (seek a record by key) is the middle one
(in terms of latency) and Update command has the highest latency.
Latency means the amount of time that each operation takes to complete.

What is the reason of this order?
How can I reduce the GET latency? (I know It might cause an increase in
Insert latency)

Thanks,
Alek
