&gt; 1% and 4% disk usage.
&gt; Anyone seen that before?

I have not seen this error before; have you been able to reproduce?

The logging is consistent with various bits-and-bobs of MR/Pipe
shutting down -- nothing serious that I can see. It could very well be
related to deletion, but I would be surprised to only see one node
having issues with it.
