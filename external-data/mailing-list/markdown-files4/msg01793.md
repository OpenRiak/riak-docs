hi guys, want to ask you guys a question, when we write a datarum to a
cluster with N=3, does Riak write the 3 nodes synchronized and verify the
result &gt;= W? or just write to a single node then gossip the change to the
other two nodes asynchronuously? I guess it's synchronized because i don't
understand how we can verify write is successful (&gt;=W) if it's async, right?
