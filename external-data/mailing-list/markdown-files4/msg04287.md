&gt;&gt; I'm already a huge fan of Riak after the short time that I've worked with
&gt;&gt; it, but a common concern I've seen is regarding performance.
&gt;&gt; To continue to take advantage of it's data persistence features, powerful
&gt;&gt; m/r functionality, etc, but to gain performance, I'm thinking of pairing
my
&gt;&gt; application with another (throwaway) nosql solution that would exist to
&gt;&gt; provide greater read performance.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This inspiration comes from seeing others using MongoDB + MySQL, for
&gt;&gt; instance. I'm thinking using something such as Memcache, or Membase&lt;
http://www.couchbase.org/get/couchbase&gt; (though
&gt;&gt; I haven't checked into setup requirements), may be a good option, as I'm
&gt;&gt; already accustomed to caching with Memcache from PHP, but I've not had
any
&gt;&gt; large-scale experience with Memcache yet.
&gt;&gt; Ideally anything that is lightweight, easy to roll out, and extremely
fast.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Before I venture down this road, are there any comments on this approach?
&gt;&gt; Any suggestions or recommendations?
&gt;&gt; Or are there speedy solutions available for Riak already?
