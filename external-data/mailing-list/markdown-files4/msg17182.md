Actually, 'riak-admin wait-for-service  ' can be a good
way of checking if a Riak service has fully started. For example, 'riak-admin
wait-for-service riak\_kv riak@127.0.0.1' (
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/tools/riak-admin/#wait-for-service,
more details in http://littleriakbook.com/). This command will exit when
the service is finally up. A list of available services can be printed using
'riak-admin services'. I believe it should work with Riak S2 as well as
Riak KV.

Best,
Vitaly

&gt; I end up adding some markers on image initialization and I watch the
&gt; docker container logs for this message before trying to use the instance.
&gt;
&gt; I tried using riak-cs ping, but unfortunately the ping was not enough.
&gt; e.g. sometimes the riak kv was still initialising when I got a ping
&gt; response from riak-cs.

&gt;&gt; You could try a `riak-cs ping` command and make sure it gets a "pong"
&gt;&gt; response as output. That's not a solid guarantee that everything's totally
&gt;&gt; started, but its better than just sleeping and hoping for the best.
