&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; 
&gt; I just wanted to let you know that I'm currently investigating this and will 
&gt; get back to you shortly. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've opened the following issue for tracking it:
&gt; 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak\_control/issues/128
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, in retrospect I've realized that using the "incompatible" 
&gt; language is a bit misleading -- only a subset of functionality becomes 
&gt; unavailable when Control detects a possible incompatibility, and this is 
&gt; usually limited to display a node's memory utilization (leaving management 
&gt; commands unaffected.) 
&gt; 
&gt; I've opened the following issue for tracking updating the language to provide 
&gt; a less ambiguous, more concrete, display of what is actually happening within 
&gt; the cluster:

&gt; Thanks for being so patient and diligent with testing our latest releases!

&gt; I upgraded my cluster to 1.4.1 in hopes the levelDB changes may help. The 
&gt; cluster is now up and running, however Riak Control is complaining:
&gt; 
&gt; The following nodes are currently incompatible with Riak Control:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I googled around and saw this had something to do with the RPC calls failing, 
&gt; but I can't find any logs on the server that give me a hint where to go next.
&gt; 
&gt; When I rebuilt from source, my rel directory was nuked, so I needed to 
&gt; regenerate my certs. Would this screw things up?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
