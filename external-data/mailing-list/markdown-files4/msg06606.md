Nicolas, Göran -

Great stuff! I'm happy to report that all your hard work has earned you a
much-coveted spot on the Riak Wiki [1] :) Feel free to add/remove anything
to the wiki as you see fit, and keep us up-to-date on the code. Looks like
people wil get a lot of use out it. Also, don't be scared to send along
details on how you're using/planning to use it in production (assuming you
are).

Mark

&gt; Hi!
&gt;
&gt; Göran and I worked on a Riak client for Pharo Smalltalk named Phriak.
&gt; You can download the code at 
&gt; http://www.squeaksource.com/\*\*Phriak
&gt; Today I released the version 0.3.
&gt;
&gt; Riak is a screamingly cool NoSQL database that scales like crazy. It's a
&gt; distributed, data agnostic db (see 
&gt; http://wiki.basho.com/Riak.\*\*html
&gt; ).
&gt;
&gt; There's a Metacello package ConfigurationOfPhriak for simple loading.
&gt;
&gt; As of today, Phriak supports (through the HTTP API):
&gt; - Bucket properties
&gt; - Objects metadata
&gt; - Links and link walking
&gt; - Secondary indexing
&gt; - Map/Reduce
&gt; - VClock and Siblings resolution
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Nico
