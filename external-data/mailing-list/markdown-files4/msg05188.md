&gt;&gt; Anyhow, enough description. If you're using Python, then I'd highly

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hope that helps, and let me know if you run into any problems with it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for this. Your changes look great.
&gt;
&gt; I take it you're not using Python 2.7?

I'm using Python 2.7 in production, and 2.5 on my dev machine (Mac OS,
Leopard). I've recently installed 2.7 on my dev box for its builtin
'ssl' module, and so more of my dev work is moving to 2.7. I need an
HTTPSConnection subclass to be used by the Riak client, which should
be possibly by subclassing some transport stuff; I'll be validating
that work shortly.

&gt; "The unicode problem"[1][2]
&gt; makes it rather unusable for me with Python 2.7. :( (Not due to your
&gt; changes, but the Riak Python client in general)

What is it about 2.7 that makes the problem worse for you? Are you
using Unicode keys or bucket names?

Cheers,
