Hi Neville,

Thanks! Performance comparisons are tricky business. Any time you
compare a distributed system to a non-distributed system on a single
machine, the non-distributed system is going to be much, much faster
simply because it can skip all of the overhead needed to make the system
distributed.

So for 1M 1K docs, which can easily fit on one machine, Lucene will be
much faster.


But there is another part of that question, even for content that would 
have fit on one system. Can the distributed system handle more 
simultaneous queries without slowing down because of the distributed 
nature (assuming the queries are also distributed over the nodes and 
refer to different data items)?
