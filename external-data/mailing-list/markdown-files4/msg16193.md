Hey Toby,

Which documentation pointed you to the wrong URL? And did the dash
address the issue? We can and should update that documentation.

On a related note, our packaging is up for discussion. A few of us
started discussing it here [1]. I'd love for you to weigh in.

Thanks,

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Riak CS 2 moved to a new Ubuntu/Debian repository, at packagecloud.io.
&gt; However attempts to use it as per the documentation result in the message 
&gt; "Incorrect username or token" and an HTTP status of 401.
&gt;
&gt; This is because the docs give the URL as similar to:
&gt; deb https://packagecloud.io/basho/riak\_cs/ubuntu/ precise main
&gt;
&gt; However they are supposed to be?:
&gt;
&gt; deb https://packagecloud.io/basho/riak-cs/ubuntu/ precise main
&gt;
&gt; Note the dash instead of an underscore.
