Hi Greg,

I threw together a quick example using a custom function for key and 
value generation here:

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

 Hi all

 My illustrious employer has tasked me with evaluating riak as a
 replacement for our inhouse K, V store.

 As part of this evaluation I need to performance test riak,
 looking around I see that basho\_bench appears to be quite a well
 laid out tool that should save me a lot of effort in terms of
 creating test plans with a traditional tool like jmeter.

 However we would like to test with our real dataset rather than
 with random data.

 As such I have written an erlang module that allows me to expose
 our seed data set as a tuple of {ID, Binary}.

 I want to integrate this into basho\_bench in the custom
 value\_generator and key\_generator functions, however the
 documentation is a little sparse and I am struggling to work out
 what I am expected to return for my function in both cases.

 Does anyone have any pointers, or better yet, examples of such
 things.

 Many thanks

 -- Greg
