What versions of Riak are you using? And are these CRDT sets?

&gt; I'm a sysadmin and I managing 5 cluster of RIAK:
&gt;
&gt; - two of them are LXC containers on the same physical machine (3 nodes
&gt; per cluster)
&gt; - one of them are LXC containers located on different physical
&gt; machines (6 nodes)
&gt; - one of them are LXC containers located on different physical
&gt; machines and XEN VMs (6 nodes)
&gt; - and the last of them are VMware ESX VMs (3 nodes)
&gt;
&gt; Our application works correctly on the first four clusters, but it
&gt; doesn't work as we expected on the last one.
&gt;
&gt; When we update a key and we retrieve this key in order to write it
&gt; again, it has an old value (it doesn't have the first value that we
&gt; wrote), for example:
&gt;
&gt; The key has: lalala
&gt; We retrieve the key, and add lololo, so it should be lalala,lololo
&gt; We retrieve the key again, and try to add lelele, so it should be now:
&gt; lalala,lololo,lelele, but when we retrieve it again, we only have:
&gt; lalala,lelele
&gt;
&gt; In the second write action, when we retrieve the key, we obtained a
&gt; key with the old value. We set r, w, pr and rw to 3 to the REST
&gt; requests, but it doesn't help.
&gt;
&gt; All the configuration files are very similiar and we don't have any
&gt; major differences in the disk I/O and network performance of the nodes
&gt; of the clusters.
&gt;
&gt; Did anyone have a similar issue?
&gt;
&gt; Regards.
