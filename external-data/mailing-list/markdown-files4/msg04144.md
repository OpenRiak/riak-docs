As I remember it, if you want to do Map/Reduce with erlang, you can only use 
functions that have been compiled and uploaded to the Riak cluster. That is: 
there's no way to write your erlang M/R jobs on the fly like you can do with 
JavaScript

&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I want to know if there is a way to do a map/Reduce query using pure erlang 
&gt; library without (even for the map/reduce query functions) without using the 
&gt; Javascript or passing by the http interface . Does riak offers something like 
&gt; that?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you!
