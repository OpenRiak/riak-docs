&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Just finished viewing Mark Allen's excellent 2015 Riak Core presentation and 
&gt; have been reviewing his Udon code on GitHub.
&gt; 
&gt; https://github.com/mrallen1
&gt; 
&gt; Now I have two Micky-the-Dunce questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Assuming a web-based system similar to Udon on a cluster of five physical 
&gt; cores with data distributed across three virtual nodes, can one enter and 
&gt; access the data through any one of the five physical nodes?
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, can one put a load balancer in front of the five physical 
&gt; nodes to enter and access data regardless of where it's ultimately stored in 
&gt; the cluster?

Yes, usually the node that handles the request has access to both the ring (a 
routing table/mapping of partitions to nodes) and the hash function.

&gt; 
&gt; 2. Can KV functionality be relatively easily built on top of Udon--- 
&gt; providing storage of, say, Erlang terms as well as files?

I haven’t looked at Udon, but a KV store on riak core is a very common thing. 
There are quite a few examples out there, the largest (and most complex) being 
Riak itself https://github.com/basho/riak

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to all,
&gt;
