Looking at http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/Client-Libraries/ I see 
that Erlang riak client should support Cluster connections/pools. But looking 
at Erlang riak client source code I would say that it doesn't support Cluster 
connections/pools out of box. And I have to develop my own code to have load 
balancing/connection pool. Is it right and the documentation is incorrect and 
needs to be updated? 

Thank you,
Konstantin. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
