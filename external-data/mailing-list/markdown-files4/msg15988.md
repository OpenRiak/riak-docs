Hi José,

Please refer to this document:

http://basho.github.io/riak-nodejs-client/classes/RiakObject.html

When you retrieve a value, you get a RiakObject back:

client.fetchValue({ bucket: 'test', key: 'foo' }, function (err, rslt) {
 var riakObj = rslt.values.shift();
});

This RiakObject exposes several methods related to metadata.

I just released version 1.1.0 which adds support for links. You'll see
that in the API docs now.

&gt; In my current implementation, I use metadata for both links and secondary

&gt;&gt; Hi José,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Other than links, what object metadata are you trying to access or modify?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks -

&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks Brian for your reply and trying to work out the links part. I
&gt;&gt; &gt; took a look at the RiakObject and could see how to manipulate it with
&gt;&gt; &gt; FetchValue and the Secondary Index. However, I failed to figure out
&gt;&gt; &gt; how to access the meta while reading an object. Just as an example,
&gt;&gt; &gt; when you're updating an object you could be using some meta data, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; some of them come from a prior read.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; If you could just share some examples with code that'd be very helpful.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
