I found the problem. It was quite annoying.
Essentially -- the systems were all valid, but Riak wouldn't recognise the
fully-qualified hostnames until I rm -rf /var/lib/riak/\* and restarted riak.

&gt; However, as far as I can see, the host does have a fully-qualified
&gt; hostname:
&gt;
&gt; root@db04:/# hostname
&gt; db04
&gt; root@db04:/# hostname -f
&gt; db04.dc.sdlocal.net
&gt;
&gt; /etc/hosts contains a line with both the short and fqdn names in it.
&gt;
&gt; Is there something else I should be checking?
