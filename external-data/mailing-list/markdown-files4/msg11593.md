Kumar,

We have a few customers who use the memory backend. The first example I
could find (with the help of our CSE team) uses the memory backend on 8
machines with 12gb of ram each.

I know you are just testing right now, but we'd suggest using 5 node
minimum. With N=3 on a 3-node cluster you could be writing multiple
replicas to the same machine.

Good luck in your testing,
-Jared

&gt; Are there known production installation of riak that uses

&gt; node cluster and looks good so far. Just wanted to find out what kind of
&gt; setup people are using in production.
