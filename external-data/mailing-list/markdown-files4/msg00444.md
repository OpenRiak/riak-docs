We don't know of anyone doing replication between clusters in a fashion other 
than the tools we provide in EnterpriseDS. Just playing the write to both 
clusters via an intermediary probably won't have the effect you desire.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Given replication is a built-in feature only in the EnterpriseDS
&gt; product, how are folks using only the open source version of Riak
&gt; handling replication? Writing to two clusters simultaneously or
&gt; something else perhaps?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you in advance.
