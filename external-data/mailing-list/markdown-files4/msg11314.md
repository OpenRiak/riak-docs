I have objects in buckets that need to be updated based on their previous
value. As per the documentation, I've implemented a sibling-resolution
strategy that can deal with the writes happening in different orders, and
implemented it on the client side. This of course requires me to set
"allow\_mult":true on each bucket.

Setting that single property takes between 10 and 20 seconds per bucket. Is
this expected?

Here is a command I can run to reproduce the very long delay (where
riak.lumi points to our Riak server):

curl -X PUT http://riak.lumi:8098/riak/test-bucket -H "Content-Type:
application/json" -d '{"props":{"allow\_mult":true}}'
