&gt; Hello,

&gt; I did an update on my Lager deps and am now experiencing some

Good catch. This was a side-effect of rewriting lager's output routines
to be ~4 times faster (and much closer to the behaviour of
io\_lib:format). I've pushed a fix and a new test to master:

There may be a couple other issues like this lurking, let me know if you
find any more. Riak is still using the 0.9.4 tag of lager (and will
continue to do so until the 1.1 release), so master, which I hope to tag
as 1.0 soon, isn't seeing quite as much scrutiny right now.
