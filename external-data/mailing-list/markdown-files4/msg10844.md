Out of curiousity, how are you planning on segmenting the data? Map reduce
will execute over the entire data set.

Also, how are you setting up your servers? Single nodes? Multiple nodes?

&gt; As a follow-up to this thread and my thread from earlier today, I am
&gt; basically looking for a simple way to extract the value of a single field
&gt; from approximately 900,000 documents (which happens to be indexed). I have
&gt; been trying many options including a map-reduce function that executes
&gt; entirely over http (taking out any python client bottlenecks). I let that
&gt; run for over an hour before I stopped it. It did not return any output.
&gt;
&gt; I also have tried grabbing a list of the 900k keys from a secondary index
&gt; (very fast, about 11 seconds) and then trying to fetch each key in parallel
&gt; (using curl and gnu parallel). That was also too slow to be feasible.
&gt;
&gt; Is there something basic that I am missing?
&gt;
&gt; One idea that I though of was to have a secondary index that is intended
&gt; to split all of my data into segments. I would use the first three
&gt; characters of the md5 of the document's key in hexadecimal format. So, the
&gt; index would contain strings like "ae1", "2f4", "5ee", etc. Then, I can run
&gt; my map-reduce query against \*each\* segment individually and possibly even
&gt; in parallel.
&gt;
&gt; I have observed that map-reduce is very fast with small sets of data (i.e.
&gt; 5,000 objects), but with 900,000 objects it does not appear to run in a
&gt; proportionately fast time. So, the idea is to divide the data into segments
&gt; that can be better handled by map-reduce.
&gt;
&gt; Before I implement this, I want to ask: Does this seem like the
&gt; appropriate way to handle this type of operation? And, is there any better
&gt; way to do this in the current version of Riak?

&gt; There are some inefficiencies in the python client... I've been profiling
&gt; it recently and found that it occasionally takes the python client longer
&gt; when you're on the same machine.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps Sean could comment?

&gt;&gt; Thanks Evan. I tried doing it in python like this (realizing that the
&gt;&gt; previous way I did it uses MapReduce) and I had better results. It finished
&gt;&gt; in 3.5 minutes, but nowhere close to the 15 seconds from the straight http
&gt;&gt; query:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; import riak
&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; bucket\_name = "mybucket"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; client = riak.RiakClient(port=8087,transport\_class=riak.RiakPbcTransport)
&gt;&gt; bucket = client.bucket(bucket\_name)
&gt;&gt; results = bucket.get\_index('status\_bin', 'PERSISTED')
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; print len(results)

&gt;&gt; &gt; get\_index() is the right function there, I think.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I can grab over 900,000 keys from an indexs, using an http query in
&gt;&gt; about 15 seconds, whereas the same operation in python times out after 5

&gt;&gt; Should I be relying on an http request initially when I need to grab this
&gt;&gt; many keys?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (Note: This is tied to the question that I asked earlier, but is also
&gt;&gt; a general question to help understand the proper usage of the python API.)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks! Examples are below.
