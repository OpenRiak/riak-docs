There are a few examples in the test cases:

Other than that, the samples in the CorrugatedIron.Samples project are all
Riak KV applications.

&gt; I was intrigued reading about link-walking with Riak. However all of the

&gt; then walk the links using a .NET driver like CorrugatedIron. I see in
&gt; CorrugatedIron there is a RiakLink so I am asumming that putting a list of
&gt; those on the “value” that is written to the database will establish the
&gt; link. Now how do I “walk” the link?I have seen the documentation on
&gt; CorrugatedIron’s web site but it would be nice to see a basic “hello world”
&gt; application.\*\*\*\*
