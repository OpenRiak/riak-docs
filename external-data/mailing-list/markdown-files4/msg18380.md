The Antidote project, developed on top of Riak Core, has many of these
properties and is under continuing development by a group in France,
Belgium, Portugal, and Germany.

https://github.com/syncfree/antidote

It's a research project at the moment, but we're working on making it
industrial grade. It shares many of the same (or better) properties:
CRDTs, causal consistency, designed for geo-replication; however,
doesn't have search functionality and only has limited client
libraries at the moment.

I'm happy to answer any other questions you might have about it.

Thanks,
Christopher

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;
&gt; As Riak's future is uncertain and despite I love it as it covers everything
&gt; I was needing, I'm on the look for another NoSQL DB that replaces it for my
&gt; project. What are your suggestions? Some of my requirements (Riak features)
&gt; would be:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Master-less (all nodes can read/write)
&gt; 2. Schema-less (except if I need a SOLR-style custom index for a certain
&gt; bucket)
&gt; 3. Replication
&gt; 4. Counters, Sets, Maps...
&gt; 5. Python client instead of REST interface
&gt; 6. Indexing (SOLR-like) for background data analysis
&gt; 7. Self-hosted (for example, DynamoDB adds latency to my communications)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Alex
