Just one more clarification - so if I have a 5 node cluster, and a pool of 
protobuffer client processes which have been balanced in a round robin manner 
across all nodes, does it matter if I have a worker gen\_server process 
&lt;0.100.0&gt; which performs write 1 to node A and then write 2 to node B (not 
concurrently) using two different protobuffer client processes (&lt;0.101.0&gt; and 
&lt;0.102.0&gt; respectively)? Are there any caveats to this approach?

No, it doesn't matter which node you're hitting.

The the receiving node will forward the request to be coordinated at the same 
node regardless, the node being determined using a hash function on the 
bucket/key pair.
