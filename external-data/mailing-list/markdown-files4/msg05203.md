&gt; The short answer: my branch puts connection management into the
&gt; transport, and Brett's patches puts that into the client. A decision
&gt; needs to be made, and that will determine future work. I've previously
&gt; emailed with an explanation for why I believe the transport class
&gt; should handle this (via a connection manager), and why (IMO) the
&gt; client should not be worrying about it. Making this decision removes
&gt; blocks for future changes (eg. timeouts).

Thoughts, Russell?
