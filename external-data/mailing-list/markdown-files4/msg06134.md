you're right. there should be better notice about this. I think the number of 
physical machines needs to be greater than n to keep this from happening. i 
also think I've seen a specific algorithm that is floating around that defines 
this behavior but i can't conjure it up at the moment. i also think the 
recommended default config is four nodes. and if its not it should be.

&gt; I'm shocked that is not considered a major bug. At minimum that kind of stuff 
&gt; should be front and center in their wiki/docs. Here I am thinking n 2 on a 3 
&gt; node cluster means I'm covered when in fact I am not. It's the whole reason I 
&gt; gave Riak consideration.
