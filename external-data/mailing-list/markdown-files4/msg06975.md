Running riak-admin times out, but only for one of my vms.


Attempting to restart script through sudo -u riak
Failed to write test value: {error,timeout}


The weird part is that this timeout will no longer happen if I remove any
of the other nodes from the cluster of four.

For example, I have nodes A,B,C,D all apart of my cluster.
riak-admin test passes on all but node A.
Removing either B,C,or D, now riak-test passes on node A.

I have verified that I can telnet to all the required ports from all the
machines.

What does riak-admin do, and why would it work and not work situationally.
