What versions(s) of Riak have allow\_mult=true by default? Which ones have
allow\_mult=false by default?

I thought this was decided in the early days of Riak. Why the back and
forth now?

&gt; This was a changed back a few weeks ago, where allow\_mult is back to false
&gt; for buckets without a type (default), but is true for buckets with a type.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for the back and forth, but we decided it would be better to keep it
&gt; as false so as to not break existing users. However, we strongly encourage
&gt; that all users choose typed buckets going forward.

&gt;&gt; In my tests, allow\_mult defaults to false for 2.0.0pre20. This was not
&gt;&gt; the case for 2.0.0pre11; my tests behave correctly under pre11.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This according to my testing with my Clojure Riak driver, Kria:
&gt;&gt; https://github.com/bluemont/kria
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My understanding is that Riak intends allow\_mult to default to true.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm using the Mac builds from:
&gt;&gt; \* http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0pre11/downloads/
&gt;&gt; \* http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0pre20/downloads/
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I also confirmed this to be the case with a Homebrew installation:
