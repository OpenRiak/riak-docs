Lately I've noticed the increased demand for a higher-level, abstract querying 
API in the Ripple document-mapper library -- something analogous to 
ActiveRecord + arel. At the current time, I'm preparing a strawman proposal for 
the feature that we can debate.

I'd like to discuss this feature in-depth on Friday with interested members of 
the community and then set about implementing it. If you would like to 
participate in the conversation, please enter your email in the form I've 
linked to below. 

HOWEVER, I only ask that if you want to be involved in the conversation, \*\*you 
should be willing to contribute some time to making this API happen\*\* 
preferably by implementing and testing needed features. As much as I like being 
a code-hero, this is too big to do by myself.

I will email the strawman proposal to participants by Thursday so you have time 
to review it. (We will likely meet on GoToMeeting, which requires Windows or 
Mac, sorry Linux users.)
