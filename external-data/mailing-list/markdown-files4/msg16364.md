Thatâ€™s correct: upgrades to either 2.0.x or 2.1.x are supported from the
1.4 series.

Side note: I definitely recommend testing the upgrade process in a QA
environment first.

Hello all, I have a 5 node riak cluster, all nodes running 1.4.2.

I want to upgrade to riak 2.x

According to this:
http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/upgrading/rolling-upgrades/ I can
perform a rolling upgrade (a mixed cluster)
as long as the versions aren't more than 2 versions apart.

There is no riak 1.5 so would riak 1.4.2 -&gt; 2.0.5 count as 1 version apart?
