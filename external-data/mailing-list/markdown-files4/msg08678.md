Guido,

Reading the comments on that pull request, I get the feeling that pcl is
suggesting that upgrading to 4.2.2 is another way to solve the problem. I
dont think that route was taken to resolve the issue. Quoting his comment...

 upgrading your dependency to 4.2.2 once it becomes available will
\*also\*resolve the issue
&gt;


I dont see a change to pom.xml during this pull. I tried the riak-client
1.0.6 and it still depends on 4.1.x. So the upgrade would be necessary to
fix the memory leak.

Thanks
Deepak Bala

&gt; I think that was fixed on the following pull request but, you would have
&gt; to compile your own client from github which is easy; or, did you get the
&gt; new 1.0.6? I'm not sure if it is already available at maven repos, anyways,
&gt; there is a lot going on in the riak client in java, I would suggest you to
&gt; keep an eye on the github, many good bugs getting fixed quickly.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; My servers complain about a leaky apache DateUtils class during hot
&gt; deployments. This is a known 
&gt; bugin http 4.1.x and 
&gt; has been fixed in 4.2.x. Can the next version of
&gt; riak-client be updated to include the newer HTTP client (the
&gt; current version is 4.1.1 ) ? Is the riak-client compatible with httpclient
&gt; 4.2.x as it is ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
