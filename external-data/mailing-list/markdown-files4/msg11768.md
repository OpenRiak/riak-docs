Dave,

Glad you are happy.

The truth is that you gained space via the backup/restore process. The data 
formats of 1.3.1 and 1.4 are the same.

leveldb only removes dead / old key/values during its background compaction. 
It could be days, even weeks in some cases, between when you write fresh 
key/values and when their old version are discarded. 

Your restore process only put the fresh keys back into the database. The old 
versions were never part of the backup.

Matthew

&gt; Thank you Basho for the new on-disk format changes to eLevelDB!

&gt; We have just migrating from 1.3.1 to 1.4.0, and since we wanted to change the 
&gt; ring size too, we used Dan Kerrigan's Data Migrator to backup/restore our 
&gt; buckets.
&gt; 
&gt; The space savings are very impressive! Each node went from using about 410 
&gt; GB to about 250 GB.
&gt; 
&gt; Terrific!
