Hi Ray,

Deletion is replicated by both real-time and full-sync MDC - specifically,
the tombstone representing the deletion will be replicated. The delete\_mode
setting affects how long a tombstone remains "alive" for MDC to replicate
it (3 seconds by default). If only full-sync MDC is used, the delete\_mode
should be modified to allow a long enough lifetime for a full-sync
operation to replicate the tombstone.

&gt; I'm about to have two data centers bi-directionally replicating and I'm

&gt;
&gt; The MDC Architecture Page says that the two clusters stream missing
&gt; objects/updates back and forth.
&gt; It does not state that any deletions will be remembered and streamed. I'm
&gt; assuming that fullsync never deletes?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And what about real-time? Those also only talk about adding missing
&gt; objects and updates.
&gt; Does real-time never replicate a deletion?
