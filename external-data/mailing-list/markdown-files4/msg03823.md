Riak Recap for June 22 - 23
=====================

1) Stephan Seidt (@evilhackerdude) is making some nice updates to his
"teriaki" repo which he is using to help serve web site assets out of
Riak.

\* Take a look here ---&gt; https://github.com/evilhackerdude/teriaki

2) ismarc and jtuple had a brief chat about whether or not it was
possible to take the results
of a reduce job and write them directly back into Riak.

\* Read here ---&gt; https://gist.github.com/1045801

3) Paolo D'Incau interviewed Dave Smith (@dizzyD) on all things
Erlang, Riak, and Basho. This one is well worth the read.

4) Russell Brown (@russelldb) added support to basho\_bench for
benchmarking the Java Client.

\* Relevant commit here ---&gt;
https://github.com/basho/basho\_bench/commit/13abff5d9313a7366fac5a396cd38d1a32130e53

5) Q --- Could you use Luwak for streaming video for example? I'm
trying to decide which solution to use for distributed file storage
system which should be able to store & stream files ranging from few
kilobytes to several hundred gigs (from qhead via #riak)

A --- Yes. That is exactly the sort of use case Luwak was designed
for. Range requests in the middle of an object are very efficient, for
example.

6) One new job for today:

\* Openx is hiring platform engineers with Riak experience ---&gt;
