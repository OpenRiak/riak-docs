&gt; Do you have an example how to stream them? The url I've posted in my
&gt; initial mail explains how to use that index, but not how to stream the
&gt; results. Unfortunately accessing the keys that way overloads the node.

&gt; With leveldb you can use the special $bucket index. You can also stream
&gt; the keys, and paginate them, meaning you can get them in smaller lumps,
&gt; hopefully this will appear faster and avoid the timeout you're seeing.

&gt; Hi Markus,
&gt; Are you using leveldb backend?

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; is there any way to get all keys from an bucket?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've already tried this guide:
&gt; http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/13/list-all-of-the-riak-keys.html But
&gt; riak always wents unresponsive with a huge server load.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and "GET /buckets/bucket/keys?keys=stream" returns an timeout error.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there any other way?
