Update: I'm working on rolling this thread into a blog post with a summary
of all these suggestions and what we're doing to address them in the short
and long term. This will be out today with any luck.

Thanks for this. Never have I been so excited by people pointing out our
shortcomings. :)

&gt; &gt; Is there 'something like redis' that doesn't introduce a single point
&gt; &gt; of failure? And a completely different set of administrative
&gt; &gt; concepts?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A different, Riak only, approach is to safe the sorted keys in a Riak
&gt; &gt; object:
&gt; &gt; - You could have a sorted list of keys in a array in a user object for
&gt; &gt; instance.
&gt;
&gt; That seems to assume that a single client has all the keys at once.
&gt; What if your clients and the data sources are distributed as well?
&gt; And if that could work reliably from a set of clients, why can't the
&gt; server side do it?
