I am not a developer advocate. But my top hate is that when machines
leave/rejoin your data can be inaccessable for some time.

We had a great case where we wanted to use Riak, but that was a
complete showstopper and we won't be using it because of that. (We
wanted to store information which needed to be read in the event of a
machine failing. But the machine that could fail would be on the same
cluster that was running Riak, so we'd be potentially trying to do
reads exactly when data was unavailable.)
