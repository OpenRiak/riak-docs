Hey Humberto,

I see you found an answer according to the gist:

"Hello, I solved the problem with the help of @Sargun in the channel of
riak at webchat.freenode.net.

The error was in the code of my message (625). This number (605 &gt;= 255)
breaks the format of 8-bit message code to identify the Protocol Buffers
message. I changed the code of my message and it works!"

That's great news. Keep coding and keep sharing!

Best,
Matt
