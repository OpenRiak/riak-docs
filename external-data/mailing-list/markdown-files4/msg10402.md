&gt; Thank you. I now have the control "working". The 'https' is crossed out in

&gt;
&gt; I notice that Objects, Map/Reduce, Graphs, Logs, and Support are greyed out. 
&gt; Is there another path to this information or are they just a work-in-progress?
&gt;

These are a WIP.

Cmeik put together a doc all about contributing to Control a few weeks
back [1] if you're interested in lending a hand.

&gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt;
&gt; If you've followed the instructions linked from the Riak Control README on 
&gt; GitHub, you should be able to just specify the path to the files you've 
&gt; built, the extension doesn't matter as long as the files are armored ASCII.
&gt;
&gt; {certfile, "/path/to/crt/file"},
&gt; {keyfile, "/path/to/key/file"}
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Let me know if that doesn't work for you.
&gt;
&gt; - Chris

&gt;&gt; I was following the instructions for setting up riak-control and I was 
&gt;&gt; diverted to instructions to create my own certificate. But from what I can 
&gt;&gt; tell I need a .pem file and the instruction donâ€™t include an explanation as 
&gt;&gt; to where the .pem file(s) come from or how to derive them. Ideas?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
