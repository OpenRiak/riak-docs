I am having a problem with a Docker image running Riak which is causing me 
concern.

I have a Docker image which is being run inside of a Vagrant container. The 
Docker image is running Riak in a CentOS 7 guest OS and is configured to start 
via a supervisor script.

The issue I am having is that when running the Vagrant VM in a MacOS host OS, 
Riak in the Docker image starts fine.

However when I run the same Vagrantfile in a Windows host OS, Riak fails to 
start with an error ‘Protocol: ~tp: the name 
riak@127.0.0.1 seems to be in use by another erlang node’

I have tried changing the codename but the error persists.

The strange thing is that Riak seems to be running as we can query it via the 
REST API. But when trying to communicate to it when logged into the Docker 
container and doing something like ‘riak ping’ we get Node 
‘riak@127.0.0.1’ not responding to pings.

Any help would be appreciated. If you need further information then please ask.
