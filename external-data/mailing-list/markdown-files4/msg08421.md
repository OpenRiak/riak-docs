&gt; Recently I discovered that my MapReduce job, that used to run

&gt; Here is the error:
&gt; {"phase":0,"error":"[timeout]","input":"{&lt;&lt;\"test\"&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;\"123\"&gt;&gt;}","type":"forward\_preflist","stack":"[]"}
&gt;
&gt; Is anyone familiar with this problem? How can I make it to work?

https://github.com/basho/riak\_kv/issues/290. That is almost certainly
the issue you're running into. I have replied there.
