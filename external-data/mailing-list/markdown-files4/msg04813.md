Yes. If you are running a default configuration, however, you will
need considerably more than 4096 file handles. You can tighten this
down by setting:

{max\_open\_files, 10}

in the eleveldb section of app.config. That will yield 10 open file
handles \_per\_ vnode -- on a out of the box setup that's 64 \* 10 file
handles necessary.
