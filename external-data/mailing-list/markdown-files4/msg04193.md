So just manually restart the nod

&gt; The presence of "heart" in the riak scripts was my attempt (way back
&gt; when) to ensure that the generic Erlang scripts provided access to as
&gt; much functionality as possible. In production usage, however, I advise
&gt; against using it.

&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt; I occasionally have a Riak node that goes down. Is recommended (or not)
to
&gt;&gt; enable the heartbeat restart of the node in /etc/riak/vm.args? Anyone
&gt;&gt; have experience with this enabled for Riak?
