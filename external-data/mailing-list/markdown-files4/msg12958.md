Happy to see Riak 2.0 being available.
May I know if the issue that was faced in Riak 1.x leveldb been solved?

The issue is about the disk space not being freed after deleting the key.
&gt;From Bashoâ€™s support, the reason is because my keys has date as prefix, 
&gt;therefore the .sst files of the deleted keys never be reused.

I also heard that this issue will be fixed in next release, may I know will it 
be in Riak 2.0?
Or there will be a smaller fix before the release of Riak 2.0?

Thanks a lot.
