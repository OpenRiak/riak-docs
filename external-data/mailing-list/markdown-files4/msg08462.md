Hi,

I have a 4 node cluster with 40M documents (20M per bucket) in it and I'm
executing a simple MR job that counts the number of documents in a given
bucket.
I used cURL to execute the job, and then decided to "kill" the cURL process
(a simple ^C). I expect this to also cancel the MR job, right? Well.. it
seems that Riak completely ignored the fact the the client is dead. Is this
related in any way to cURL or is this the normal behaviour with any client
I'll use? 
IMO it makes more sense that Riak will cancel the job once the connection
with the client is terminated. Is this a bug in Riak?

Thanks,
Shahar
