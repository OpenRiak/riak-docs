Tomer, those are new to me. You didn't mention whether you were using
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora Core, or some other RPM-based
Linux distribution (or its version/release number). It could also be
hopeful to know if you were using the 32 or 64 bit Riak package.


tn&gt; When installing the riak-1.0 rpm I'm getting the following output:

tn&gt; chcon: couldn't compute security context from unlabeled

Those are release to SELinux. If you've got SELinux enforcement
disabled, then I believe that you can ignore those messages.

tn&gt; in addition, I noticed that the app.config did not update as it
tn&gt; should on the installation process.

tn&gt; warning: /etc/riak/app.config created as /etc/riak/app.config.rpmnew
tn&gt; warning: /etc/riak/vm.args created as /etc/riak/vm.args.rpmnew

That's RPM's behavior: if the config file already exists, then the
package's new version is saved using a different file name.
