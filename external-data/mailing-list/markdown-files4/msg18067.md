Hi Daniel,

Two questions:

\* Do you happen to have an /etc/riak/app.config file present?

\* On one of your Riak nodes, could you please execute the following commands:

riak attach
rp(application:get\_all\_env(riak\_kv)).

Copy the output of the previous command and attach as a separate file
to your response. Please note that the period is significant. Use
CTRL-C CTRL-C to exit the "riak attach" session.

&gt; I do not have an advanced.config file since I switched to leveldb storage

&gt; Hopefully not relevant, the data root is on an ecryptfs volume.
