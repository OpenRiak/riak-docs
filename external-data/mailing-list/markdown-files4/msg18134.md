Hello,

I wanted to know the supported deployment mechanism for Riak in orchestration 
environments like Kubernetes/Mesos:


 1. What should be my deployment/self discovery/cluster joining mechanism in 
Kubernetes?
 2. Is Riak Mesos Framework the preferred/supported way to deploy Riak in a 
Mesos cluster?
 3. Is the Docker Container supported for production Riak deployment? I have 
seen a few answers related to this in the mail list but wanted to confirm the 
current status as I see a Docker 
project from Riak.
