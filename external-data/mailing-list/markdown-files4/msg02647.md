Hi Saurabh,

Riak Search exposes a Lucene type interface but is \*not\* Lucene based. If you 
are actually looking for a distributed Lucene solution I would tell you to look 
into Elastic Search,

&gt; Hi, 
&gt; 
&gt; Since riak search is marked as "Beta Software" on the wiki, I am skeptical to 
&gt; use it in production. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does riak offer any APIs or integration points that would allow me to index 
&gt; data into Solr ?
&gt; Specifically, I am storing key/value pairs in riak, where the value is a 
&gt; binary erlang term containing a tuple of text I would like to index. 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, going through the riak search documentation, the erlang API seems to 
&gt; only have the capability of indexing documents 
&gt; on disk as files (please correct me if this isn't true). Is there 
&gt; functionality to automatically retrieve and index documents already stored in 
&gt; riak ?
