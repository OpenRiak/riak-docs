Hi everyone,

I have a couple riak clusters and was operating on one this week. I updated the 
riak docker container on one of the nodes (updating from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2, but 
using a completely different container source), and renamed the node at the 
same time (followed the “rename” process - downed old nodename, brought up node 
with no ring, cluster join, cluster force-replace).

That was all well and good, but now “riak attach” isn’t giving me the love I 
thought I should get:

(c\_1494\_riak@172.29.18.183)1&gt; {ok, Ring} = riak\_core\_ring\_manager:get\_my\_ring().
\*\* exception error: no match of right hand side value {error,no\_ring}
(c\_1494\_riak@172.29.18.183)2&gt; 

I’d done this before my upgrade and it returned the valid ring. I can 
successfully riak ping, riak-admin ring-status, etc.

Any idea what I did? Thanks!

cheers,
