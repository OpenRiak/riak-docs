I apologize for the confusion and defer to Luke on all the technical Riak
things.

&gt; What Alexander is suggesting is what Daniel is currently using, and
&gt; what I suspect may be causing Daniel's issues.
&gt;
&gt; If you wish to run a leveldb-only Riak CS cluster, you still \*must\*
&gt; use the advanced.config file and the riak\_cs\_kv\_multi\_backend, and the
&gt; other settings that I mention in my response and in the docs. Notice
&gt; the multi\_backend\_prefix\_list setting, for one thing.
&gt;
&gt; Daniel -
&gt;
&gt; The storage\_backend setting in advanced.config will \*override\*
&gt; storage\_backend in riak.conf. If you wish to ensure the riak.conf
&gt; setting is overridden, you may comment it out in that file.

&gt; &gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Riak CS uses multi by default. By default the manifests are stored in
&gt; leveldb and the blobs/chunks are stored in bitcask. If you're looking to
&gt; force everything to level you should remove multi and use level as the
&gt; backend setting. As Luke noted elsewhere, this configuration hasn't been
&gt; fully tested and is not supported.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Off the top of my head, take a look at the email Martin (?) sent about
&gt; his modified level backend a few weeks ago for reasons why using level for
&gt; data chunks may not be the best idea at this time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Alexander

&gt; &gt; Hi Luke,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again, thanks for your help. We are currently preparing to move all
&gt; objects into a new cluster using the S3 API. One question on configuration:
&gt; currently I have "storage\_backend = leveldb" in my riak.conf. I assume that
&gt; on the new cluster, in addition to using the advanced.config you provided,
&gt; I also need to set "storage\_backend = multi" in riak.conf â€“ is that correct?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Referring back to the subject of this thread for a bit, I'm assuming
&gt; your current theory for why the (most recent) object went missing is
&gt; because we have a bad backend configuration. Note that that object went
&gt; missing weeks after it was originally written into riak, and it was
&gt; successfully retrieved many times before it went missing. Is there a way I
&gt; can query riak to verify your theory that the manifest was overwritten?
&gt; Russel Brown suggested: "I wonder if you can get the manifest and then see
&gt; if any/all of the chunks are present?" Would that help to answer the
&gt; question about why the object went missing? Can you provide any hints on
&gt; how to do that?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; While bad configuration may be the cause of this most recent object
&gt; going missing, it does not explain the original two objects that went
&gt; missing immediately after they were PUT. Those original incidents happened
&gt; when our cluster was still using bitcask/mutli backend, so should not have
&gt; been affected by bad configuration.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks for providing all of that information.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; You are missing important configuration for riak\_kv that can only be
&gt; provided in an /etc/riak/advanced.config file. Please see the following
&gt; document, especially the section to which I link here:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; http://docs.basho.com/riak/cs/2.1.1/cookbooks/configuration/riak-for-cs/#setting-up-the-proper-riak-backend
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; [
&gt; &gt;&gt; {riak\_kv, [
&gt; &gt;&gt; % NOTE: double-check this path for your environment:
&gt; &gt;&gt; {add\_paths, ["/usr/lib/riak-cs/lib/riak\_cs-2.1.1/ebin"]},
&gt; &gt;&gt; {storage\_backend, riak\_cs\_kv\_multi\_backend},
&gt; &gt;&gt; {multi\_backend\_prefix\_list, [{&lt;&lt;"0b:"&gt;&gt;, be\_blocks}]},
&gt; &gt;&gt; {multi\_backend\_default, be\_default},
&gt; &gt;&gt; {multi\_backend, [
&gt; &gt;&gt; {be\_default, riak\_kv\_eleveldb\_backend, [
&gt; &gt;&gt; {data\_root, "/opt/data/ecryptfs/riak"}
&gt; &gt;&gt; ]},
&gt; &gt;&gt; {be\_blocks, riak\_kv\_eleveldb\_backend, [
&gt; &gt;&gt; {data\_root, "/opt/data/ecryptfs/riak\_blocks"}
&gt; &gt;&gt; ]}
&gt; &gt;&gt; ]}
&gt; &gt;&gt; ]}
&gt; &gt;&gt; ].
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Your configuration will look like the above. The contents of this file
&gt; are merged with the contents of /etc/riak/riak.conf to produce the
&gt; configuration that Riak uses.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Notice that I chose riak\_kv\_eleveldb\_backend twice because of the
&gt; discussion you had previously about RAM usage and bitcask (
&gt; http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users\_lists.basho.com/2016-November/018801.html
&gt; )
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; In your current configuration, you are not using the expected prefix
&gt; for the block data. My guess is that on very rare occasions your data
&gt; happens to overwrite the manifest for a file. You may also have corrupted
&gt; files at this point without noticing it at all.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; IMPORTANT: you can't switch from your current configuration to this new
&gt; one without re-saving all of your data.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Two questions:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \* Do you happen to have an /etc/riak/app.config file present?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Not sure if relevant, but I did notice that
&gt; /etc/riak-cs/advanced.config does exist, which contradicts with what I said
&gt; earlier. This is surprising to me because I did not create this file. Maybe
&gt; it was created by the riak installer? Anyway, the content is:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; $ cat /etc/riak-cs/advanced.config
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; [
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; {riak\_cs,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; [
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ]}
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ].
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \* On one of your Riak nodes, could you please execute the following
&gt; commands:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; riak attach
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rp(application:get\_all\_env(riak\_kv)).
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Copy the output of the previous command and attach as a separate file
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to your response. Please note that the period is significant. Use
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CTRL-C CTRL-C to exit the "riak attach" session.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Attached.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
